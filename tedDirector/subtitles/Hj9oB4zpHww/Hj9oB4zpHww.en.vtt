00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to speak today about the relationship

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
between science and human values.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Now, it's generally understood that

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
questions of morality --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
are questions about which science officially has no opinion.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
It's thought that science can help us

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
get what we value,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
but it can never tell us what we ought to value.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
probably here -- think that science will never answer

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
the most important questions in human life:

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
questions like, "What is worth living for?"

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
"What is worth dying for?"

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
"What constitutes a good life?"

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
So, I'm going to argue

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
science and human values is an illusion --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and actually quite a dangerous one

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
at this point in human history.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Now, it's often said that science

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
because science deals with facts,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It's often thought that there's no description

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
of the way the world is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that can tell us how the world ought to be.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Values are a certain kind of fact.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
concerned about our fellow primates

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
than we are about insects, as indeed we are,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
of potential happiness and suffering.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now, the crucial thing to notice here

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
is that this is a factual claim:

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and the possibilities of experience

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And there's no notion,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
no version of human morality

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and human values that I've ever come across

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that is not at some point reducible

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
to a concern about conscious experience

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and its possible changes.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Even if you get your values from religion,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
even if you think that good and evil ultimately

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
relate to conditions after death --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
either to an eternity of happiness with God

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
or an eternity of suffering in hell --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And to say that such changes can persist after death

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
is itself a factual claim,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
which, of course, may or may not be true.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
in this life, for human beings,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
we know that there is a continuum of such facts.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
where mothers cannot feed their children,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
where people are murdered indiscriminately.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
towards something quite a bit more idyllic,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And we know -- we know --

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
that there are right and wrong answers

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to how to move in this space.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Probably not.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
so that when bad things happened to them

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
There are truths to be known

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
about how human communities flourish,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
whether or not we understand these truths.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And morality relates to these truths.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
from the level of the genome

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
on up to the level of economic systems

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and political arrangements.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
But if we're going to talk about human well-being

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is realized in the brain --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
whatever happens after death.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
in this life, his personality --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
his rather unfortunate personality --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
is the product of his brain.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
So the contributions of culture --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
if culture changes us, as indeed it does,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
it changes us by changing our brains.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
in how human beings flourish

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
can, at least in principle, be understood

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
neuroscience, psychology, etc.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
So, what I'm arguing is that

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
value's reduced to facts --

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
to facts about the conscious experience

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
of conscious beings.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And we can therefore visualize a space

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
of possible changes in the experience of these beings.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
with peaks and valleys that correspond

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
both personal and collective.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And one thing to notice is that perhaps

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
there are states of human well-being

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that we rarely access, that few people access.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And these await our discovery.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
mystical or spiritual.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
because of how our minds are structured

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.260
but other minds possibly could access them.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.260
that science is guaranteed to map this space,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
or that we will have scientific answers to every

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
conceivable moral question.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Laughter)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But if questions affect human well-being

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And just admitting this --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to the question of how humans flourish --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
will change the way we talk about morality,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and will change our expectations

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.260
of human cooperation in the future.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
For instance, there are 21 states in our country

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.260
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
are subjected to this every year.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.260
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
We're not talking about Connecticut.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
The creator of the universe himself

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
has told us not to spare the rod,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
lest we spoil the child --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.260
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
But we can ask the obvious question:

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Is it a good idea, generally speaking,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
to subject children to pain

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and violence and public humiliation

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and good behavior?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Laughter)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Is there any doubt

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that this question has an answer,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and that it matters?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Now, many of you might worry

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And so, how therefore can there be an

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
objective notion of well-being?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
The concept of physical health is undefined.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
When this statue was carved

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the average life expectancy was probably 30.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
It's now around 80 in the developed world.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.260
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
(Laughter)

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Notice that the fact that the concept of health

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is open, genuinely open for revision,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
does not make it vacuous.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
The distinction between a healthy person

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and a dead one

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
There may be equivalent ways to thrive;

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
so as to maximize human flourishing.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Now, why wouldn't this

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.260
undermine an objective morality?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Well think of how we talk about food:

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I would never be tempted to argue to you

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
that there must be one right food to eat.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
There is clearly a range of materials

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that constitute healthy food.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
between food and poison.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
The fact that there are many right answers

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to the question, "What is food?"

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
does not tempt us

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Many people worry

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
that a universal morality would require

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
it must always be wrong to lie,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and if you can find an exception,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
well then there's no such thing as moral truth.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Why would we think this?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Now, if you're going to play good chess,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
is very good to follow.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But it clearly admits some exceptions.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The fact that there are exceptions here does not

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
change that at all.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
What to do about them?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Well this is one thing you can do about them:

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
You can cover them up.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
that while we may not like this,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
we might think of this as "wrong"

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
in Boston or Palo Alto,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
who are we to say

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that the proud denizens of an ancient culture

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
are wrong to force their wives and daughters

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to live in cloth bags?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
to beat them with lengths of steel cable,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
or throw battery acid in their faces

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Well, who are we not to say this?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Who are we to pretend

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
that we know so little about human well-being

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
But what does voluntary mean

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
in a community where,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
when a girl gets raped,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
her father's first impulse,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.260
rather often, is to murder her out of shame?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Your daughter gets raped,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and what you want to do is kill her.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
What are the chances that represents

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.260
a peak of human flourishing?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
perfect solution in our own society.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
For instance,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
in the civilized world.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Now, granted, for many men

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
(Laughter)

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
But if we are in a reflective mood,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
we can ask,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
"Is this the perfect expression

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
of psychological balance

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
I mean, is this the optimal environment

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260
in which to raise our children?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
on the spectrum

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
between these two extremes

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
that represents a place of better balance.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:57.260
(Applause)

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Perhaps there are many such places --

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
again, given other changes in human culture

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
But the thing to notice is that there will be

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.260
many more ways not to be on a peak.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Now the irony, from my perspective,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
are religious demagogues of one form or another.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and condition of human and animal well-being.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
In fact, the endurance of religion

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.260
as a lens through which most people view moral questions

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
has separated most moral talk

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.260
from real questions of human and animal suffering.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
This is why we spend our time

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
talking about things like gay marriage

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260
or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.260
a universal conception of human values.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
Now, what stands in the way of this?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Well, one thing to notice is that we

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
do something different when talking about morality --

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
especially secular, academic, scientist types.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
meditating on compassion,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
of human happiness.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and torturing and killing young women.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
about how to profitably use one's time.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
(Laughter)

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Most Western intellectuals

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
look at this situation

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
to be really right about -- really right about --

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.260
that admits of a real argument

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
that potentially falls within the purview of science.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
that should persuade the other."

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Notice that we don't do this in science.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
On the left you have Edward Witten.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
He's a string theorist.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
If you ask the smartest physicists around

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
who is the smartest physicist around,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
(Laughter)

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.260
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
and said,"String theory is bogus.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
view the universe at a small scale.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
I'm not a fan."

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
(Laughter)

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
I don't understand string theory.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
(Laughter)

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
But this is just the point.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Whenever we are talking about facts

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
certain opinions must be excluded.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
That is what it is for knowledge to count.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
How have we convinced ourselves

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
or moral talent, or moral genius even?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
How have we convinced ourselves

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
that every opinion has to count?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
How have we convinced ourselves

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
that every culture has a point of view

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
on these subjects worth considering?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Does the Taliban

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
have a point of view on physics

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
that is worth considering? No.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.260
(Laughter)

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
How is their ignorance any less obvious

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
on the subject of human well-being?

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.260
(Applause)

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
It needs people like ourselves to admit

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
that there are right and wrong answers

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
to questions of human flourishing,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and morality relates

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
to that domain of facts.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
It is possible

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.260
for individuals, and even for whole cultures,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
to care about the wrong things,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
which is to say that it's possible for them

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
to needless human suffering.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
We live in a world in which

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
the boundaries between nations mean less and less,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
and they will one day mean nothing.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
We live in a world filled with destructive technology,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
and this technology cannot be uninvented;

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
it will always be easier

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.260
to break things than to fix them.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.260
that we can no more

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
respect and tolerate

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.260
vast differences in notions of human well-being

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
than we can respect or tolerate vast differences

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.260
in the notions about how disease spreads,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
We simply must converge

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.260
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.260
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:52.260
(Applause)

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.260
Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
hearing some of this, may well be doing the

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.260
screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
Language seems to be really important here.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
When you're talking about the veil,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.260
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.260
And some of them would say something else. They would say,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260
"No, you know, this is a celebration

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
of female specialness,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.260
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
"that male lust is not to be trusted."

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
I mean, can you engage in a conversation

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:42.260
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.260
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
watching the clock ticking,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
but the question is:

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.260
What is voluntary in a context

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
where men have certain expectations,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.260
and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
if you don't veil yourself?

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
And so, if anyone in this room

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.260
wanted to wear a veil,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.260
or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.260
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.260
but we have to be honest about

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.260
the constraints that these women are placed under.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
to always take their word for it,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
especially when it's 120 degrees out

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
and you're wearing a full burqa.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.260
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
concept of moral progress.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260
But can you reconcile that?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.260
I think I understood you to say that you could

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.260
reconcile that with a world that doesn't become

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.260
one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
Paint your picture of what

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.260
rolling the clock 50 years forward,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.260
100 years forward, how you would like to think of

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
the world, balancing moral progress

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.260
with richness.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.260
SH: Well, I think once you admit

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.260
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.260
at the level of the brain in some important detail,

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.260
then you have to admit

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.260
that we are going to understand all of the positive

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.260
and negative qualities

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.260
of ourselves in much greater detail.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.260
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.260
like empathy and compassion,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.260
and we're going to understand the factors

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.260
that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.260
whether they're how people talk to one another,

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260
whether they're economic systems,

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.260
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.260
we are inevitably going to converge

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.260
on that fact space.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.260
It's not going to be like

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.260
veiling my daughter from birth

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.260
is just as good as teaching her

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.260
to be confident and well-educated

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.260
in the context of men who do desire women.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.260
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.260
that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260
but at a certain point

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.260
we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.260
and actually interrogate them.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.260
Do people love their daughters

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.260
just as much in these systems?

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.260
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.260
CA: And if the results come out that actually they do,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.260
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.260
on some of these issues?

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.260
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.260
that you can love someone

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.260
in the context of a truly delusional belief system.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.260
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.260
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.260
I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.260
If you get all those parts aligned,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.260
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.260
But again, then we have to talk about

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.260
well-being in a larger context.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.260
It's all of us in this together,

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.260
not one man feeling ecstasy

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.260
and then blowing himself up on a bus.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260
CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
continue for hours.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.260
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.260
SH: Really an honor. Thank you.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.260
(Applause)
