00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.543
TED is 30.

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:17.181
The world wide web is celebrating this month

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:19.453
its 25th anniversary.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.142
So I've got a question for you.

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:26.966
Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.681
Let's talk about the state.

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.995
Let's talk about what sort of a web we want.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:34.315
So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.665
I got permission in the end after about a year

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:39.297
to basically do it as a side project.

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:40.995
I wrote the code.

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.144
I was I suppose the first user.

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:45.687
There was a lot of concern

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:47.206
that people didn't want to pick it up

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:49.030
because it would be too complicated.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.749
A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.459
collaboration with other people,

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.888
and bit by bit, it worked.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.531
It took off. It was pretty cool.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.748
And in fact, a few years later in 2000,

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.950
five percent of the world population

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.769
were using the world wide web.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.480
In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.820
In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.394
partly to look at that

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:16.244
and worry about that figure.

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:18.303
And now here we are in 2014,

00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:20.537
and 40 percent of the world

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:24.553
are using the world wide web, and counting.

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.555
Obviously it's increasing.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:29.963
I want you to think about both sides of that.

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:32.180
Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.163
the first question you ask is, what can we do

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:37.219
to get the other 60 percent on board

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.539
as quickly as possible?

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.854
Lots of important things. Obviously
it's going to be around mobile.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.834
But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:44.544
because if you're sitting there yourself

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:47.170
sort of with a web-enabled life,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.466
you don't remember things anymore,

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.180
you just look them up,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.263
then you may feel that it's been a success

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.243
and we can all sit back.

00:01:56.243 --> 00:01:59.326
But in fact, yeah, it's been a success,

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.272
there's lots of things, Khan Academy

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:03.561
for crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.378
there's a huge number of free e-books

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.784
that you can read online,

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.552
lots of wonderful things for education,

00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:10.276
things in many areas.

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:12.678
Online commerce has in some cases

00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:15.469
completely turned upside down the
way commerce works altogether,

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.024
made types of commerce available

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:19.350
which weren't available at all before.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.732
Commerce has been almost universally affected.

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:24.999
Government, not universally affected,

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.112
but very affected, and on a good day,

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:30.080
lots of open data, lots of e-government,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.783
so lots of things which are visible

00:02:32.783 --> 00:02:34.411
happening on the web.

00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:36.522
Also, lots of things which are less visible.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.925
The healthcare, late at night when they're worried

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.636
about what sort of cancer

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.761
somebody they care about might have,

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:47.767
when they just talk across the Internet to somebody

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:52.276
who they care about very much in another country.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.495
Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there,

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.715
and in fact they've acquired
a certain amount of privacy.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:02.499
So we cannot assume that part of the web,

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.590
part of the deal with the web,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.026
is when I use the web,

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:08.416
it's just a transparent, neutral medium.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.952
I can talk to you over it without worrying

00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:13.811
about what we in fact now know is happening,

00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.261
without worrying about the fact

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.207
that not only will surveillance be happening

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:21.245
but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:22.451
So in fact, something we realized,

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.860
we can't just use the web,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.545
we have to worry about

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:29.119
what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:33.315
is it in fact of a quality that we need?

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:38.264
We revel in the fact that we
have this wonderful free speech.

00:03:38.264 --> 00:03:41.302
We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:44.227
can see our tweets, except when they can't,

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:47.578
except when actually Twitter
is blocked from their country,

00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:50.921
or in some way the way we try to express ourselves

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.856
has put some information
about the state of ourselves,

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:55.219
the state of the country we live in,

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.703
which isn't available to anybody else.

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.684
So we must protest and make sure

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:02.808
that censorship is cut down,

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.382
that the web is opened up

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:06.839
where there is censorship.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.549
We love the fact that the web is open.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.754
It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:13.592
It doesn't matter who we are.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:14.929
And then we join these big

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.582
social networking companies

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.944
which are in fact effectively built as silos,

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:22.733
so that it's much easier to talk to somebody

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:24.567
in the same social network

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:26.890
than it is to talk to somebody in a different one,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.264
so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.

00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:34.190
And we also have, if you've read
the book about the filter bubble,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.158
the filter bubble phenomenon is that

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:37.960
we love to use machines

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.092
which help us find stuff we like.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:42.434
So we love it when we're bathed in

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:44.166
what things we like to click on,

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:46.326
and so the machine automatically feeds us

00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:47.810
the stuff that we like and we end up

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.071
with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.260
called a filter bubble.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.203
So here are some of the things which maybe

00:04:56.203 --> 00:04:59.295
threaten the social web we have.

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:01.224
What sort of web do you want?

00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:04.662
I want one which is not
fragmented into lots of pieces,

00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:06.845
as some countries have been suggesting

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.945
they should do in reaction to recent surveillance.

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:13.628
I want a web which has got, for example,

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:16.588
is a really good basis for democracy.

00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:21.165
I want a web where I can use healthcare

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:22.920
with privacy and where there's a lot

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.090
of health data, clinical data is available

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.020
to scientists to do research.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.710
I want a web where the other 60 percent

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.050
get on board as fast as possible.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.668
I want a web which is such
a powerful basis for innovation

00:05:37.668 --> 00:05:39.051
that when something nasty happens,

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.380
some disaster strikes, that we can respond

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.160
by building stuff to respond to it very quickly.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.090
So this is just some of the things that I want,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.526
from a big list, obviously it's longer.

00:05:50.526 --> 00:05:51.767
You have your list.

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.541
I want us to use this 25th anniversary

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.534
to think about what sort of a web we want.

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.233
You can go to webat25.org

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:00.236
and find some links.

00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:01.292
There are lots of sites where people

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.004
have started to put together a Magna Carta,

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.530
a bill of rights for the web.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.043
How about we do that?

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:11.670
How about we decide, these are, in a way,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.330
becoming fundamental rights, the right
to communicate with whom I want.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.288
What would be on your list for that Magna Carta?

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:20.156
Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:22.398
for the web.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:24.490
Let's do that this year.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.797
Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary

00:06:27.797 --> 00:06:30.409
to crowdsource a Magna Carta

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.891
to the web. (Applause)

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:36.397
Thank you. And do me a favor, will you?

00:06:36.397 --> 00:06:38.963
Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks.

00:06:38.963 --> 00:06:42.950
(Applause)
