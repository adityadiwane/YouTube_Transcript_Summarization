00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.039
I'd like you all

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.707
to ask yourselves a question

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.274
which you may never have
asked yourselves before:

00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:25.637
What is possible with the human voice?

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:33.885
What is possible with the human voice?

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:43.461
(Beatboxing)

00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:00.838

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.056
Yeah.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.919
(Applause)

00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:39.319
(Boomerang noises)

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:43.192
It was coming straight for me.
I had to. It was, yeah.

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:46.304
As you can probably well imagine,

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:48.903
I was a strange child.

00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:55.394
(Laughter)

00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:58.305
Because the thing is,
I was constantly trying

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.439
to extend my repertoire of noises to be

00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:04.999
the very maximum that it could be.

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:07.357
I was constantly experimenting
with these noises.

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:09.335
And I'm still on that mission.

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.141
I'm still trying to find every noise

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.440
that I can possibly make.

00:02:13.464 --> 00:02:15.704
And the thing is, I'm a bit
older and wiser now,

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:17.395
and I know that there's some noises

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.705
I'll never be able to make
because I'm hemmed in

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.103
by my physical body,
and there's things it can't do.

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:25.318
And there's things that no
one's voice can do.

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:28.752
For example, no one can do
two notes at the same time.

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.417
You can do two-tone singing,

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.966
which monks can do, which is like...

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:43.859
(Two-tone singing)

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:46.465
But that's cheating.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.331
And it hurts your throat.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.542
So there's things you can't
do, and these limitations

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.840
on the human voice have
always really annoyed me,

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:58.104
because beatbox is the best way of getting

00:02:58.128 --> 00:03:01.526
musical ideas out of your head
and into the world,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.418
but they're sketches at best,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.160
which is what's annoyed me.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.588
If only, if only there was a way

00:03:07.612 --> 00:03:10.389
for these ideas to come out unimpeded

00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:15.075
by the restrictions
which my body gives it.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.464
So I've been working with these guys,

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:21.249
and we've made a machine.

00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:23.596
We've made a system which is basically

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.922
a live production machine,

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:30.639
a real-time music production machine,

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:34.574
and it enables me to, using
nothing but my voice,

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:38.876
create music in real time
as I hear it in my head

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.394
unimpeded by any physical restrictions

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:43.500
that my body might place on me.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:47.373
And I'm going to show you what it can do.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:51.259
And before I start making noises with it,

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:53.677
and using it to manipulate my voice,

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.606
I want to reiterate that everything
that you're about to hear

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.212
is being made by my voice.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:03.169
This system has --

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:05.575
thank you, beautiful assistant --

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.735
this system has no sounds in it itself

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.559
until I start putting sounds in it,

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:16.415
so there's no prerecorded
samples of any kind.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.716
So once this thing really gets going,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.645
and it really starts to mangle
the audio I'm putting into it,

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.599
it becomes not obvious
that it is the human voice,

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:27.338
but it is, so I'm going to take
you through it bit by bit

00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:29.065
and start nice and simple.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:31.488
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.

00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:33.652
How do I get around the problem

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:35.926
of really wanting to have
as many different voices

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.189
going on at the same time.

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.547
The simplest way to do it
is something like this.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:45.351
(Beatboxing)

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.326
By dancing. It's like this.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.965
(Music)

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:20.591
Thanks.

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.944
(Applause)

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:26.190
So that's probably the easiest way.

00:05:26.214 --> 00:05:29.556
But if you want to do something
a little bit more immediate,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.216
something that you can't
achieve with live looping,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.240
there's other ways to layer your voice up.

00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:35.184
There's things like pitch-shifting,

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:36.863
which are awesome,

00:05:36.887 --> 00:05:38.751
and I'm going to show you
now what that sounds like.

00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:41.360
So I'm going to start
another beat for you, like this.

00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:49.060
(Beatboxing)

00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:50.725
There's always got to be a bit
of a dance at the start,

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.358
because it's just fun, so

00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:54.888
you can clap along if you want.

00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:57.431
You don't have to. It's fine.
Check it out.

00:05:57.455 --> 00:06:01.711
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:08.310
(Music)

00:06:11.543 --> 00:06:15.651
And now, a rockabilly guitar.

00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:31.134
Which is nice. But what if I want
to make, say, a -- (Applause) --

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:33.797
Thanks. What if I want
to make, say, a rock organ?

00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.711
Is that possible? Yes, it is,

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:38.895
by recording myself like this.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.863
(Organ sound)

00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:46.419
And now I have that, I have that recorded.

00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:47.943
Assign it to a keyboard.

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:51.573
(Music)

00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:53.342
So that's cool.

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.330
(Applause)

00:06:55.354 --> 00:07:01.206
But what if I wanted to sound
like the whole of Pink Floyd?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.975
Impossible, you say. No.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.814
It is possible, and you
can do it very simply

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:10.782
using this machine. It's really fantastic.
Check it out.

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:27.779
(Music)

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:47.949
So every noise you can
hear there is my voice.

00:07:47.973 --> 00:07:52.121
I didn't just trigger something
which sounds like that.

00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:54.241
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.165
That is literally all my voice
being manipulated,

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:01.064
and when you get to that point,
you have to ask, don't you,

00:08:01.088 --> 00:08:02.852
what's the point?

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:06.973
Why do this? (Laughter)

00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:09.712
Because it's cheaper than hiring
the whole of Pink Floyd,

00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:11.428
I suppose, is the easy answer.

00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:15.084
But in actual fact,
I haven't made this machine

00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:17.900
so that I can emulate
things that already exist.

00:08:17.924 --> 00:08:20.161
I've made this so that I can make

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:21.566
any noise that I can imagine.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.546
So with your permission, I'm going to do

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.827
some things that are in my mind,

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:28.406
and I hope you enjoy them,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.576
because they're rather unusual,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.549
especially when you're
doing things which are

00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:37.065
as unusual as this, it
can be hard to believe

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:38.944
that it is all my voice, you see.

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:47.885
(Voice effects)

00:08:52.177 --> 00:09:03.389
(Music)

00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:15.395
Like this.

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:20.976
(Music)

00:10:46.572 --> 00:10:50.649
So, loosely defined,

00:10:50.673 --> 00:10:54.499
that is what's possible
with the human voice.

00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:56.523
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:56.547 --> 00:11:01.947
(Applause)
