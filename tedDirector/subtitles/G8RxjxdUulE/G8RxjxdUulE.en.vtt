00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.777
You may never have heard
of Kenema, Sierra Leone

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.333
or Arua, Nigeria.

00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:21.128
But I know them as two of the most
extraordinary places on earth.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:27.009
In hospitals there, there's a community
of nurses, physicians and scientists

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.590
that have been quietly battling

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:31.314
one of the deadliest threats
to humanity for years:

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:32.512
Lassa virus.

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:35.256
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.513
It can cause a severe fever
and can often be fatal.

00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:42.992
But these individuals,
they risk their lives every day

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.933
to protect the individuals
in their communities,

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:48.537
and by doing so, protect us all.

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:52.001
But one of the most extraordinary things
I learned about them

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:54.592
on one of my first visits
out there many years ago

00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:56.325
was that they start each morning --

00:00:56.349 --> 00:01:01.292
these challenging, extraordinary days
on the front lines -- by singing.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.070
They gather together,
and they show their joy.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:06.616
They show their spirit.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.799
And over the years,

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:10.936
from year after year as I've visited them
and they've visited me,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.953
I get to gather with them and I sing

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:15.151
and we write and we love it,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.718
because it reminds us that we're not
just there to pursue science together;

00:01:18.742 --> 00:01:21.059
we're bonded through a shared humanity.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:25.909
And that of course, as you can imagine,
becomes extremely important,

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.706
even essential, as things begin to change.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.519
And that changed a great deal
in March of 2014,

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:35.889
when the Ebola outbreak
was declared in Guinea.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:38.558
This is the first outbreak in West Africa,

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:41.024
near the border
of Sierra Leone and Liberia.

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:44.596
And it was frightening,
frightening for us all.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.532
We had actually suspected for some time

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:49.198
that Lassa and Ebola were more
widespread than thought,

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:51.531
and we thought it could
one day come to Kenema.

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.306
And so members of my team
immediately went out

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.727
and joined Dr. Humarr Khan
and his team there,

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.428
and we set up diagnostics to be able
to have sensitive molecular tests

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.605
to pick up Ebola if it came
across the border

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.892
and into Sierra Leone.

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:06.912
We'd already set up this kind
of capacity for Lassa virus,

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:08.093
we knew how to do it,

00:02:08.117 --> 00:02:09.547
the team is outstanding.

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.808
We just had to give them
the tools and place to survey for Ebola.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.968
And unfortunately, that day came.

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:19.973
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked
into the maternity ward at the hospital,

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:23.723
and the team ran
those important molecular tests

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.582
and they identified the first
confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:30.156
This was an exceptional
work that was done.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.440
They were able to diagnose
the case immediately,

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.777
to safely treat the patient

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.819
and to begin to do contact tracing
to follow what was going on.

00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:39.815
It could've stopped something.

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.686
But by the time that day came,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.068
the outbreak had already
been breeding for months.

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:48.732
With hundreds of cases, it had already
eclipsed all previous outbreaks.

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:52.400
And it came into Sierra Leone
not as that singular case,

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:53.716
but as a tidal wave.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.395
We had to work
with the international community,

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.125
with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,
to begin to deal with the cases,

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.220
as the next week brought 31,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.918
then 92, then 147 cases --
all coming to Kenema,

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:09.243
one of the only places in Sierra Leone
that could deal with this.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.009
And we worked around the clock
trying to do everything we could,

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:15.994
trying to help the individuals,
trying to get attention,

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:17.965
but we also did one other simple thing.

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:22.333
From that specimen that we take
from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,

00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:24.412
we can discard it, obviously.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:28.052
The other thing we can do is, actually,
put in a chemical and deactivate it,

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:30.806
so just place it into a box
and ship it across the ocean,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.981
and that's what we did.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:34.101
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:38.561
And we also worked around the clock
doing shift work, day after day,

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:42.454
and we quickly generated 99 genomes
of the Ebola virus.

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:45.535
This is the blueprint -- the genome
of a virus is the blueprint.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.718
We all have one.

00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:48.687
It says everything that makes up us,

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.620
and it tells us so much information.

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:53.821
The results of this kind of work
are simple and they're powerful.

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:56.866
We could actually take
these 99 different viruses,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.337
look at them and compare them,

00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.207
and we could see, actually,
compared to three genomes

00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:04.067
that had been previously
published from Guinea,

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.802
we could show that the outbreak
emerged in Guinea months before,

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.668
once into the human population,

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.364
and from there had been transmitting
from human to human.

00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:13.932
Now, that's incredibly important

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:16.324
when you're trying to figure out
how to intervene,

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:18.414
but the important thing
is contact tracing.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:21.840
We also could see that as the virus
was moving between humans,

00:04:21.864 --> 00:04:23.121
it was mutating.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.296
And each of those mutations
are so important,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.640
because the diagnostics, the vaccines,

00:04:27.664 --> 00:04:29.149
the therapies that we're using,

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:32.531
are all based on that genome
sequence, fundamentally --

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:33.776
that's what drives it.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.682
And so global health experts
would need to respond,

00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:37.903
would have to develop,

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:40.480
to recalibrate everything
that they were doing.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:44.260
But the way that science works,
the position I was in at that point

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.435
is, I had the data,

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:48.095
and I could have worked
in a silo for many, many months,

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.318
analyzed the data carefully, slowly,

00:04:50.342 --> 00:04:53.802
submitted the paper for publication,
gone through a few back-and-forths,

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.955
and then finally when the paper came out,
might release that data.

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.183
That's the way the status quo works.

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:01.778
Well, that was not going to work
at this point, right?

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.410
We had friends on the front lines

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:06.688
and to us it was just obvious
that what we needed is help,

00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:07.868
lots of help.

00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:09.289
So the first thing we did is,

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:11.998
as soon as the sequences
came off the machines,

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:13.451
we published it to the web.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:16.311
We just released it to the whole world
and said, "Help us."

00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:17.670
And help came.

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:18.856
Before we knew it,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.216
we were being contacted
from people all over,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.684
surprised to see the data
out there and released.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.960
Some of the greatest
viral trackers in the world

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:28.063
were suddenly part of our community.

00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:30.417
We were working together
in this virtual way,

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:33.422
sharing, regular calls, communications,

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:36.197
trying to follow the virus
minute by minute,

00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.442
to see ways that we could stop it.

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:42.785
And there are so many ways
that we can form communities like that.

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:47.507
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak
started to expand globally,

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.121
was reaching out to learn,
to participate, to engage.

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:53.382
Everybody wants to play a part.

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:56.186
The amount of human capacity
out there is just amazing,

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.933
and the Internet connects us all.

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:01.208
And could you imagine that instead
of being frightened of each other,

00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:03.089
that we all just said, "Let's do this.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.636
Let's work together,
and let's make this happen."

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.402
But the problem is that the data
that all of us are using,

00:06:08.426 --> 00:06:12.463
Googling on the web, is just too limited
to do what we need to do.

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:15.138
And so many opportunities
get missed when that happens.

00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:17.643
So in the early part
of the epidemic from Kenema,

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.409
we'd had 106 clinical records
from patients,

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:23.267
and we once again made that
publicly available to the world.

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:26.961
And in our own lab, we could show
that you could take those 106 records,

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:30.603
we could train computers to predict
the prognosis for Ebola patients

00:06:30.627 --> 00:06:32.404
to near 100 percent accuracy.

00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:34.525
And we made an app
that could release that,

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.319
to make that available
to health-care workers in the field.

00:06:37.343 --> 00:06:40.602
But 106 is just not enough
to make it powerful,

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:41.777
to validate it.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:44.455
So we were waiting for more data
to release that.

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.523
and the data has still not come.

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:49.079
We are still waiting, tweaking away,

00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:51.941
in silos rather than working together.

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:54.197
And this just -- we can't accept that.

00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:58.025
Right? You, all of you,
cannot accept that.

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.731
It's our lives on the line.

00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:01.466
And in fact, actually,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.033
many lives were lost,
many health-care workers,

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:05.951
including beloved colleagues of mine,

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:09.722
five colleagues:
Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:13.757
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
and Mohamed Fullah.

00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:16.307
These are just five
of many health-care workers

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.095
at Kenema and beyond

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.155
that died while the world waited
and while we all worked,

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:23.039
quietly and separately.

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:25.096
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.004
it's fueled by mistrust
and distraction and division.

00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:32.801
When we build barriers amongst ourselves
and we fight amongst ourselves,

00:07:32.825 --> 00:07:34.645
the virus thrives.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.461
But unlike all threats to humanity,

00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:39.131
Ebola is one where
we're actually all the same.

00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:41.035
We're all in this fight together.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.693
Ebola on one person's doorstep
could soon be on ours.

00:07:44.177 --> 00:07:46.979
And so in this place
with the same vulnerabilities,

00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:49.416
the same strengths,
the same fears, the same hopes,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.649
I hope that we work together with joy.

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:57.497
A graduate student of mine
was reading a book about Sierra Leone,

00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:59.855
and she discovered that the word "Kenema,"

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:03.322
the hospital that we work at and the city
where we work in Sierra Leone,

00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:07.527
is named after the Mende word
for "clear like a river, translucent

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.138
and open to the public gaze."

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.984
That was really profound for us,

00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:13.102
because without knowing it,
we'd always felt

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:16.310
that in order to honor the individuals
in Kenema where we worked,

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:20.621
we had to work openly, we had to share
and we had to work together.

00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:22.251
And we have to do that.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:26.036
We all have to demand that
of ourselves and others --

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.934
to be open to each other
when an outbreak happens,

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.608
to fight in this fight together.

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:33.541
Because this is not the first
outbreak of Ebola,

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:35.013
it will not be the last,

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:38.192
and there are many other microbes
out there that are lying in wait,

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:39.641
like Lassa virus and others.

00:08:39.665 --> 00:08:41.174
And the next time this happens,

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:44.394
it could happen in a city of millions,
it could start there.

00:08:44.418 --> 00:08:47.117
It could be something
that's transmitted through the air.

00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:49.288
It could even be
disseminated intentionally.

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:52.293
And I know that that is frightening,
I understand that,

00:08:52.317 --> 00:08:54.971
but I know also,
and this experience shows us,

00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:58.315
that we have the technology
and we have the capacity

00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.934
to win this thing,

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.804
to win this and have
the upper hand over viruses.

00:09:02.828 --> 00:09:05.100
But we can only do it if we do it together

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:06.321
and we do it with joy.

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:08.392
So for Dr. Khan

00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:12.582
and for all of those who sacrificed
their lives on the front lines

00:09:12.606 --> 00:09:15.006
in this fight with us always,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.837
let us be in this fight with them always.

00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:19.736
And let us not let the world be defined

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.879
by the destruction wrought by one virus,

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:24.684
but illuminated by billions
of hearts and minds

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:25.916
working in unity.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.114
Thank you.

00:09:27.138 --> 00:09:34.007
(Applause)
