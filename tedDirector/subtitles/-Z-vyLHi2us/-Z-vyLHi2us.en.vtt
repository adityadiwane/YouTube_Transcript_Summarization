00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's start with day and night.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Life evolved under conditions

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
of light and darkness,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
light and then darkness.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And so plants and animals

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
developed their own internal clocks

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
so that they would be ready for these changes in light.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
These are chemical clocks,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and in some that only have one cell.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'll give you an example --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and you fly it all the way across the continent,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and you drop it into a sloped cage,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
it will scramble up the floor of the cage

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
as the tide is rising

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
on its home shores,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
thousands of miles away.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It'll do this for weeks,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
until it kind of gradually loses the plot.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And it's incredible to watch,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So, we have this ability as well.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
for a couple of months. (Laughter)

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
People actually volunteer for this,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and they usually come out

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
they all show the same thing.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
over the course of the weeks.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
rather than somehow sensing the day outside.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So fine, we have a body clock,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It's a huge driver for culture

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
We evolved as a species near the equator,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and so we're very well-equipped

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
to deal with 12 hours of daylight

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and 12 hours of darkness.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and in Arctic Canada, where I live,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
we have perpetual daylight in summer

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and 24 hours of darkness in winter.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
traditionally has been highly seasonal.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
you enjoy your family life inside.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and working activity very long hours,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
very active.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
What would our sleeping patterns be

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
in the sort of ideal sense?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Well, it turns out

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
that when people are living

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
without any sort of artificial light at all,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
they sleep twice every night.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
until midnight

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and then again, they sleep

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And in-between, they have a couple of hours

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
of sort of meditative quiet in bed.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And during this time,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
there's a surge of prolactin,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
the likes of which a modern day never sees.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
The people in these studies

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
report feeling so awake during the daytime,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that they realize

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
they're experiencing true wakefulness

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
for the first time in their lives.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
So, cut to the modern day.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We're living in a culture of jet lag,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
global travel,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
24-hour business,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
shift work.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And you know, our modern ways

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of doing things

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
have their advantages,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
but I believe we should understand the costs.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Thank you.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
(Applause)
