00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
So the question is, what is invisible?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
There is more of it than you think, actually.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
except every thing and except matter.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.160
We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.160
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
when the husband was killed by the wife."

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
(Laughter)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
(Laughter)

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
So, we can see the stars and the planets,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
but we can't see what holds them apart

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
or what draws them together.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
We can't see into the engine room.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
if you look at the basic substructure of matter,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
there isn't anything there.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
and there is only energy. And you can't see energy.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
One slightly silly thing that's invisible

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
is this story, which is invisible to you.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
(Laughter)

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
saying how much she admired him,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
(Laughter)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
she turns it to her advantage.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
A photo is not enough."

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.160
(Laughter)

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
(Laughter)

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
So, one of the interesting things about invisibility

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
is that things that we can't see

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
we also can't understand.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Gravity is one thing that we can't see

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and which we don't understand.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
and the weakest.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
That's what he thought he was there for.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
(Laughter)

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
Consciousness. I see all your faces.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.160
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
which some claim is the route of all religions,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
But their main exercise of telepathy

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.160
is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
So that's why we don't think it exists,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
the Sufi masters working on us.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
In the question of consciousness

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and artificial intelligence,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
(Laughter)

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Remind you of anyone?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
I'm an ignostic.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
until somebody properly defines the terms.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
(Laughter)

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And this is increasingly peculiar,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Geneticists will know this, but every year since,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
it's been revised downwards.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
genes in the human genome.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
This is extraordinary. Because rice -- get this --

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Two more than people,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
and the same as a gorilla.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
(Laughter)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
You can't see these things, but they are very strange.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
(Laughter)

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
The universe disappears.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
The more light there is, the less you can see.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Time, nobody can see time.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
there is a big movement in modern physics

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
to decide that time doesn't really exist,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
because it's too inconvenient for the figures.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
It's much easier if it's not really there.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
You can't see the future, obviously.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
And you can't see the past, except in your memory.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
One of the interesting things about the past is

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
which is great news for psychoanalysts,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
because otherwise they'd be out of a job.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Because that's where all the stuff happens

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
(Laughter)

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
that makes you who you are.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Taste buds, every 10 days or so.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
remains from what was there seven years ago.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
The question is, who, then, are we?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
that is actually us?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Gas, you can't see that.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Gas was invented in 1600

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
It's said to be the most successful ever invention

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
of a word by a known individual.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Quite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
meaning astral radiation.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
(Laughter)

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
But well done, him.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.160
(Laughter)

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
There is so many things that -- Light.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
you can only see what it hits.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
not to be able to see darkness.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
Electricity, you can't see that.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
They don't. Nobody knows what it is.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160
(Laughter)

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
when you turn the light on. They don't.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Electrons bumble down the wire,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
about the speed of spreading honey, they say.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
(Laughter)

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Radio waves. There's another thing.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
he called them radio waves because they radiated.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
And somebody said to him,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
And he said, "Well, I've no idea.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
Anyway, so the biggest thing

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
that's invisible to us is what we don't know.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
It is incredible how little we know.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
Thomas Edison once said,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
"We don't know one percent of one millionth

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
about anything."

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
And I've come to the conclusion --

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
The point, most of us. What's the point?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
(Laughter)

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160
(Applause)

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
like an electron, oddly enough.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
But the point, what I've got it down to,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
is there are only two questions really worth asking.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160
And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.160
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
"I don't know why we are here.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.160
(Laughter)

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
(Laughter)

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
one of my favorite poets, who said,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
"We are here on earth

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
to help others.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
What the others are here for, I've no idea."

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
(Laughter)

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.160
(Applause)
