00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.555
(Music)

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:23.221
For any of you who have visited
or lived in New York City,

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:28.116
these shots might start to look familiar.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:29.800
This is Central Park,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.536
one of the most beautifully designed

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:34.432
public spaces in America.

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:36.934
But to anyone who hasn't visited,

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:40.565
these images can't really fully convey.

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.610
To really understand Central Park,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.769
you have to physically be there.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.874
Well, the same is true of the music,

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.671
which my brother and I composed and mapped

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.757
specifically for Central Park.

00:00:55.757 --> 00:01:00.815
(Music)

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.641
I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work

00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:06.798
that my brother Hays and I are doing --

00:01:06.798 --> 00:01:10.244
That's us there. That's both of us actually â€”

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:14.051
specifically about a concept that we've been
developing over the last few years,

00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.660
this idea of location-aware music.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.614
Now, my brother and I, we're musicians

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:21.253
and music producers.

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:22.889
We've been working together since,

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.901
well, since we were kids, really.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.500
But recently, we've become
more and more interested

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.420
in projects where art

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.248
and technology intersect,

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:34.475
from creating sight-specific audio

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.347
and video installation

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:39.349
to engineering interactive concerts.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.996
But today I want to focus on this concept

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:45.738
of composition for physical space.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.187
But before I go too much further into that,

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:49.900
let me tell you a little bit about how we got started

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.737
with this idea.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.792
My brother and I were living in New York City

00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:55.579
when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.808
did their temporary installation, The Gates,

00:01:57.808 --> 00:01:59.629
in Central Park.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.273
Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:04.475
decorated the park for a number of weeks,

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:06.407
and unlike work that's exhibited

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:07.955
in a more neutral space,

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.110
like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.421
this was work that was really in dialogue

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.801
with this place,

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.733
and in a lot of ways, The Gates

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:18.189
was really a celebration

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.922
of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:23.184
This was an experience that stayed with us

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.453
for a long time, and years later,

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:28.278
my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:30.555
and we started to ask the question,

00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:32.319
would it be possible,

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.760
in the same way that The Gates

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.958
responded to the physical layout of the park,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.800
to compose music for a landscape?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.447
Which brought us to this.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:49.369
(Music)

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.005
On Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.493
a location-aware album

00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:58.210
released exclusively as a mobile app

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.921
that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:04.706
to sonically map the entire park

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:10.460
in our hometown of Washington, D.C.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.481
Hundreds of musical segments

00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:15.742
are geo-tagged throughout the entire park

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.586
so that as a listener traverses the landscape,

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:21.995
a musical score is actually unfolding around them.

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.235
So this is not a playlist or a list of songs

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.790
intended for the park,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.786
but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:32.083
that fit together like pieces of a puzzle

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.646
and blend seamlessly

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.112
based on a listener's chosen trajectory.

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:37.483
So think of this as

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.024
a choose-your-own-adventure of an album.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:41.616
Let's take a closer look.

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:43.404
Let's look at one example here.

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:45.682
So using the app,

00:03:45.682 --> 00:03:47.956
as you make your way towards the grounds

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.778
surrounding the Washington Monument,

00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:53.989
you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.997
which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron

00:03:56.997 --> 00:04:01.759
spelling out a very simple melody.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.595
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:11.992
Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,

00:04:11.992 --> 00:04:14.094
until you finally reach the top of the hill

00:04:14.094 --> 00:04:16.844
and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks

00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.130
and all sorts of musical craziness,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.943
as if all of these sounds are radiating out

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:23.783
from this giant obelisk that punctuates

00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:26.712
the center of the park.

00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:29.501
But were you to walk in the opposite direction,

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:34.872
this entire sequence happens in reverse.

00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:38.072
And were you to actually exit
the perimeter of the park,

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:40.294
the music would fade to silence,

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:43.671
and the play button would disappear.

00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:46.719
We're sometimes contacted by 
people in other parts of the world

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.646
who can't travel to the United States,

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:50.797
but would like to hear this record.

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:53.440
Well, unlike a normal album,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.728
we haven't been able to accommodate this request.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:58.726
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,

00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:00.922
we just can't make that happen,

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.100
and the reason is because

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.085
this isn't a promotional app

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:07.534
or a game to promote or accompany

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.819
the release of a traditional record.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.553
In this case, the app is the work itself,

00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:15.436
and the architecture of the landscape

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:20.079
is intrinsic to the listening experience.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.947
Six months later, we did a location-aware album

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.488
for Central Park,

00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:27.760
a park that is over two times
the size of the National Mall,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.144
with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:33.556
to the Ramble to the Reservoir.

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.559
Currently, my brother and I are working on

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.876
projects all over the country,

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:40.124
but last spring we started a project,

00:05:40.124 --> 00:05:41.785
here actually at Stanford's

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:44.377
Experimental Media Art Department,

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:47.335
where we're creating our largest
location-aware album to date,

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:49.425
one that will span the entirety of Highway 1

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:51.715
here on the Pacific Coast.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:55.865
But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,

00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:58.368
is really just one idea.

00:05:58.368 --> 00:06:00.706
But it speaks to a larger vision

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:02.855
for a music industry that's sometimes struggled

00:06:02.855 --> 00:06:05.687
to find its footing in this digital age,

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:08.152
that they begin to see these new technologies

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:10.397
not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:12.254
to an existing model,

00:06:12.254 --> 00:06:13.992
but to dream up entirely new ways

00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:15.709
for people to interact with

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.451
and experience music.

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.495
Thank you.

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:23.495
(Applause)
