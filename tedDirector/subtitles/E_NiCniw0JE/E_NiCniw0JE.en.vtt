00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.096
When I moved to Harare in 1985,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.896
social justice was at the core
of Zimbabwe's national health policy.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.616
The new government emerged
from a long war of independence

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.456
and immediately proclaimed
a socialist agenda:

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.856
health care services, primary education

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.736
became essentially free.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.616
A massive expansion
of rural health centers

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.336
placed roughly 80 percent
of the population

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.536
less than a two-hour walk
from these facilities,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.336
a truly remarkable accomplishment.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.016
In 1980, the year of independence,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.216
25 percent of Zimbabwean children
were fully immunized.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.536
By 1990, a mere decade later,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280
this proportion stood at 80 percent.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.096
I felt tremendously privileged
to be part of this transformation,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.576
a revolution.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.440
The excitement,
the camaraderie, was palpable.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.456
Working side by side
with brilliant Zimbabweans --

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.416
scientists, doctors, activists --

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.416
I felt connected not only
to an African independence movement,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.920
but to a global progressive
public health movement.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.016
But there were daunting challenges.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.616
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case
in 1985, the year I arrived.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.416
I had taken care of a few patients
with AIDS in the early 1980s,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.960
when I did my medical training
at Harlem Hospital, but --

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.760
we had no idea
what lay in store for Africa.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.336
Infection rate stood at about
two percent in my early days there.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.176
These would soar

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.576
to one out of every four adults

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.040
by the time I left Harare 17 years later.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.216
By the mid-1990s,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.376
I'd told hundreds of people
in the prime of life

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.616
that they were HIV-positive.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.736
I saw colleagues and friends die,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.760
my students, hospital patients, die.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.136
In response, my colleagues and I
set up a clinic.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.696
We did condom demonstrations.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.136
We launched school education
and workplace interventions.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.736
We did research. We counseled
the partners of infected men

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.376
about how to protect themselves.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.936
We worked hard, and at the time,
I believed that I was doing my best.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.056
I was providing excellent treatment,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.280
such as it was.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.000
But I was not talking
about structural change.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.376
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan
has spoken candidly

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.456
about his personal failure

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.336
leading to the Rwandan genocide.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.416
In 1994, he was head
of the UN peacekeeping department.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.976
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.056
he reflected, "I believed at the time
I was doing my best,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.976
but I realized after the genocide

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.960
that there was more
I could and should have done

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.240
to sound the alarm and rally support."

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.440
The AIDS epidemic caught
the health community unprepared,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.496
and today, when the World
Health Organization estimates

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.856
that 39 million people
have lost their lives to this disease,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.976
I'm not alone in feeling
remorse and regret

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.480
at not having done more earlier.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.016
But while living in Zimbabwe,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.736
I didn't see my role
as an advocacy or a political one.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.696
I was there for my technical skills,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.176
both my clinical and my research
epidemiology skills.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.176
And in my mind, my job
was to take care of patients

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.336
and to do research to better understand
the population patterns of transmission,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.080
and I hoped that we'd slow
the spread of the virus.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.696
I was aware that socially marginalized
populations were at disproportionate risk

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.736
of getting and dying of AIDS.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.816
And on the sugar plantations,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.616
which really more closely
resembled feudal fiefdoms

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.616
than any modern enterprise,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.296
60 percent of pregnant women

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.360
tested HIV-positive.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:36.176
I worked to show how getting infected
was not a moral failure

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.976
but instead related
to a culture of male superiority,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.536
to forced migrant labor
and to colonialism.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.360
Whites were largely unscathed.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.896
As health professionals,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.176
our tools were pitifully weak:

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.056
imploring people to change
their individual behaviors,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.936
use condoms, reduce number of partners.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.560
Infection rates climbed,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.176
and when treatment
became available in the West,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.616
treatment that remains
our most potent weapon

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.336
against this virus,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.736
it was unaffordable
to the public sector across Africa.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.000
I didn't speak out

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.176
about the unequal access
to these life-saving drugs

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.856
or about the underlying
economic and political systems

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.736
that were driving infection rates

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.960
in such huge swaths of the population.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.936
I rationalized my silence

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.896
by reminding myself
that I was a guest in the country,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.856
that sounding the alarm
could even get me kicked out,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.536
keep me from doing good work,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.056
taking care of my patients,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.840
doing much-needed research.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.896
So I didn't speak out

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.040
about the government's
early stance on AIDS.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.616
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.816
Many doctors, health professionals,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.720
may think I did nothing wrong.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.536
Our pact with our patients,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.296
the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.280
is about the sanctity
of the patient-doctor relationship.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.680
And I did everything I could

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.240
for each and every patient of mine.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.376
But I knew

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.136
that epidemics emerge
along the fissures of our society,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.176
reflecting not only biology,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.816
but more importantly
patterns of marginalization, exclusion,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.000
discrimination related to race,
gender, sexuality, class and more.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.320
It was true of AIDS.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.520
It was true just recently of Ebola.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.416
Medical anthropologists
such as Paul Farmer,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.376
who worked on AIDS in Haiti,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.800
call this structural violence:

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.536
structural because inequities are embedded

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.536
in the political and economic
organization of our social world,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.920
often in ways that are invisible
to those with privilege and power;

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.496
and violence because its impact --

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.960
premature deaths,
suffering, illness -- is violent.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.016
We do little for our patients

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.896
if we fail to recognize

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.856
these social injustices.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.216
Sounding the alarm is the first step
towards doing public health right,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.296
and it's how we may rally support

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.400
to break through
and create real change together.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.480
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.016
I'm speaking up about a lot of things,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.696
even when it makes listeners
uncomfortable,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.640
even when it makes me uncomfortable.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.456
And a lot of this
is about racial disparities

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.440
and institutionalized racism,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.776
things that we're not supposed
to have in this country anymore,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.136
certainly not in the practice of medicine

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.376
or public health.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.600
But we have them,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.480
and we pay for them in lives cut short.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.976
That's why sounding the alarm

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.776
about the impact of racism on health
in the United States,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.096
the ongoing institutional
and interpersonal violence

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.096
that people of color face,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.456
compounded by our tragic legacy

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.400
of 250 years of slavery,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.240
90 years of Jim Crow

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.696
and 60 years of imperfect equality,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.096
sounding the alarm about this

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.456
is central to doing my job right

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.919
as New York City's Health Commissioner.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.376
In New York City, premature mortality --
that's death before the age of 65 --

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.176
is 50 percent higher
for black men than white ones.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.016
A black woman in 2012

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.776
faced more than 10 times
the risk of dying related to childbirth

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.120
as a white woman.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.896
And though we've made enormous strides

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.976
in reducing infant mortality rates,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.536
a black baby still faces

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.120
nearly three times the risk
of death in its first year of life

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.680
as compared to a white baby.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.760
New York City's not exceptional.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.096
These statistics are paralleled

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.320
by statistics found
across the United States.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.496
A recent New York Times analysis

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.320
reported that there are 1.5 million
missing black men across the country.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.720
They noted that more than one

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.896
out of every six black men

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.216
who today should be
between the ages of 25 and 54 years

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.160
have disappeared from daily life,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.560
lost either to prison or premature death.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.376
There is great injustice

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.376
in the daily and disproportionate violence
faced by young black men,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.480
the focus of recent protests
under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.736
But we have to remember

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.176
that enduring and disparate rates

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.136
and the occurrence and outcome
of common medical conditions --

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.296
heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV --

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.576
diseases that may kill slowly and quietly

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.840
and take even more
black lives prematurely.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.736
As the #BlackLivesMatter
movement unfolded,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.296
I felt frustrated and angry

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.616
that the medical community

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.096
has been reluctant
to even use the word "racism"

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.816
in our research and our work.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.720
You've probably felt something
every time I've said it.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.776
Our medical students
held die-ins in their white coats,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.816
but the medical community
has largely stood by passively

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.256
as ongoing discrimination
continues to affect

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.096
the disease profile and mortality.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.896
And I worry

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.456
that the trend towards personalized
and precision medicine,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.656
looking for biological or genetic targets
to better tailor treatment,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.696
may inadvertently cause us
to lose sight of the big picture,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.216
that it is the daily context,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.936
where a person lives, grows,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.416
works, loves,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.336
that most importantly
determines population health,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.000
and for too many of us, poor health.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.280
As health professionals in our daily work,

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.736
whether in the clinic or doing research,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.280
we are witness to great injustice:

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.936
the homeless person
who is unable to follow medical advice

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.376
because he has more pressing priorities;

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.136
the transgender youth
who is contemplating suicide

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.776
because our society is just so harsh;

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.856
the single mother who has been made
to feel that she is responsible

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.440
for the poor health of her child.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.376
Our role as health professionals

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.560
is not just to treat our patients

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.720
but to sound the alarm

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.400
and advocate for change.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.576
Rightfully or not,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.576
our societal position
gives our voices great credibility,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.080
and we shouldn't waste that.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.040
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.936
and I've promised myself

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.576
that as New York City's
Health Commissioner,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.896
I will use every opportunity I have

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.776
to sound the alarm

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.256
and rally support for health equity.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.056
I will speak out against racism,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.216
and I hope you will join me,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.576
and I will join you
when you speak out against sexism

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.856
or any other form of inequality.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.296
It's time for us to rise up

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.016
and collectively speak up

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.600
about structural inequality.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.936
We don't have to have all the answers

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.560
to call for change.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.440
We just need courage.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.560
The health of our patients,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.160
the health of us all, depends on it.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.480
(Applause)
