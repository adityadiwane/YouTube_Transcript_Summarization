00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.244
To most of you, this is a device

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:22.252
to buy, sell, play games,

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:24.162
watch videos.

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.302
I think it might be a lifeline.

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.718
I think actually it might be able to save more lives

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:30.218
than penicillin.

00:00:30.218 --> 00:00:31.691
Texting:

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:34.510
I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.760
a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see --

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.385
hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else --

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.177
or trying to translate the abbreviations

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:45.135
LOL, LMAO, HMU.

00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:46.968
I can help you with those later.

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:49.010
But the parents in the room

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.635
know that texting is actually

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:53.260
the best way to communicate with your kids.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.093
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids.

00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:57.760
(Laughter)

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.385
The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month,

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:05.885
unless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.468
And the secret is she opens every single one.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:13.177
Texting has a 100 percent open rate.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:14.593
Now the parents are really alarmed.

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:16.427
It's a 100 percent open rate

00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:18.177
even if she doesn't respond to you

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.927
when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner.

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:21.468
I promise she read that text.

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:27.552
And this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:28.927
Texting actually overindexes

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.010
for minority and urban youth.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.885
I know this because at DoSomething.org,

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.593
which is the largest organization

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:38.552
for teenagers and social change in America,

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.010
about six months ago we pivoted

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.635
and started focusing on text messaging.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:45.843
We're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:48.552
about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:51.718
or to work on homeless issues and things like that.

00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:55.135
We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:02:01.218
We've also found an unintended consequence.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.260
We've been getting text messages back like these.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.510
"I don't want to go to school today.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.385
The boys call me faggot."

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:13.968
"I was cutting, my parents found out,

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.843
and so I stopped.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:18.052
But I just started again an hour ago."

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:21.343
Or, "He won't stop raping me.

00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:22.718
He told me not to tell anyone.

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:25.510
It's my dad. Are you there?"

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.635
That last one's an actual text message that we received.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:31.385
And yeah, we're there.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.927
I will not forget the day we got that text message.

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:36.343
And so it was that day that we decided

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:39.468
we needed to build a crisis text hotline.

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:40.968
Because this isn't what we do.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:42.302
We do social change.

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.302
Kids are just sending us these text messages

00:02:44.302 --> 00:02:47.218
because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:49.010
and there's nowhere else to turn

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.593
that they're sending them to us.

00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:53.885
So think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:55.593
It's fast, it's pretty private.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:59.010
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.052
It's real time.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:04.214
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals.

00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:06.468
That's great.

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:10.885
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data.

00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:13.385
Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.135
with counseling and referrals.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.635
I want to prevent this shit from happening.

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:21.968
So think about a cop.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.718
There's something in New York City.

00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:26.260
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.843
And then they started crime mapping.

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:31.218
And so they started following and watching

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.260
petty thefts, summonses, all kinds of things --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.010
charting the future essentially.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.718
And they found things like,

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.343
when you see crystal meth on the street,

00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:41.968
if you add police presence,

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:45.093
you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate

00:03:45.093 --> 00:03:48.677
of assaults and robberies that would happen.

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:49.802
In fact, the year after

00:03:49.802 --> 00:03:52.427
the NYPD put CompStat in place,

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:55.593
the murder rate fell 60 percent.

00:03:55.593 --> 00:04:00.135
So think about the data from a crisis text line.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.510
There is no census on bullying and dating abuse

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.427
and eating disorders and cutting and rape --

00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:08.177
no census.

00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:10.510
Maybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.135
that cost lots of money and took lots of time.

00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:15.510
Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.510
Imagine having real time data

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.177
on every one of those issues.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.968
You could inform legislation.

00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:23.760
You could inform school policy.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.843
You could say to a principal,

00:04:25.843 --> 00:04:28.635
"You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.593
What's going on in your school?"

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:33.135
You could see the immediate impact of legislation

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:35.427
or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly

00:04:35.427 --> 00:04:38.968
and see what happens as a result.

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.635
This is really, to me,

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:44.010
the power of texting and the power of data.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.260
Because while people are talking about data,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.843
making it possible for Facebook

00:04:47.843 --> 00:04:50.093
to mine my friend from the third grade,

00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:53.052
or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers,

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:56.052
or some dude to build a better baseball team,

00:04:56.052 --> 00:05:01.218
I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.343
to help that kid go to school,

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:05.427
to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom

00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:09.343
and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:12.135
Thank you.

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:16.885
(Applause)
