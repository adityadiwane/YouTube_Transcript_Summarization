00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
won't interest many other people.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
I would love to talk about my astronomy,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
in non-gray atmospheres

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
So I'm not going to talk about that.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
(Laughter)

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
It would be just as much fun

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And I caught the guys,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and stealing information and selling it.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
but, 20 years later ...

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
It's tedious.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160
I'm --

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
The first time you do something, it's science.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
The second time, it's engineering.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
A third time, it's just being a technician.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So, I'm not going to talk about that.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
nor am I going to talk about

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
that we have to bring more computers into schools.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
My idea is: no! No!

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
And I'd love to talk about this,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
that it doesn't need much talking about --

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and everything else that I've said.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
So don't go back and read my dissertation.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
It probably has lies in it as well.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
(Laughter)

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And if you look at it over here,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.160
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
because I've got gray hair,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.160
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
if you really want to know about the future,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
ask a kindergarten teacher.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
They know.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
ask an experienced one.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
I don't. Nor, I suspect,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160
that are going to be there.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
But to me, things aren't the future.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.160
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.160
but have never gone bowling together?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
Change is happening, and the change that is happening

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
is not one that is in software.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.160
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
is right over here. Right over here.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
I would dearly love to talk about

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
things that have one side.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
but I'm one of the very few people,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
This is a Klein bottle.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
For those of you in the audience who know,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
It has wonderful properties.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And I'd love to talk to you about this,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
(Laughter)

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160
(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.160
However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
Just two weeks ago I made --

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.160
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
But what I've just made --

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
which, although in four dimensions

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
it's perfectly capable of doing so

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
it can hold fluids.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160
That was a month of my life.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.160
(Laughter)

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.160
Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
who passed away last summer.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Could somebody put this guy up?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And I looked over her album

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
As a technician, repairing and maintaining

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And it sent me back.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
This guy over here of course is me.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
This man is Robert Moog,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
who passed away this past August.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.160
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.160
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
Mentoring me. He'd come up and

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
spend hours and hours with me.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
In the background, my bicycle.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
stuff like this.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
(Applause)

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.160
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.160
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
I've decided that, for me at least,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
I don't have a big enough head.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
So I think locally and I act locally.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.160
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.160
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
I was talking about this stuff to

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
some schoolteachers about a year ago.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Put your money where you mouth is."

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.160
Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Not just showing up every now and then.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.160
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
I take lunch hour. (Applause)

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
Not just show up to class every now and then.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
One of the things that I've done for my science students

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
No calculus, I'll cut out that.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
You won't need to know trig.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
and we're going to do serious experiments.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
We're going to be doing genuine physics."

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
(High-pitched tone)

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Oh, before I even turn that on,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
was to measure the speed of light.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160
measured the speed of light.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.160
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
who have measured the speed of light?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
and measure the speed of light.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And there's no time to do it.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.160
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
And all of you know the wave equation is

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:51.160
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
over here, that's what's interesting --

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
pitch goes down, things stretch out.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Right? This is simple physics.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
but they should have, and I wish they had,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
or light, you get a constant.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And that constant is the speed of sound.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
I've got a frequency counter right here.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
Now, so I know the frequency.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.160
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
All I need now is to flip on another beam,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.160
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
you'll notice the spiral.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.160
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
coming out this way.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
but bear with me. (Laughter)

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
To measure the wavelength,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
one full wave -- over to here.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:52.160
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.160
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:16.160
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Let's figure out what this is.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:32.160
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:40.160
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.160
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160
not bad. Pretty good.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.160
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.160
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:27.160
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
There's a riot going on on campus,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
and the police are chasing me, right?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
"You! You're a student."

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.160
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
This cop comes after me with a rifle.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
He wants to clunk me over the head!

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160
The cop's chasing me.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Chases me into this room.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
The entranceway to the bell tower.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
I slam the door behind me, climb up,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
I keep climbing up, go back.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.160
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
that you climb up this wooden ladder.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.160
Namely, that when they cast bells,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
they write inscriptions on them.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.160
So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.160
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
"All truth is one.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.160
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.160
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.160
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:40.160
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
Thank you very much.
