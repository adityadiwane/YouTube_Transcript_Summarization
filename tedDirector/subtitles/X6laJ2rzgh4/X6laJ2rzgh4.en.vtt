00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.466
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:30.092
and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:34.297
The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way

00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:37.443
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:41.066
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.779
and photographers were telling us another.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:48.323
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.

00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:52.484
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:57.128
They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.

00:00:57.128 --> 00:01:00.746
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:04.639
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.927
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:11.678
It puts a human face on issues which, from afar,

00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:17.085
can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:21.730
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.152
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:27.475
And I understood that documentary photography

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:31.965
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:36.013
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:41.498
My TED wish. Thereâ€™s a vital story that needs to be told

00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:45.105
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.689
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.938
to use news photography in the digital era.

00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:54.831
