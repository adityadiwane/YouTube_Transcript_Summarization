00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
these are the dancing bears.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
to try and find out what was going on.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
because of this.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
who live across India,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and have been in India since the 13th century.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
We went about getting evidence of what was going on.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and being sold and traded.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and they are used for bear paw soup,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and also being trained, later on,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
The couple are barely 18 years old.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
we found that it's an illegal act.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
if they were caught by authorities.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
It was unacceptable.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
The mother bears are usually killed.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
for a livelihood, to getting something else.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And we were so unsure that this would work.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
He has a telephone booth.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And then it started, there was no turning back after that.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
near Agra.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Then there was no looking back at all for us.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
We gave cycle rickshaws.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
We set up carpet-weaving units,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
vocational training for the women.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Education. The kids never went to school.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And they were never allowed to go to school

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Of course we also had to get the bears in.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
This is what happens to the bears when they come in.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And this is what we turn them into.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
So, basically in 2002 there were

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
1,200 dancing bears.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
The big news that I want to announce today

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
is that next month we will be bringing in

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
the very last bear of India,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
into our rescue center.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
(Applause)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
which has been here for centuries.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And the people can hold their heads up high.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that they've lived all their lives.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And there will be no more removing of these bears.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And the children, both humans and bear cubs

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
can live peacefully. Thank you.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.260
(Applause)
