00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:14.275
My job at Twitter

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.253
is to ensure user trust,

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:19.090
protect user rights and keep users safe,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.350
both from each other

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.249
and, at times, from themselves.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.524
Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:31.394
Back in January 2009,

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:34.725
we saw more than two million new tweets each day

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.489
on the platform.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.397
January 2014, more than 500 million.

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.889
We were seeing two million tweets

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:47.065
in less than six minutes.

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:54.049
That's a 24,900-percent increase.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.302
Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.805
puts no one in harm's way.

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.740
There's no risk involved.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.493
My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:08.466
Sounds straightforward, right?

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.618
You might even think it'd be easy,

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:11.788
given that I just said the vast majority

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:15.598
of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.

00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:17.767
Why spend so much time

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.510
searching for potential calamities

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.410
in innocuous activities?

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.350
Given the scale that Twitter is at,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.707
a one-in-a-million chance happens

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:33.583
500 times a day.

00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:35.028
It's the same for other companies

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.499
dealing at this sort of scale.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.207
For us, edge cases,

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:41.832
those rare situations that are unlikely to occur,

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:44.454
are more like norms.

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:48.396
Say 99.999 percent of tweets

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.284
pose no risk to anyone.

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:51.350
There's no threat involved.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.304
Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks

00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:56.267
like Australia's Heart Reef,

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.188
or tweeting about a concert they're attending,

00:01:59.188 --> 00:02:03.935
or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:08.444
After you take out that 99.999 percent,

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:11.973
that tiny percentage of tweets remaining

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.362
works out to roughly

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:17.837
150,000 per month.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.293
The sheer scale of what we're dealing with

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:22.605
makes for a challenge.

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:23.783
You know what else makes my role

00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:26.890
particularly challenging?

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.013
People do weird things.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:33.842
(Laughter)

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:36.233
And I have to figure out what they're doing,

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:38.482
why, and whether or not there's risk involved,

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:40.650
often without much in terms of context

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.497
or background.

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:44.574
I'm going to show you some examples

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:46.579
that I've run into during my time at Twitter --

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.199
these are all real examples â€”

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.852
of situations that at first seemed cut and dried,

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:52.495
but the truth of the matter was something

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:54.045
altogether different.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.022
The details have been changed

00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:57.279
to protect the innocent

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.512
and sometimes the guilty.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.517
We'll start off easy.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.310
["Yo bitch"]

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.538
If you saw a Tweet that only said this,

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.232
you might think to yourself,

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.885
"That looks like abuse."

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:14.992
After all, why would you
want to receive the message,

00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:17.210
"Yo, bitch."

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.873
Now, I try to stay relatively hip

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:24.385
to the latest trends and memes,

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:27.089
so I knew that "yo, bitch"

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.243
was also often a common greeting between friends,

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:34.505
as well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.992
I will admit that I did not expect

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:39.833
to encounter a fourth use case.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.937
It turns out it is also used on Twitter

00:03:42.937 --> 00:03:45.999
when people are role-playing as dogs.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:51.278
(Laughter)

00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:52.944
And in fact, in that case,

00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:54.553
it's not only not abusive,

00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:57.692
it's technically just an accurate greeting.

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.581
(Laughter)

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.652
So okay, determining whether or not

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:04.500
something is abusive without context,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.092
definitely hard.

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:08.809
Let's look at spam.

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.769
Here's an example of an account engaged

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.437
in classic spammer behavior,

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:13.996
sending the exact same message

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:15.800
to thousands of people.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.593
While this is a mockup I put
together using my account,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:21.594
we see accounts doing this all the time.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.573
Seems pretty straightforward.

00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:25.626
We should just automatically suspend accounts

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:28.933
engaging in this kind of behavior.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:32.143
Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:35.026
Turns out that that message
could also be a notification

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:38.915
you signed up for that the International
Space Station is passing overhead

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:40.761
because you wanted to go outside

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.709
and see if you could see it.

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:43.934
You're not going to get that chance

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.781
if we mistakenly suspend the account

00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:48.047
thinking it's spam.

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:51.573
Okay. Let's make the stakes higher.

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:53.489
Back to my account,

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:56.994
again exhibiting classic behavior.

00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:59.637
This time it's sending the same message and link.

00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:02.411
This is often indicative of 
something called phishing,

00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:05.589
somebody trying to steal another
person's account information

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.792
by directing them to another website.

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:11.986
That's pretty clearly not a good thing.

00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:13.916
We want to, and do, suspend accounts

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:16.540
engaging in that kind of behavior.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.787
So why are the stakes higher for this?

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:22.786
Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.696
who managed to record a video

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:27.966
of a police officer beating a non-violent protester

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:30.941
who's trying to let the world know what's happening.

00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:32.584
We don't want to gamble

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:35.101
on potentially silencing that crucial speech

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.030
by classifying it as spam and suspending it.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.909
That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.597
when looking at account behaviors,

00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:44.613
and even then, we can still get it wrong

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:46.849
and have to reevaluate.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.557
Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against,

00:05:50.557 --> 00:05:53.253
it's crucial that I not only predict

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:57.037
but also design protections for the unexpected.

00:05:57.037 --> 00:05:59.379
And that's not just an issue for me,

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.466
or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:03.872
It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:05.797
something that you think is going to be amazing

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:08.586
and will let people do awesome things.

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:11.452
So what do I do?

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:14.770
I pause and I think,

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.865
how could all of this

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:20.658
go horribly wrong?

00:06:20.658 --> 00:06:25.111
I visualize catastrophe.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:27.574
And that's hard. There's a sort of

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.422
inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that,

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:32.234
like when you're writing your wedding vows

00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:34.880
at the same time as your prenuptial agreement.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.576
(Laughter)

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:38.949
But you still have to do it,

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.395
particularly if you're marrying 
500 million tweets per day.

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:46.492
What do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?"

00:06:46.492 --> 00:06:49.254
I try to think of how something as

00:06:49.254 --> 00:06:52.482
benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat

00:06:52.482 --> 00:06:53.586
could lead to death,

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:55.912
and what to do to prevent that.

00:06:55.912 --> 00:06:58.295
Which happens to be my next example.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:01.405
This is my cat, Eli.

00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:03.386
We wanted to give users the ability

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:05.459
to add photos to their tweets.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:07.056
A picture is worth a thousand words.

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:09.065
You only get 140 characters.

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:10.265
You add a photo to your tweet,

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:13.303
look at how much more content you've got now.

00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:14.980
There's all sorts of great things you can do

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.987
by adding a photo to a tweet.

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:19.267
My job isn't to think of those.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:22.014
It's to think of what could go wrong.

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.906
How could this picture

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:27.445
lead to my death?

00:07:27.445 --> 00:07:30.605
Well, here's one possibility.

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:33.691
There's more in that picture than just a cat.

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:35.783
There's geodata.

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:37.995
When you take a picture with your smartphone

00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:39.294
or digital camera,

00:07:39.294 --> 00:07:40.948
there's a lot of additional information

00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:42.564
saved along in that image.

00:07:42.564 --> 00:07:44.496
In fact, this image also contains

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.301
the equivalent of this,

00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:49.380
more specifically, this.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.336
Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.621
to track me down and do me harm

00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:55.405
based upon image data associated

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:57.353
with a picture I took of my cat,

00:07:57.353 --> 00:08:01.004
but I start by assuming the worst will happen.

00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:03.342
That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter,

00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:07.163
we made the decision to strip that geodata out.

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:13.010
(Applause)

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.623
If I start by assuming the worst

00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:16.570
and work backwards,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.123
I can make sure that the protections we build

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.891
work for both expected

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:22.969
and unexpected use cases.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.914
Given that I spend my days and nights

00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:28.455
imagining the worst that could happen,

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:32.712
it wouldn't be surprising if 
my worldview was gloomy.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.495
(Laughter)

00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:35.912
It's not.

00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:39.788
The vast majority of interactions I see --

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:43.689
and I see a lot, believe me -- are positive,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.613
people reaching out to help

00:08:45.613 --> 00:08:49.061
or to connect or share information with each other.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.384
It's just that for those of us dealing with scale,

00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:56.184
for those of us tasked with keeping people safe,

00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:58.730
we have to assume the worst will happen,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.957
because for us, a one-in-a-million chance

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:05.706
is pretty good odds.

00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:07.570
Thank you.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.570
(Applause)
