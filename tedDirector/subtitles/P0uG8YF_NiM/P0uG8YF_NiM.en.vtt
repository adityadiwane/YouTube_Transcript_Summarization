00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Applause)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Music)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
♫ between two worlds. ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
♫ Standing at the center of time ♫

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ as it uncurls. ♫

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
♫ Moving beyond past conclusions. ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ Searching for the future ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ Trying to see the world ♫

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ They say nothing lasts forever, ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
♫ The Romans, the Spanish ♫

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
♫ American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ♫

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ imposing its will ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
♫ and ruling by force ♫

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ on and on through time. ♫

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ And the world can't take it ♫

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ very much longer. ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Applause)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Thank you.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Applause)
