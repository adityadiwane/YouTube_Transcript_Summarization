00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
over the past six million years.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
All right.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We all have come from a long way,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I say that not because I am African,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
for human ancestors, upright walking traces,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
All right.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to tell you a story of all of us.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You don't need to remember that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
After I was invited by TED, I did some digging,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because that's what we do, to know about my host.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You don't just jump into an invitation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I learned that the first technology appeared

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I think knowing this is a very useful context

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
within which we can think of our ancestry.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
However, DNA analysis informs us only about

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the beginning and the end, telling us nothing

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
about what happened in the middle.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and see the different stages of development.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Laughter) --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
how we looked like and how we behaved at different times,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That then gives you an access

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to explore the biological mechanisms

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and forces that are responsible for this gradual change

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that made us what we are today.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's a systematic and scientific approach,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When you get there, this is what you see,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
(Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And you find nothing for years and years.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But what you find are not the human remains,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
But you could ask, how could these large mammals

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
live in this desert environment?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that the environment and the carrying capacity

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
of this region was drastically different from what we have today.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And our ancestors lived in that game park,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but were just the minorities. They were not as successful

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
You either don't know what you're looking for,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and the people were scared and went somewhere else.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Let's go somewhere else."

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and you see the face here covered by sandstone.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And here is actually the spinal column

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
because she was buried by a river.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
What you have here seems to be nothing,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
but contains an incredible amount of scientific information

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that helps us explore what makes us human.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
ever found in the history of paleoanthropology,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
an amazing piece of our long, long history.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that's why I am not in.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but you are in the middle of nowhere?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of making sure everything is safe.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
preparation and description, which was very long,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I just showed you in the previous slide.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It took five years.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
but the labor was very long.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
even a minister.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Laughter)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We were able to tell that she belonged

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to the human family tree because the legs, the foot,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and some features clearly showed that she walked upright,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But in addition, if you compare the skull

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
you see that you have vertical forehead.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And you see that in humans, because of the development

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You don't see that in chimpanzees,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and you don't see this very projecting canine.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you do detailed analysis, and we know now

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
that she belongs to the Lucy species,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
known as Australopithecus afarensis.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The next exciting question is, girl or boy?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And how old was she when she died?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You can determine the sex of the individual

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
based on the size of the teeth.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
How?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
called sexual dimorphism, which simply means

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
males are larger than females and males have larger teeth

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
than the females.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
which you don't see here, because what you have here

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
are the baby teeth.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But using the CT scanning technology,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
which is normally used for medical purposes,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
showing you both the baby teeth here

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and the still-growing adult teeth here.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So when you measure those teeth,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
it was clear that she turned out to be a girl

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
with very small canine teeth.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So, this girl died when she was about three,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
3.3 million years ago.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So, with all that information, the big question is --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
what do we actually -- what does she tell us?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
To answer this question, we can phrase another question.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
What do we actually know about our ancestors?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
how they walked around,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and how they lived and grew up.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
are included: first, this skeleton documents,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And second, she tells us that she walked upright,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
but had some adaptation for tree climbing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And more interesting, however,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is the brain in this child was still growing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
At age three, if you have a still-growing brain,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
it's a human behavior.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
That's why they can cope with their environment

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That's why we need care from our parents.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But that care means also you learn.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You spend more time with your parents.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
which is this extended dependence of human children

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
on their family or parents.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, the still-growing brain in this individual

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
tells us that childhood, which requires

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
an incredible social organization,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
a very complex social organization,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
emerged over three million years ago.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
on what makes us human.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But not everything was human, and I will give you

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
a very exciting example.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It supports your tongue from behind.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's, in a way, your voice box.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It determines the type of voice you produce.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It was not known in the fossil record,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and we have it in this skeleton.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What does that tell us?"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You know, that is very exciting for us,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and that evolution is in the making.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
To summarize the significance of this fossil,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
we can say the following.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
came essentially from adult individuals

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They don't preserve well, as you know.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
on how they looked like, how they behaved,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
was kind of biased toward adults.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Imagine somebody coming from Mars

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and his job is to report on the type of people

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the children, and he goes back and reports.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
That's what somehow we were doing so far

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
in the absence of the fossil children,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So, I think the most important question at the end is,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
what do we actually learn from specimens like this

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and from our past in general?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
of scientific information as to what makes us human,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you know, the many human ancestors that have existed

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
that we, Homo sapiens, have today.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But if this species, ancient species,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
would travel in time and see us today,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
they would very much be very proud of their legacy,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
because they became the ancestors of

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the most successful species in the universe.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but they did great.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And can we really do better than these primitive,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
small-brained ancestors?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Among the most pressing challenges that our species

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to talk about this.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
carrying guns, that depends on other people forever,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
or to promote an Africa which is confident,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and great values at the same time.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
That's because we Africans concentrate --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I am from Ethiopia, by the way --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
we concentrate too much on how we are seen

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
from elsewhere, or from outside.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I think it's important to promote in a more positive way

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
on how we see ourselves.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
That's what I call positive African attitude.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So finally, I would like to say,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
so let's help Africa walk upright and forward,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Thank you.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
(Applause)
