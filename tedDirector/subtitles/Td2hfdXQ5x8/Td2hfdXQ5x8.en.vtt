00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:15.518
Let me tell you a story

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:18.724
about a little girl named Naghma.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:20.546
Naghma lived in a refugee camp

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:23.425
with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.361
Every morning, her father would wake up

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.801
in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:31.367
and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.755
The winter was very harsh,

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:35.439
and unfortunately, Naghma's brother died

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:37.359
and her mother became very ill.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.939
In desperation, her father went to a neighbor

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.336
to borrow 2,500 dollars.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:44.250
After several months of waiting,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.767
the neighbor became very impatient,

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.485
and he demanded that he be paid back.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.929
Unfortunately, Naghma's
father didn't have the money,

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.764
and so the two men agreed to a jirga.

00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:56.294
So simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:59.534
that's used in Afghanistan's 
informal justice system.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:02.988
It's usually presided over by religious leaders

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:04.686
and village elders,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:07.886
and jirgas are often used in
rural countries like Afghanistan,

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:09.737
where there's deep-seated resentment

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.999
against the formal system.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.337
At the jirga, the men sat together

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:17.251
and they decided that the 
best way to satisfy the debt

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:21.840
would be if Naghma married
the neighbor's 21-year-old son.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.500
She was six.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.565
Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.253
are all too common,

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:29.748
and from the comforts of our home,

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:31.503
we may look at these stories as another

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.763
crushing blow to women's rights.

00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:36.294
And if you watched Afghanistan on the news,

00:01:36.294 --> 00:01:39.993
you may have this view that it's a failed state.

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:43.809
However, Afghanistan does have a legal system,

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:47.671
and while jirgas are built on
long-standing tribal customs,

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.034
even in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.962
and it goes without saying

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:55.583
that giving a child to satisfy a debt

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:59.649
is not only grossly immoral, it's illegal.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.176
In 2008, I went to Afghanistan

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.496
for a justice funded program,

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:07.203
and I went there originally 
on this nine-month program

00:02:07.203 --> 00:02:09.115
to train Afghan lawyers.

00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:11.376
In that nine months, I went around the country

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:14.312
and I talked to hundreds of
people that were locked up,

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:15.910
and I talked to many businesses

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.440
that were also operating in Afghanistan.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.784
And within these conversations,

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:21.655
I started hearing the connections

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.645
between the businesses and the people,

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.715
and how laws that were meant to protect them

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.416
were being underused,

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:31.474
while gross and illegal punitive
measures were overused.

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:34.298
And so this put me on a quest for justness,

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:37.020
and what justness means to me

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.715
is using laws for their intended purpose,

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.040
which is to protect.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.543
The role of laws is to protect.

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:50.258
So as a result, I decided to 
open up a private practice,

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:52.599
and I became the first foreigner to litigate

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.815
in Afghan courts.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:57.672
Throughout this time, I also studied many laws,

00:02:57.672 --> 00:02:59.202
I talked to many people,

00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:00.373
I read up on many cases,

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:02.763
and I found that the lack of justness

00:03:02.763 --> 00:03:04.749
is not just a problem in Afghanistan,

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.070
but it's a global problem.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.821
And while I originally shied away from

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.938
representing human rights cases

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:13.117
because I was really concerned about how it would

00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:15.760
affect me both professionally and personally,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.513
I decided that the need for justness was so great

00:03:18.513 --> 00:03:20.384
that I couldn't continue to ignore it.

00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:22.701
And so I started representing people like Naghma

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:25.157
pro bono also.

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:26.863
Now, since I've been in Afghanistan

00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:29.326
and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:33.040
I've represented from CEOs 
of Fortune 500 companies

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.368
to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,

00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:36.918
and with much success.

00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:39.833
And the reason for my success is very simple:

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.843
I work the system from the inside out

00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:43.262
and use the laws in the ways

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:45.998
that they're intended to be used.

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:48.120
I find that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.536
achieving justness in places like Afghanistan

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:53.684
is difficult, and there's three reasons.

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:56.240
The first reason is that simply put,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.339
people are very uneducated as
to what their legal rights were,

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.930
and I find that this is a global problem.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.144
The second issue

00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:06.583
is that even with laws on the books,

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.848
it's often superseded or ignored

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.170
by tribal customs, like in the first jirga

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.702
that sold Naghma off.

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:15.404
And the third problem with achieving justness

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:18.216
is that even with good, existing laws on the books,

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.862
there aren't people or lawyers 
that are willing to fight

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:22.558
for those laws.

00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:25.432
And that's what I do: I use existing laws,

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.231
often unused laws,

00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:30.865
and I work those to the benefits of my clients.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.413
We all need to create a global culture

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:35.241
of human rights

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.990
and be investors in a global 
human rights economy,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.757
and by working in this mindset,

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:42.474
we can significantly improve justice globally.

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:44.866
Now let's get back to Naghma.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:47.265
Several people heard about this story,

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:48.790
and so they contacted me because they wanted

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.355
to pay the $2,500 debt.

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.216
And it's not just that simple;

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:54.998
you can't just throw money at this problem

00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:56.151
and think that it's going to disappear.

00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:58.632
That's not how it works in Afghanistan.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:02.030
So I told them I'd get involved,

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.318
but in order to get involved, 
what needed to happen

00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:07.141
is a second jirga needed to be called,

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.250
a jirga of appeals.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.501
And so in order for that to happen,

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.206
we needed to get the village elders together,

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:16.467
we needed to get the tribal leaders together,

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:18.056
the religious leaders.

00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:19.630
Naghma's father needed to agree,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.881
the neighbor needed to agree,

00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.085
and also his son needed to agree.

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:27.110
And I thought, if I'm going to 
get involved in this thing,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.765
then they also need to agree 
that I preside over it.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:33.735
So, after hours of talking

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:34.943
and tracking them down,

00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:37.806
and about 30 cups of tea,

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:39.718
they finally agreed that we could sit down

00:05:39.718 --> 00:05:43.050
for a second jirga, and we did.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.134
And what was different about the second jirga

00:05:45.134 --> 00:05:47.709
is this time, we put the law at the center of it,

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.053
and it was very important for me

00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:50.811
that they all understood that Naghma

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:53.150
had a right to be protected.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.696
And at the end of this jirga,

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.989
it was ordered by the judge

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.825
that the first decision was erased,

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:04.257
and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:06.090
and we all signed a written order

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.481
where all the men acknowledged

00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.601
that what they did was illegal,

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:14.399
and if they did it again, that 
they would go to prison.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.168
Most —

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:17.636
(Applause)

00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:19.483
Thanks.

00:06:19.483 --> 00:06:21.299
And most importantly,

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:22.800
the engagement was terminated

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.809
and Naghma was free.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.666
Protecting Naghma and her right to be free

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:30.300
protects us.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.762
Now, with my job, there's above-average

00:06:33.762 --> 00:06:36.505
amount of risks that are involved.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:39.212
I've been temporarily detained.

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:41.805
I've been accused of running a brothel,

00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:44.110
accused of being a spy.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.238
I've had a grenade thrown at my office.

00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.937
It didn't go off, though.

00:06:48.937 --> 00:06:50.537
But I find that with my job,

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:53.503
that the rewards far outweigh the risks,

00:06:53.503 --> 00:06:55.877
and as many risks as I take,

00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:57.846
my clients take far greater risks,

00:06:57.846 --> 00:06:59.349
because they have a lot more to lose

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.839
if their cases go unheard,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.962
or worse, if they're penalized
for having me as their lawyer.

00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:05.736
With every case that I take,

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.656
I realize that as much as
I'm standing behind my clients,

00:07:08.656 --> 00:07:10.669
that they're also standing behind me,

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.462
and that's what keeps me going.

00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:16.359
Law as a point of leverage

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.881
is crucial in protecting all of us.

00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:21.517
Journalists are very vital in making sure

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:24.791
that that information is given to the public.

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.277
Too often, we receive information from journalists

00:07:27.277 --> 00:07:30.921
but we forget how that information was given.

00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.507
This picture is a picture of the

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:35.500
British press corps in Afghanistan.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.649
It was taken a couple of years
ago by my friend David Gill.

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:40.517
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:43.363
since 2010, there have been 
thousands of journalists

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:45.241
who have been threatened, injured,

00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:47.873
killed, detained.

00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:50.112
Too often, when we get this information,

00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:51.336
we forget who it affects

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:54.634
or how that information is given to us.

00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:57.244
What many journalists do, 
both foreign and domestic,

00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:01.315
is very remarkable, especially
in places like Afghanistan,

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:02.887
and it's important that we never forget that,

00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:04.243
because what they're protecting

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:06.525
is not only our right to receive that information

00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:08.582
but also the freedom of the press, which is vital

00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:11.458
to a democratic society.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:15.343
Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.

00:08:15.343 --> 00:08:17.233
He works for The New York Times,

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:18.850
and unfortunately, a few months ago

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.990
he wrote an article that displeased

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.296
people in the government.

00:08:22.296 --> 00:08:25.546
As a result, he was temporarily detained

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:29.859
and he was illegally exiled out of the country.

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.911
I represent Matt,

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.039
and after dealing with the government,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.719
I was able to get legal acknowledgment

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.780
that in fact he was illegally exiled,

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.840
and that freedom of the
press does exist in Afghanistan,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.372
and there's consequences if that's not followed.

00:08:44.372 --> 00:08:46.118
And I'm happy to say that

00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:48.206
as of a few days ago,

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:49.532
the Afghan government

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:51.744
formally invited him back into the country

00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:55.377
and they reversed their exile order of him.

00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:59.016
(Applause)

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:03.252
If you censor one journalist, 
then it intimidates others,

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.224
and soon nations are silenced.

00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:07.942
It's important that we protect our journalists

00:09:07.942 --> 00:09:09.719
and freedom of the press,

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:11.778
because that makes governments
more accountable to us

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:13.763
and more transparent.

00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:15.670
Protecting journalists and our right

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.844
to receive information protects us.

00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:22.860
Our world is changing. We live
in a different world now,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.243
and what were once individual problems

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:28.061
are really now global problems for all of us.

00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:31.700
Two weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.691
democratic transfer of power

00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:36.943
and elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.440
and I'm very optimistic about him,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.419
and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:42.690
the changes that it needs,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.187
especially within the legal sector.

00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:47.090
We live in a different world.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.439
We live in a world where my 
eight-year-old daughter

00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:52.153
only knows a black president.

00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:54.861
There's a great possibility that our next president

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.197
will be a woman,

00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:59.100
and as she gets older, she may question,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.845
can a white guy be president?

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:02.619
(Laughter)

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:05.730
(Applause)

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.910
Our world is changing, and 
we need to change with it,

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.542
and what were once individual problems

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.390
are problems for all of us.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.468
According to UNICEF,

00:10:15.468 --> 00:10:21.509
there are currently over 280 million

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:23.394
boys and girls who are married

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:25.176
under the age of 15.

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:27.219
Two hundred and eighty million.

00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:29.761
Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle

00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:34.181
of poverty, poor health, lack of education.

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:38.868
At the age of 12, Sahar was married.

00:10:38.868 --> 00:10:40.717
She was forced into this marriage

00:10:40.717 --> 00:10:42.417
and sold by her brother.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.485
When she went to her in-laws' house,

00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:47.173
they forced her into prostitution.

00:10:47.173 --> 00:10:50.986
Because she refused, she was tortured.

00:10:50.986 --> 00:10:55.011
She was severely beaten with metal rods.

00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.803
They burned her body.

00:10:57.803 --> 00:11:01.293
They tied her up in a basement and starved her.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:05.503
They used pliers to take out her fingernails.

00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:07.332
At one point,

00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:10.537
she managed to escape from this torture chamber

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.910
to a neighbor's house,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.206
and when she went there, instead of protecting her,

00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:18.221
they dragged her back

00:11:18.221 --> 00:11:19.857
to her husband's house,

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:23.638
and she was tortured even worse.

00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:28.975
When I met first Sahar, thankfully,

00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:30.206
Women for Afghan Women

00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:33.534
gave her a safe haven to go to.

00:11:33.534 --> 00:11:36.720
As a lawyer, I try to be very strong

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.379
for all my clients,

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:42.193
because that's very important to me,

00:11:42.193 --> 00:11:45.122
but seeing her,

00:11:45.122 --> 00:11:49.024
how broken and very weak as she was,

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:52.321
was very difficult.

00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.808
It took weeks for us to really get to

00:11:55.808 --> 00:11:59.164
what happened to her

00:11:59.164 --> 00:12:01.120
when she was in that house,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.760
but finally she started opening up to me,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.080
and when she opened up,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.552
what I heard was

00:12:07.552 --> 00:12:10.152
she didn't know what her rights were,

00:12:10.152 --> 00:12:12.355
but she did know she had 
a certain level of protection

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.982
by her government that failed her,

00:12:14.982 --> 00:12:16.584
and so we were able to talk about

00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:19.126
what her legal options were.

00:12:19.126 --> 00:12:21.134
And so we decided to take this case

00:12:21.134 --> 00:12:22.890
to the Supreme Court.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.760
Now, this is extremely significant,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.673
because this is the first time

00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:29.509
that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:32.302
was being represented by a lawyer,

00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:35.037
a law that's been on the 
books for years and years,

00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:38.443
but until Sahar, had never been used.

00:12:38.443 --> 00:12:40.655
In addition to this, we also decided

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:42.378
to sue for civil damages,

00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:45.325
again using a law that's never been used,

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:48.353
but we used it for her case.

00:12:48.353 --> 00:12:50.615
So there we were at the Supreme Court

00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:53.857
arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.493
me as an American female lawyer,

00:12:56.493 --> 00:12:59.980
and Sahar, a young woman

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.163
who when I met her couldn't 
speak above a whisper.

00:13:05.163 --> 00:13:06.834
She stood up,

00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:09.120
she found her voice,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.917
and my girl told them that she wanted justice,

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.556
and she got it.

00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:17.385
At the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:21.568
that her in-laws should be
arrested for what they did to her,

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.177
her fucking brother should also be arrested

00:13:24.177 --> 00:13:26.123
for selling her —

00:13:26.123 --> 00:13:30.543
(Applause) —

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.546
and they agreed that she did have a right

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:34.964
to civil compensation.

00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:37.743
What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack

00:13:37.743 --> 00:13:40.521
existing bad practices by using the laws

00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:43.459
in the ways that they're intended to be used,

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:45.940
and by protecting Sahar,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.520
we are protecting ourselves.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.152
After having worked in Afghanistan

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:53.150
for over six years now,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.201
a lot of my family and friends think

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.993
that what I do looks like this.

00:13:57.993 --> 00:14:00.499
(Laughter)

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:05.137
But in all actuality, what I do looks like this.

00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:07.010
Now, we can all do something.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.790
I'm not saying we should all buy a
plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.812
but we can all be contributors

00:14:12.812 --> 00:14:14.871
to a global human rights economy.

00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:17.139
We can create a culture of transparency

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.463
and accountability to the laws,

00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:20.874
and make governments more accountable to us,

00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:23.897
as we are to them.

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.889
A few months ago, a South African lawyer

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:27.644
visited me in my office

00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:29.569
and he said, "I wanted to meet you.

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:33.563
I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."

00:14:33.563 --> 00:14:35.542
The laws are ours,

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.575
and no matter what your ethnicity,

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:40.466
nationality, gender, race,

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:42.585
they belong to us,

00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:47.374
and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.

00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:49.615
Businesses also need to get with the program.

00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:51.336
A corporate investment in human rights

00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:53.214
is a capital gain on your businesses,

00:14:53.214 --> 00:14:55.340
and whether you're a business, an NGO,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.435
or a private citizen, rule 
of law benefits all of us.

00:14:59.435 --> 00:15:01.750
And by working together with a concerted mindset,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.206
through the people, public and private sector,

00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:07.503
we can create a global human rights economy

00:15:07.503 --> 00:15:11.036
and all become global investors in human rights.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.820
And by doing this,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.480
we can achieve justness together.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.573
Thank you.

00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:21.573
(Applause)
