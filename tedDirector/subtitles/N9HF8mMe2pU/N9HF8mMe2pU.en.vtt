00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.238
I want to share with you
something my father taught me:

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:19.538
no condition is permanent.

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:23.987
It's a lesson he shared with me
again and again,

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:27.558
and I learned it to be true the hard way.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.327
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.085
This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.821
in Monrovia, Liberia.

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:41.735
My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:44.207
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:46.742
I was nine years old,

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.528
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:50.799
and I was a total math and science geek.

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:55.051
I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.726
But no condition is permanent.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.089
On Christmas Eve in 1989,

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:05.644
civil war erupted in Liberia.

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:08.856
The war started in the rural countryside,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.587
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.281
My school shut down,

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.777
and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.286
people started panicking and fleeing.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.928
My mom came knocking one morning
and said, "Raj, pack your things --

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.241
we have to go."

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.044
We were rushed to the center of town,

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:33.241
and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.946
I stood with my family in one line,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.370
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:40.575
of a rescue plane.

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:44.081
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.524
As I looked out the open hatch,

00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:49.387
I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,

00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.347
children strapped to their backs.

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:55.180
When they tried to jump in with us,

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:57.563
I watched soldiers restrain them.

00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:00.224
They were not allowed to flee.

00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:02.439
We were the lucky ones.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.921
We lost what we had,

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:07.357
but we resettled in America,

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.512
and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:11.874
that rallied around us.

00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:15.555
They took my family into their home,

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.906
they mentored me.

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:20.059
And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.452
I'd visit my father
on weekends as a teenager

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.930
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:27.287
And every time business would get bad,

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:29.794
he'd remind me of that mantra:

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:31.743
no condition is permanent.

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:37.042
That mantra and my parents' persistence
and that community of supporters

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.391
made it possible for me
to go through college

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.132
and eventually to medical school.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:44.924
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,

00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:47.125
but because of them,

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.014
I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.955
My condition had changed.

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.246
It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.039
but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:02.583
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:03.841
and I wanted to go back

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:06.735
to see if I could serve
the people we'd left behind.

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:08.755
But when I got back,

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.606
what I found was utter destruction.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.751
The war had left us with just 51 doctors

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.213
to serve a country of four million people.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.720
It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.304
So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:23.777
you might stand a chance.

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.667
But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:30.056
where you could be days
from the nearest clinic --

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.821
I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:35.988
all because they were
getting to me too late.

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:39.434
Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:41.862
and you realize she could have malaria,

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:44.887
and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs

00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:46.764
would be to take her to the riverbed,

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:48.863
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side

00:03:48.887 --> 00:03:51.502
and then walk for up to two days
through the forest

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:53.333
just to reach the nearest clinic.

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:57.096
One billion people live
in the world's most remote communities,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.765
and despite the advances we've made
in modern medicine and technology,

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.488
our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.

00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:05.473
These communities have been left behind,

00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:07.696
because they've been thought
too hard to reach

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.270
and too difficult to serve.

00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:11.789
Illness is universal;

00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:14.018
access to care is not.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:16.604
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:20.886
No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.355
No condition should be permanent.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.824
And help in this case
didn't come from the outside,

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:29.501
it actually came from within.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:31.526
It came from the communities themselves.

00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:33.357
Meet Musu.

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:34.766
Way out in rural Liberia,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.959
where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:40.506
Musu had been persistent.

00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:44.234
At the age of 18,
she completed high school,

00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:46.084
and she came back to her community.

00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:49.230
She saw that none of the children
were getting treatment

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:51.381
for the diseases
they needed treatment for --

00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:53.725
deadly diseases, like malaria
and pneumonia.

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.866
So she signed up to be a volunteer.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.300
There are millions of volunteers like Musu
in rural parts around our world,

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:03.097
and we got to thinking --

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:06.605
community members like Musu
could actually help us solve a puzzle.

00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:10.600
Our health care system
is structured in such a way

00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:14.332
that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.464
is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.

00:05:18.238 --> 00:05:20.883
But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:24.243
so rural communities like Musu's
have been left behind.

00:05:24.722 --> 00:05:26.477
So we started asking some questions:

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.034
What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?

00:05:29.058 --> 00:05:31.976
What if we could have community
members like Musu

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.277
be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:39.226
What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.374
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?

00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.056
Musu was 48 when I met her.

00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:48.889
And despite her amazing talent and grit,

00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:52.114
she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.

00:05:53.283 --> 00:05:55.669
So what if technology could support her?

00:05:56.204 --> 00:06:00.498
What if we could invest in her
with real training,

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:02.802
equip her with real medicines,

00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:06.874
and have her have a real job?

00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:12.688
Well, in 2007, I was trying
to answer these questions,

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:15.285
and my wife and I were
getting married that year.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.413
We asked our relatives to forgo
the wedding registry gifts

00:06:20.437 --> 00:06:21.987
and instead donate some money

00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.252
so we could have some start-up money
to launch a nonprofit.

00:06:25.938 --> 00:06:28.375
I promise you, I'm a lot
more romantic than that.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:29.549
(Laughter)

00:06:29.983 --> 00:06:32.376
We ended up raising $6,000,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.528
teamed up with some
Liberians and Americans

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:37.290
and launched a nonprofit
called Last Mile Health.

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:42.217
Our goal is to bring a health worker
within reach of everyone, everywhere.

00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:44.175
We designed a three-step process --

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.663
train, equip and pay --

00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:49.044
to invest more deeply
in volunteers like Musu

00:06:49.068 --> 00:06:50.667
to become paraprofessionals,

00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.865
to become community health workers.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.446
First we trained Musu to prevent,
diagnose and treat

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.179
the top 10 diseases afflicting
families in her village.

00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:04.977
A nurse supervisor visited her
every month to coach her.

00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:08.244
We equipped her with modern
medical technology,

00:07:08.268 --> 00:07:11.638
like this $1 malaria rapid test,

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:15.391
and put it in a backpack
full of medicines like this

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:17.772
to treat infections like pneumonia,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.977
and crucially,

00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.289
a smartphone, to help her track
and report on epidemics.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.257
Last, we recognized
the dignity in Musu's work.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.714
With the Liberian government,
we created a contract,

00:07:30.738 --> 00:07:32.024
paid her

00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:34.141
and gave her the chance
to have a real job.

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:35.334
And she's amazing.

00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:38.844
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,

00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:41.627
from screening children for malnutrition,

00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:45.124
to assessing the cause
of a child's cough with a smartphone,

00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:48.269
to supporting people with HIV

00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:52.090
and providing follow-up care
to patients who've lost their limbs.

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:55.870
Working as part of our team,

00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:57.419
working as paraprofessionals,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.672
community health workers can help ensure

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.993
that a lot of what
your family doctor would do

00:08:02.017 --> 00:08:05.837
reaches the places that most
family doctors could never go.

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:08.802
One of my favorite things to do
is to care for patients

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:10.275
with community health workers.

00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.612
So last year I was visiting A.B.,

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:16.275
and like Musu, A.B. had had
a chance to go to school.

00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:19.376
He was in middle school,
in the eighth grade,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.666
when his parents died.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.256
He became an orphan and had to drop out.

00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:29.147
Last year, we hired and trained
A.B. as a community health worker.

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:32.901
And while he was making
door to door house calls,

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:35.148
he met this young boy named Prince,

00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:38.445
whose mother had had trouble
breastfeeding him,

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:41.681
and by the age of six months,
Prince had started to waste away.

00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:45.314
A.B. had just been taught how to use
this color-coded measuring tape

00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:48.884
that wraps around the upper arm
of a child to diagnose malnutrition.

00:08:48.908 --> 00:08:51.299
A.B. noticed that Prince
was in the red zone,

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:53.214
which meant he had to be hospitalized.

00:08:53.238 --> 00:08:55.880
So A.B. took Prince
and his mother to the river,

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.071
got in a canoe

00:08:57.095 --> 00:08:59.755
and paddled for four hours
to get to the hospital.

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:01.984
Later, after Prince was discharged,

00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:06.898
A.B. taught mom how to feed baby
a food supplement.

00:09:07.683 --> 00:09:09.722
A few months ago,

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:12.962
A.B. took me to visit Prince,
and he's a chubby little guy.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.117
(Laughter)

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:17.313
He's meeting his milestones,
he's pulled himself up to a stand,

00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:19.294
and is even starting to say a few words.

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.817
I'm so inspired by these
community health workers.

00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.129
I often ask them why they do what they do,

00:09:24.153 --> 00:09:25.887
and when I asked A.B.,

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:30.749
he said, "Doc, since I dropped out
of school, this is the first time

00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:33.152
I'm having a chance
to hold a pen to write.

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:36.126
My brain is getting fresh."

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:41.602
The stories of A.B. and Musu
have taught me something fundamental

00:09:41.626 --> 00:09:42.934
about being human.

00:09:44.096 --> 00:09:46.152
Our will to serve others

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:50.625
can actually help us
transform our own conditions.

00:09:51.532 --> 00:09:55.626
I was so moved by how powerful
the will to serve our neighbors can be

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.948
a few years ago,

00:09:57.824 --> 00:09:59.827
when we faced a global catastrophe.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.182
In December 2013,

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:05.781
something happened in the rainforests
across the border from us in Guinea.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:10.405
A toddler named Emile fell sick
with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:12.738
He lived in an area
where the roads were sparse

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:15.668
and there had been massive
shortages of health workers.

00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:17.808
Emile died,

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:19.689
and a few weeks later his sister died,

00:10:19.713 --> 00:10:21.633
and a few weeks later his mother died.

00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:24.832
And this disease would spread
from one community to another.

00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.881
And it wasn't until three months later

00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:29.687
that the world recognized this as Ebola.

00:10:30.124 --> 00:10:32.822
When every minute counted,
we had already lost months,

00:10:32.846 --> 00:10:36.299
and by then the virus had spread
like wildfire all across West Africa,

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:38.349
and eventually to other
parts of the world.

00:10:38.373 --> 00:10:41.671
Businesses shut down,
airlines started canceling routes.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:43.111
At the height of the crisis,

00:10:43.135 --> 00:10:47.580
when we were told that 1.4 million
people could be infected,

00:10:47.604 --> 00:10:51.107
when we were told
that most of them would die,

00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:53.545
when we had nearly lost all hope,

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.370
I remember standing with a group
of health workers

00:10:58.394 --> 00:11:01.152
in the rainforest where
an outbreak had just happened.

00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:04.165
We were helping train and equip
them to put on the masks,

00:11:04.189 --> 00:11:06.229
the gloves and the gowns that they needed

00:11:06.253 --> 00:11:08.248
to keep themselves safe from the virus

00:11:08.272 --> 00:11:10.580
while they were serving their patients.

00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:12.905
I remember the fear in their eyes.

00:11:14.312 --> 00:11:18.898
And I remember staying up at night,
terrified if I'd made the right call

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:21.728
to keep them in the field.

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:26.462
When Ebola threatened to bring
humanity to its knees,

00:11:27.316 --> 00:11:30.389
Liberia's community health workers
didn't surrender to fear.

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:33.927
They did what they had always done:

00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:36.905
they answered the call
to serve their neighbors.

00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:41.174
Community members across Liberia
learned the symptoms of Ebola,

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:44.751
teamed up with nurses and doctors
to go door-to-door to find the sick

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.331
and get them into care.

00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:49.765
They tracked thousands of people
who had been exposed to the virus

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:52.212
and helped break
the chain of transmission.

00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:55.546
Some ten thousand community
health workers risked their own lives

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.778
to help hunt down this virus
and stop it in its tracks.

00:11:59.347 --> 00:12:05.232
(Applause)

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:10.026
Today, Ebola has come
under control in West Africa,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.671
and we've learned a few things.

00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:14.767
We've learned that blind spots
in rural health care

00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.589
can lead to hot spots of disease,

00:12:16.613 --> 00:12:19.029
and that places all of us at greater risk.

00:12:19.522 --> 00:12:22.214
We've learned that the most efficient
emergency system

00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:24.266
is actually an everyday system,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.016
and that system has to reach
all communities,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.315
including rural communities like Emile's.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.511
And most of all,

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:34.996
we've learned from the courage
of Liberia's community health workers

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.741
that we as people are not defined
by the conditions we face,

00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:40.829
no matter how hopeless they seem.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.092
We're defined by how we respond to them.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.171
For the past 15 years,

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:51.072
I've seen the power of this idea

00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:55.193
to transform everyday citizens
into community health workers --

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:57.080
into everyday heroes.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:59.746
And I've seen it play out everywhere,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.828
from the forest communities
of West Africa,

00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:04.097
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:05.949
It's true,

00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:09.022
these community health workers
aren't doing neurosurgery,

00:13:09.046 --> 00:13:10.538
but they're making it possible

00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:13.634
to bring health care within reach
of everyone everywhere.

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:16.682
So now what?

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:21.396
Well, we know that there are still
millions of people dying

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.169
from preventable causes

00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:25.068
in rural communities around the world.

00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:28.933
And we know that the great majority
of these deaths are happening

00:13:28.957 --> 00:13:31.280
in these 75 blue-shaded countries.

00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:32.820
What we also know

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:36.287
is that if we trained an army
of community health workers

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.644
to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,

00:13:40.328 --> 00:13:44.444
we could save the lives of nearly
30 million people by 2030.

00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:50.117
Thirty services could save
30 million lives by 2030.

00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:51.884
That's not just a blueprint --

00:13:51.908 --> 00:13:53.703
we're proving this can be done.

00:13:53.727 --> 00:13:54.887
In Liberia,

00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:59.176
the Liberian government is training
thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.358
after Ebola,

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.859
to bring health care to every
child and family in the country.

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:05.914
And we've been honored to work with them,

00:14:05.938 --> 00:14:08.446
and are now teaming up
with a number of organizations

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.692
that are working across other countries

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.739
to try to help them do the same thing.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:16.515
If we could help these countries scale,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.002
we could save millions of lives,

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.382
and at the same time,

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:22.187
we could create millions of jobs.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.617
We simply can't do that, though,
without technology.

00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:30.194
People are worried that technology
is going to steal our jobs,

00:14:30.218 --> 00:14:32.417
but when it comes
to community health workers,

00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:35.697
technology has actually
been vital for creating jobs.

00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:38.137
Without technology --
without this smartphone,

00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:40.883
without this rapid test --

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.313
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.

00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:49.966
And I think it's time
for technology to help us train,

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.530
to help us train people faster
and better than ever before.

00:14:54.398 --> 00:14:55.548
As a doctor,

00:14:55.572 --> 00:14:59.063
I use technology to stay up-to-date
and keep certified.

00:14:59.087 --> 00:15:01.782
I use smartphones, I use apps,
I use online courses.

00:15:01.806 --> 00:15:04.018
But when A.B. wants to learn,

00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:06.137
he's got to jump back in that canoe

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:08.612
and get to the training center.

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:10.828
And when Musu shows up for training,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.135
her instructors are stuck using
flip charts and markers.

00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:20.500
Why shouldn't they have the same
access to learn as I do?

00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:25.832
If we truly want community health workers
to master those lifesaving skills

00:15:25.856 --> 00:15:27.108
and even more,

00:15:27.918 --> 00:15:31.172
we've got to change this old-school
model of education.

00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:34.000
Tech can truly be a game changer here.

00:15:34.024 --> 00:15:37.569
I've been in awe of the digital
education revolution

00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:40.753
that the likes of Khan Academy
and edX have been leading.

00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:44.354
And I've been thinking that it's time;

00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:45.769
it's time for a collision

00:15:45.793 --> 00:15:48.104
between the digital education revolution

00:15:48.128 --> 00:15:50.278
and the community health revolution.

00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:54.523
And so, this brings me
to my TED Prize wish.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.380
I wish --

00:15:57.404 --> 00:15:59.610
I wish that you would help us recruit

00:15:59.634 --> 00:16:03.562
the largest army of community health
workers the world has ever known

00:16:03.888 --> 00:16:06.713
by creating the Community Health Academy,

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:09.942
a global platform to train,
connect and empower.

00:16:10.617 --> 00:16:11.783
(Applause)

00:16:11.808 --> 00:16:12.970
Thank you.

00:16:12.995 --> 00:16:16.597
(Applause)

00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:17.779
Thank you.

00:16:19.636 --> 00:16:21.180
Here's the idea:

00:16:21.204 --> 00:16:23.274
we'll create and curate

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:27.761
the best in digital education resources.

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:33.257
We will bring those to community
health workers around the world,

00:16:33.281 --> 00:16:34.534
including A.B. and Musu.

00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:37.360
They'll get video lessons
on giving kids vaccines

00:16:37.384 --> 00:16:40.597
and have online courses
on spotting the next outbreak,

00:16:40.621 --> 00:16:42.504
so they're not stuck using flip charts.

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:46.364
We'll help these countries
accredit these workers,

00:16:46.388 --> 00:16:51.095
so that they're not stuck remaining
an under-recognized, undervalued group,

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:53.856
but become a renowned,
empowered profession,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.641
just like nurses and doctors.

00:16:57.226 --> 00:17:00.549
And we'll create a network
of companies and entrepreneurs

00:17:00.573 --> 00:17:02.849
who've created innovations
that can save lives

00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:05.253
and help them connect
to workers like Musu,

00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:07.852
so she can help better
serve her community.

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.985
And we'll work tirelessly
to persuade governments

00:17:12.009 --> 00:17:15.991
to make community health workers
a cornerstone of their health care plans.

00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:21.343
We plan to test and prototype
the academy in Liberia

00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:23.239
and a few other partner countries,

00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:25.050
and then we plan to take it global,

00:17:25.074 --> 00:17:27.297
including to rural North America.

00:17:27.923 --> 00:17:29.513
With the power of this platform,

00:17:29.537 --> 00:17:32.099
we believe countries can be more persuaded

00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:35.448
that a health care revolution
really is possible.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.378
My dream is that this academy
will contribute to the training

00:17:40.402 --> 00:17:42.614
of hundreds of thousands
of community members

00:17:42.638 --> 00:17:45.537
to help bring health care
to their neighbors --

00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:47.171
the hundreds of millions of them

00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:49.816
that live in the world's most
remote communities,

00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:52.686
from the forest communities
of West Africa,

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.850
to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:58.936
from the hilltops of Appalachia,
to the mountains of Afghanistan.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.650
If this vision is aligned with yours,

00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:04.895
head to communityhealthacademy.org,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.240
and join this revolution.

00:18:08.356 --> 00:18:13.009
Let us know if you or your organization
or someone you know could help us

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:16.264
as we try to build this academy
over the next year.

00:18:17.394 --> 00:18:19.350
Now, as I look out into this room,

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.836
I realize that our journeys
are not self-made;

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.369
they're shaped by others.

00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:28.236
And there have been so many here
that have been part of this cause.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.470
We're so honored to be part
of this community,

00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:34.177
and a community that's willing
to take on a cause

00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:35.569
as audacious as this one,

00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:37.668
so I wanted to offer, as I end,

00:18:37.692 --> 00:18:38.914
a reflection.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:42.793
I think a lot more about
what my father taught me.

00:18:43.546 --> 00:18:45.747
These days, I too have become a dad.

00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:47.787
I have two sons,

00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:51.799
and my wife and I just learned
that she's pregnant with our third child.

00:18:51.823 --> 00:18:52.831
(Applause)

00:18:52.855 --> 00:18:53.922
Thank you.

00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:55.497
(Applause)

00:18:55.876 --> 00:18:58.704
I was recently caring
for a woman in Liberia

00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:01.453
who, like my wife,
was in her third pregnancy.

00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:03.900
But unlike my wife,

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:07.777
had had no prenatal care
with her first two babies.

00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:13.761
She lived in an isolated community
in the forest that had gone for 100 years

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.174
without any health care

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:17.961
until ...

00:19:17.985 --> 00:19:21.368
until last year when a nurse
trained her neighbors

00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:23.103
to become community health workers.

00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:24.419
So here I was,

00:19:24.443 --> 00:19:28.683
seeing this patient
who was in her second trimester,

00:19:28.707 --> 00:19:31.979
and I pulled out the ultrasound
to check on the baby,

00:19:32.003 --> 00:19:35.542
and she started telling us stories
about her first two kids,

00:19:35.566 --> 00:19:38.764
and I had the ultrasound
probe on her belly,

00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:41.056
and she just stopped mid-sentence.

00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:44.582
She turned to me and she said,

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:46.900
"Doc, what's that sound?"

00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:52.369
It was the first time she'd ever heard
her baby's heartbeat.

00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.991
And her eyes lit up in the same way
my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:01.150
when we heard our baby's heartbeat.

00:20:03.364 --> 00:20:05.517
For all of human history,

00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:10.073
illness has been universal
and access to care has not.

00:20:10.097 --> 00:20:11.983
But as a wise man once told me:

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.998
no condition is permanent.

00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:18.539
It's time.

00:20:18.563 --> 00:20:20.886
It's time for us to go as far as it takes

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.002
to change this condition together.

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.668
Thank you.

00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:29.159
(Applause)
