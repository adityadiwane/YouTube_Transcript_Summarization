00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:15.670
You probably don't know me,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.014
but I am one of those .01 percenters

00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:20.957
that you hear about and read about,

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:25.022
and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:28.112
And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.418
to other plutocrats, to my people,

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.229
because it feels like it's time for us all

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:35.305
to have a chat.

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.883
Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.226
and unapologetic capitalist.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:43.763
I have founded, cofounded or funded

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:47.293
over 30 companies across a range of industries.

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.888
I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:53.609
I cofounded a company called aQuantive

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.479
that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.027
My friends and I, we own a bank.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:02.923
I tell you this — (Laughter) —

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:04.170
unbelievable, right?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
I tell you this to show

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.143
that my life is like most plutocrats.

00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:13.450
I have a broad perspective on capitalism

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.250
and business,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.040
and I have been rewarded obscenely for that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.197
with a life that most of you all

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:23.456
can't even imagine:

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:26.157
multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:30.284
etc., etc., etc.

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.546
But let's be honest: I am not the
smartest person you've ever met.

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.950
I am certainly not the hardest working.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.923
I was a mediocre student.

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:39.141
I'm not technical at all.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.639
I can't write a word of code.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.772
Truly, my success is the consequence

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:47.220
of spectacular luck,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.124
of birth, of circumstance and of timing.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:56.619
But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.263
One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,

00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:03.678
and the other is I have a good sense,

00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:06.303
a good intuition about what will happen in the future,

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:09.586
and I think that that intuition about the future

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:13.156
is the essence of good entrepreneurship.

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.674
So what do I see in our future today,

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:17.676
you ask?

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.331
I see pitchforks,

00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:24.121
as in angry mobs with pitchforks,

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:29.335
because while people like us plutocrats

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.866
are living beyond the dreams of avarice,

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.779
the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.592
are falling farther and farther behind.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:41.080
In 1980, the top one percent of Americans

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.558
shared about eight percent of national [income],

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:46.232
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.775
shared 18 percent.

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:52.127
Thirty years later, today, the top one percent

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:55.749
shares over 20 percent of national [income],

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.650
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.564
share 12 or 13.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:03.010
If the trend continues,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.490
the top one percent will share

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.796
over 30 percent of national [income]

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:08.588
in another 30 years,

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.868
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.607
will share just six.

00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:14.603
You see, the problem isn't that we have

00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:16.684
some inequality.

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:19.136
Some inequality is necessary

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:22.430
for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.140
The problem is that inequality

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.502
is at historic highs today

00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:30.921
and it's getting worse every day.

00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:33.545
And if wealth, power, and income

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.380
continue to concentrate

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.681
at the very tippy top,

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.529
our society will change

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.262
from a capitalist democracy

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.034
to a neo-feudalist rentier society

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:47.019
like 18th-century France.

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.213
That was France

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.960
before the revolution

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.984
and the mobs with the pitchforks.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.538
So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats

00:03:56.538 --> 00:03:58.360
and zillionaires

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.834
and for anyone who lives

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.070
in a gated bubble world:

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.421
Wake up.

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:07.141
Wake up. It cannot last.

00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:09.160
Because if we do not do something

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.491
to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,

00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:16.236
the pitchforks will come for us,

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:20.184
for no free and open society can long sustain

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:23.188
this kind of rising economic inequality.

00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:26.110
It has never happened. There are no examples.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.969
You show me a highly unequal society,

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.448
and I will show you a police state

00:04:29.448 --> 00:04:31.215
or an uprising.

00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:33.358
The pitchforks will come for us

00:04:33.358 --> 00:04:35.269
if we do not address this.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:39.117
It's not a matter of if, it's when.

00:04:39.117 --> 00:04:42.750
And it will be terrible when they come

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.201
for everyone,

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.185
but particularly for people like us plutocrats.

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:52.605
I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.855
I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.117
that economic inequality is wrong.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:02.403
What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:05.924
is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.

00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:09.152
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:11.020
from pitchforks,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.587
but it's also terrible for business too.

00:05:15.587 --> 00:05:19.457
So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:23.270
When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.217
which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,

00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:28.287
he didn't just increase the productivity

00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:30.256
of his factories,

00:05:30.256 --> 00:05:33.653
he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:36.353
into a thriving middle class who could now afford

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:39.570
to buy the products that they made.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.860
Ford intuited what we now know is true,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.861
that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.780
and characterized by the same kinds

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.340
of feedback loops you find

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.080
in a natural ecosystem,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.018
a feedback loop between customers and businesses.

00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:01.124
Raising wages increases demand,

00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:03.205
which increases hiring,

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:05.286
which in turn increases wages

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:07.916
and demand and profits,

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:12.760
and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.909
is precisely what is missing

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.904
from today's economic recovery.

00:06:19.904 --> 00:06:24.522
And this is why we need to put behind us

00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:28.230
the trickle-down policies that so dominate

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.027
both political parties

00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:33.432
and embrace something I call middle-out economics.

00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:35.967
Middle-out economics rejects

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.284
the neoclassical economic idea

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:42.481
that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,

00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:45.608
that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,

00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:49.046
and instead embraces the 21st-century idea

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:52.820
that economies are complex, adaptive,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.822
ecosystemic,

00:06:54.822 --> 00:06:58.170
that they tend away from
equilibrium and toward inequality,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.920
that they're not efficient at all

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.205
but are effective if well managed.

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.476
This 21st-century perspective

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:09.140
allows you to clearly see that capitalism

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.427
does not work by [efficiently] allocating

00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:14.867
existing resources.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:20.865
It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:22.120
to human problems.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.329
The genius of capitalism

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:29.211
is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.

00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:35.162
It rewards people for solving
other people's problems.

00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:38.109
The difference between a poor society

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:40.426
and a rich society, obviously,

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:43.364
is the degree to which that society

00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:45.297
has generated solutions in the form

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:48.156
of products for its citizens.

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:49.977
The sum of the solutions

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:51.968
that we have in our society

00:07:51.968 --> 00:07:54.342
really is our prosperity, and this explains

00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:56.625
why companies like Google and Amazon

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.988
and Microsoft and Apple

00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:01.890
and the entrepreneurs who created those companies

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.450
have contributed so much

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.156
to our nation's prosperity.

00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:10.956
This 21st-century perspective

00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:13.545
also makes clear

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:15.990
that what we think of as economic growth

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.937
is best understood as

00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:20.431
the rate at which we solve problems.

00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.849
But that rate is totally dependent upon

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:27.426
how many problem solvers —

00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:29.912
diverse, able problem solvers — we have,

00:08:29.912 --> 00:08:32.645
and thus how many of our fellow citizens

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.870
actively participate,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.520
both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.162
and as customers who consume them.

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:46.280
But this maximizing participation thing

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.899
doesn't happen by accident.

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:49.868
It doesn't happen by itself.

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:53.597
It requires effort and investment,

00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:56.027
which is why all

00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:59.258
highly prosperous capitalist democracies

00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:01.807
are characterized by massive investments

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.372
in the middle class and the infrastructure

00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:07.240
that they depend on.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.239
We plutocrats need to get this

00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:12.378
trickle-down economics thing behind us,

00:09:12.378 --> 00:09:14.284
this idea that the better we do,

00:09:14.284 --> 00:09:16.951
the better everyone else will do.

00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.871
It's not true. How could it be?

00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:24.999
I earn 1,000 times the median wage,

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.924
but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,

00:09:27.924 --> 00:09:28.988
do I?

00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:32.176
I actually bought two pairs of these pants,

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:34.110
what my partner Mike calls

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.625
my manager pants.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.561
I could have bought 2,000 pairs,

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:41.627
but what would I do with them? (Laughter)

00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:44.656
How many haircuts can I get?

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:48.361
How often can I go out to dinner?

00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:52.434
No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:55.978
we can never drive a great national economy.

00:09:55.978 --> 00:10:01.671
Only a thriving middle class can do that.

00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:03.368
There's nothing to be done,

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:07.509
my plutocrat friends might say.

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:10.713
Henry Ford was in a different time.

00:10:10.713 --> 00:10:12.987
Maybe we can't do some things.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.923
Maybe we can do some things.

00:10:15.923 --> 00:10:19.784
June 19, 2013,

00:10:19.784 --> 00:10:23.217
Bloomberg published an article I wrote called

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:28.150
"The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.072
The good people at Forbes magazine,

00:10:31.072 --> 00:10:33.270
among my biggest admirers,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.990
called it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.219
And yet, just 350 days

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:43.795
after that article was published,

00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:46.744
Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law

00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:50.510
an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.198
to 15 dollars an hour,

00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:53.638
more than double

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:58.330
what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.110
How did this happen,

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.195
reasonable people might ask.

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.863
It happened because a group of us

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.227
reminded the middle class

00:11:05.227 --> 00:11:06.878
that they are the source

00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:10.544
of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:14.110
We reminded them that when
workers have more money,

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.822
businesses have more customers,

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:17.804
and need more employees.

00:11:17.804 --> 00:11:20.490
We reminded them that when businesses

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.210
pay workers a living wage,

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.102
taxpayers are relieved of the burden

00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:26.812
of funding the poverty programs

00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:29.714
like food stamps and medical assistance

00:11:29.714 --> 00:11:31.424
and rent assistance

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.820
that those workers need.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.784
We reminded them that low-wage workers

00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:39.110
make terrible taxpayers,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.128
and that when you raise the minimum wage

00:11:41.128 --> 00:11:43.253
for all businesses,

00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:44.920
all businesses benefit

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.651
yet all can compete.

00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:49.372
Now the orthodox reaction, of course,

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:53.175
is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?

00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:55.763
Your politician's always echoing

00:11:55.763 --> 00:11:58.855
that trickle-down idea by saying things like,

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:00.948
"Well, if you raise the price of employment,

00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:03.740
guess what happens? You get less of it."

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.170
Are you sure?

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.823
Because there's some contravening evidence.

00:12:09.823 --> 00:12:14.582
Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country

00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:16.850
have gone from about 30 times the median wage

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.122
to 500 times.

00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:22.290
That's raising the price of employment.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.262
And yet, to my knowledge,

00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:27.434
I have never seen a company

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:31.180
outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.267
export the job to China.

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:35.293
In fact, we appear to be employing

00:12:35.293 --> 00:12:38.515
more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.

00:12:38.515 --> 00:12:42.705
So too for technology workers

00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:44.531
and financial services workers,

00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:47.149
who earn multiples of the median wage

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:49.154
and yet we employ more and more of them,

00:12:49.154 --> 00:12:54.050
so clearly you can raise the price of employment

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.091
and get more of it.

00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.675
I know that most people

00:12:58.675 --> 00:13:00.397
think that the $15 minimum wage

00:13:00.397 --> 00:13:04.312
is this insane, risky economic experiment.

00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:06.210
We disagree.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.684
We believe that the $15 minimum wage

00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:09.950
in Seattle

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.803
is actually the continuation

00:13:11.803 --> 00:13:14.511
of a logical economic policy.

00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:16.471
It is allowing our city

00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:19.206
to kick your city's ass.

00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:20.965
Because, you see,

00:13:20.965 --> 00:13:22.677
Washington state already has

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.170
the highest minimum wage

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.869
of any state in the nation.

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:28.130
We pay all workers $9.32,

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.973
which is almost 30 percent more

00:13:29.973 --> 00:13:32.531
than the federal minimum of 7.25,

00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:36.484
but crucially, 427 percent more

00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:40.070
than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.686
If trickle-down thinkers were right,

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:45.798
then Washington state should
have massive unemployment.

00:13:45.798 --> 00:13:48.478
Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.

00:13:48.478 --> 00:13:51.501
And yet, Seattle

00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:55.399
is the fastest-growing big city in the country.

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:59.516
Washington state is generating small business jobs

00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:02.137
at a higher rate than any other major state

00:14:02.137 --> 00:14:03.993
in the nation.

00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:07.897
The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:12.285
Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:13.900
when workers have more money,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.426
businesses have more customers

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.683
and need more workers.

00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:20.834
When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:24.456
so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:27.121
that's not bad for the restaurant business.

00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.820
That's good for it,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.399
despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:35.457
Is it more complicated than I'm making out?

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:36.454
Of course it is.

00:14:36.454 --> 00:14:38.322
There are a lot of dynamics at play.

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:40.564
But can we please stop insisting

00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:43.365
that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:44.873
unemployment will skyrocket

00:14:44.873 --> 00:14:46.201
and the economy will collapse?

00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:48.810
There is no evidence for it.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.041
The most insidious thing

00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:51.888
about trickle-down economics

00:14:51.888 --> 00:14:54.190
is not the claim that if the rich get richer,

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.727
everyone is better off.

00:14:55.727 --> 00:14:58.788
It is the claim made by those who oppose

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:00.690
any increase in the minimum wage

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.545
that if the poor get richer,

00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:04.762
that will be bad for the economy.

00:15:04.762 --> 00:15:06.742
This is nonsense.

00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:10.607
So can we please dispense with this rhetoric

00:15:10.607 --> 00:15:12.950
that says that rich guys like me

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.804
and my plutocrat friends

00:15:15.804 --> 00:15:18.377
made our country?

00:15:18.377 --> 00:15:20.452
We plutocrats know,

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.076
even if we don't like to admit it in public,

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:24.745
that if we had been born somewhere else,

00:15:24.745 --> 00:15:26.642
not here in the United States,

00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:29.502
we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot

00:15:29.502 --> 00:15:32.652
by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:35.183
It's not that they don't have good
entrepreneurs in other places,

00:15:35.183 --> 00:15:37.208
even very, very poor places.

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:38.760
It's just that that's all

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.296
that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.

00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:47.895
So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,

00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.442
a new kind of politics

00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:52.329
that I call new capitalism.

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:54.801
Let's acknowledge that capitalism

00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:56.598
beats the alternatives,

00:15:56.598 --> 00:16:00.595
but also that the more people we include,

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:04.119
both as entrepreneurs and as customers,

00:16:04.119 --> 00:16:06.279
the better it works.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:10.065
Let's by all means shrink the size of government,

00:16:10.065 --> 00:16:12.784
but not by slashing the poverty programs,

00:16:12.784 --> 00:16:14.801
but by ensuring that workers are paid enough

00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:18.123
so that they actually don't need those programs.

00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:21.040
Let's invest enough in the middle class

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.233
to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:28.167
and by fairer, more truly competitive,

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:29.929
and by more truly competitive,

00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:32.745
more able to generate the solutions

00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:34.217
to human problems

00:16:34.217 --> 00:16:39.847
that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.

00:16:39.847 --> 00:16:43.120
Capitalism is the greatest social technology

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.589
ever invented

00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:47.451
for creating prosperity in human societies,

00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:49.185
if it is well managed,

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:52.356
but capitalism, because of the fundamental

00:16:52.356 --> 00:16:55.121
multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,

00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:58.649
tends towards, inexorably, inequality,

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:03.070
concentration and collapse.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.518
The work of democracies

00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:10.021
is to maximize the inclusion of the many

00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:12.998
in order to create prosperity,

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:16.920
not to enable the few to accumulate money.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.020
Government does create prosperity and growth,

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.246
by creating the conditions that allow

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:26.137
both entrepreneurs and their customers

00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:27.982
to thrive.

00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:31.166
Balancing the power of capitalists like me

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:34.338
and workers isn't bad for capitalism.

00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:36.138
It's essential to it.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.804
Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,

00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:40.818
affordable healthcare,

00:17:40.818 --> 00:17:42.121
paid sick leave,

00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:45.540
and the progressive taxation necessary

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.736
to pay for the important infrastructure

00:17:47.736 --> 00:17:51.787
necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,

00:17:51.787 --> 00:17:54.353
these are indispensable tools

00:17:54.353 --> 00:17:56.462
shrewd capitalists should embrace

00:17:56.462 --> 00:18:00.448
to drive growth, because no one benefits from it

00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:02.094
like us.

00:18:02.094 --> 00:18:04.342
Many economists would have you believe

00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:07.422
that their field is an objective science.

00:18:07.422 --> 00:18:10.269
I disagree, and I think that it is equally

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:12.338
a tool that humans use

00:18:12.338 --> 00:18:14.227
to enforce and encode

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:17.803
our social and moral preferences and prejudices

00:18:17.803 --> 00:18:21.705
about status and power,

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:23.982
which is why plutocrats like me

00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:27.988
have always needed to find persuasive stories

00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:29.662
to tell everyone else

00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:33.776
about why our relative positions

00:18:33.776 --> 00:18:37.908
are morally righteous and good for everyone:

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:42.183
like, we are indispensable, the job creators,

00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:44.545
and you are not;

00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:47.931
like, tax cuts for us create growth,

00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:49.945
but investments in you

00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.621
will balloon our debt

00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:54.129
and bankrupt our great country;

00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:55.997
that we matter;

00:18:55.997 --> 00:18:58.348
that you don't.

00:18:58.348 --> 00:19:00.991
For thousands of years, these stories were called

00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:02.439
divine right.

00:19:02.439 --> 00:19:06.693
Today, we have trickle-down economics.

00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:10.576
How obviously, transparently self-serving

00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:12.170
all of this is.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.952
We plutocrats need to see

00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:17.305
that the United States of America made us,

00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:18.989
not the other way around;

00:19:18.989 --> 00:19:21.827
that a thriving middle class is the source

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.123
of prosperity in capitalist economies,

00:19:24.123 --> 00:19:26.762
not a consequence of it.

00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:29.453
And we should never forget

00:19:29.453 --> 00:19:33.148
that even the best of us in
the worst of circumstances

00:19:33.148 --> 00:19:38.882
are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

00:19:38.882 --> 00:19:41.496
Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:43.699
to recommit to our country,

00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.261
to commit to a new kind of capitalism

00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:50.615
which is both more inclusive and more effective,

00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:52.673
a capitalism that will ensure

00:19:52.673 --> 00:19:55.834
that America's economy remains

00:19:55.834 --> 00:19:59.220
the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.380
Let's secure the future for ourselves,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.114
our children and their children.

00:20:04.114 --> 00:20:07.162
Or alternatively, we could do nothing,

00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:09.243
hide in our gated communities

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:12.100
and private schools,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.136
enjoy our planes and yachts

00:20:14.136 --> 00:20:16.476
— they're fun —

00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.287
and wait for the pitchforks.

00:20:18.287 --> 00:20:19.810
Thank you.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.457
(Applause)
