Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman
doesn't need much of an introduction,

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.054
but TED's audience is global,

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:19.275
it's diverse,

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:22.285
so I've been tasked
with starting with his bio,

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:24.595
which could easily take up
the entire 18 minutes.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.562
So instead we're going to do
93 years in 93 seconds or less.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:29.736
(Laughter)

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:31.805
You were born in New Hampshire.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.544
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:34.854
EH: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:37.766
(Laughter)

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.410
NL: There goes seven more seconds.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.677
EH: Nailed it.

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.691
(Laughter)

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.947
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:47.376
Your father was a con man --
I got that right.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.147
He was taken away to prison
when you were nine years old.

00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:53.328
You flew 52 missions
as a fighter pilot in World War II.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.836
You came back to --

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.010
NL: Radio operator.

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.025
EH: You came to LA
to break into Hollywood,

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.929
first in publicity, then in TV.

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.112
You had no training as a writer, formally,

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:04.540
but you hustled your way in.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.017
Your breakthrough, your debut,

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.309
was a little show
called "All in the Family."

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.437
You followed that up with a string of hits

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.579
that to this day is unmatched
in Hollywood:

00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:14.643
"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.493
"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"

00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:17.930
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.717
to name literally a fraction of them.

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.518
Not only are they all commercially --

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:25.548
(Applause)

00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:28.557
Not only are they all
commercially successful,

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.555
but many of them push our culture forward

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.941
by giving the underrepresented
members of society

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.001
their first prime-time voice.

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.644
You have seven shows
in the top 10 at one time.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.262
At one point,

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:43.623
you aggregate an audience
of 120 million people per week

00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:44.873
watching your content.

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:47.136
That's more than the audience
for Super Bowl 50,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.399
which happens once a year.

00:01:48.423 --> 00:01:49.645
NL: Holy shit.

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.442
(Laughter)

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.688
(Applause)

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.071
EH: And we're not even
to the holy shit part.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.134
(Laughter)

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.885
You land yourself
on Richard Nixon's enemies list --

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.059
he had one.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.494
That's an applause line, too.

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:05.320
(Applause)

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:08.941
You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame
on the first day that it exists.

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:10.365
Then came the movies.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.969
"Fried Green Tomatoes,"

00:02:11.993 --> 00:02:14.018
"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:15.215
"This Is Spinal Tap."

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.376
(Applause)

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.932
Again, just to name a fraction.

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:18.987
(Applause)

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.517
Then you wipe the slate clean,

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:24.588
start a third act as a political activist
focusing on protecting the First Amendment

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:26.562
and the separation of church and state.

00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:28.476
You start People For The American Way.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.358
You buy the Declaration of Independence

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:31.873
and give it back to the people.

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:34.235
You stay active in both
entertainment and politics

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.791
until the ripe old of age of 93,

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:37.061
when you write a book

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.249
and make a documentary
about your life story.

00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:40.447
And after all that,

00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.013
they finally think
you're ready for a TED Talk.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.818
(Laughter)

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:49.414
(Applause)

00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.236
NL: I love being here.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.975
And I love you for agreeing to do this.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.988
EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.

00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:57.559
So here's my first question.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.633
Was your mother proud of you?

00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.653
(Laughter)

00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:03.388
NL: My mother ...

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:04.579
what a place to start.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.118
Let me put it this way --

00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:10.762
when I came back from the war,

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:16.374
she showed me the letters
that I had written her from overseas,

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.795
and they were absolute love letters.

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.540
(Laughter)

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:25.286
This really sums up my mother.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.881
They were love letters,

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:29.107
as if I had written them to --

00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:30.428
they were love letters.

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:37.747
A year later I asked my mother
if I could have them,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:42.048
because I'd like to keep them
all the years of my life ...

00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.581
She had thrown them away.

00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:47.668
(Laughter)

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.194
That's my mother.

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:52.696
(Laughter)

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.240
The best way I can sum it up
in more recent times is --

00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.561
this is also more recent times --

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:02.767
a number of years ago,

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:06.664
when they started the Hall of Fame
to which you referred.

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:08.471
It was a Sunday morning,

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:13.749
when I got a call from the fellow who ran
the TV Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:16.742
He was calling me to tell me
they had met all day yesterday

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:20.979
and he was confidentially telling me
they were going to start a hall of fame

00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:23.757
and these were the inductees.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.123
I started to say "Richard Nixon,"

00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:30.789
because Richard Nixon --

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:32.684
EH: I don't think he was on their list.

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:35.231
NL: William Paley, who started CBS,

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:38.889
David Sarnoff, who started NBC,

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:40.068
Edward R. Murrow,

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:43.794
the greatest of the foreign
correspondents,

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:44.989
Paddy Chayefsky --

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.775
I think the best writer
that ever came out of television --

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.776
Milton Berle, Lucille Ball

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.181
and me.

00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:52.356
EH: Not bad.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.095
NL: I call my mother
immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:56.642
"Mom, this is what's happened,

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.265
they're starting a hall of fame."

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.012
I tell her the list of names and me,

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:01.194
and she says,

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.955
"Listen, if that's what they
want to do, who am I to say?"

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.480
(Laughter)

00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:10.420
(Applause)

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:11.801
That's my Ma.

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:13.705
I think it earns that kind of a laugh

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.825
because everybody
has a piece of that mother.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.023
(Laughter)

00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:19.904
EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother
is born, right there.

00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:25.158
So your father also played
a large role in your life,

00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:26.832
mostly by his absence.

00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:28.013
NL: Yeah.

00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:30.660
EH: Tell us what happened
when you were nine years old.

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:35.563
NL: He was flying to Oklahoma

00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:37.658
with three guys that my mother said,

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:40.064
"I don't want you to have
anything to do with them,

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:41.341
I don't trust those men."

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.390
That's when I heard,

00:05:43.414 --> 00:05:44.897
maybe not for the first time,

00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.587
"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."

00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:50.088
And he went.

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:55.129
It turns out he was picking up
some fake bonds,

00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:58.676
which he was flying
across the country to sell.

00:05:59.764 --> 00:06:03.311
But the fact that he was going
to Oklahoma in a plane,

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:07.026
and he was going to bring me
back a 10-gallon hat,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.748
just like Ken Maynard,
my favorite cowboy wore.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:19.212
You know, this was a few years
after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.

00:06:19.236 --> 00:06:22.833
I mean, it was exotic
that my father was going there.

00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:24.098
But when he came back,

00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:26.186
they arrested him as he got off the plane.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:30.949
That night newspapers
were all over the house,

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.593
my father was with his hat
in front of his face,

00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:35.116
manacled to a detective.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.378
And my mother was selling the furniture,
because we were leaving --

00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:43.211
she didn't want to stay
in that state of shame,

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:45.700
in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:50.192
And selling the furniture --

00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:52.276
the house was loaded with people.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.830
And in the middle of all of that,

00:06:54.854 --> 00:07:01.042
some strange horse's ass
put his hand on my shoulder and said,

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:03.192
"Well, you're the man of the house now."

00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:10.553
I'm crying, and this asshole says,
"You're the man of the house now."

00:07:11.268 --> 00:07:14.202
And I think that was the moment

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:18.336
I began to understand the foolishness
of the human condition.

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:21.836
So ...

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:27.138
it took a lot of years to look back at it
and feel it was a benefit.

00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:29.587
But --

00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:31.879
EH: It's interesting
you call it a benefit.

00:07:31.903 --> 00:07:34.334
NL: Benefit in that it gave
me that springboard.

00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:38.138
I mean that I could think

00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:41.350
how foolish it was to say
to this crying nine-year-old boy,

00:07:41.374 --> 00:07:43.279
"You're the man of the house now."

00:07:43.303 --> 00:07:46.716
And then I was crying, and then he said,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.890
"And men of the house don't cry."

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:51.295
And I ...

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.604
(Laughter)

00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:54.044
So ...

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:57.920
I look back, and I think

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:02.087
that's when I learned the foolishness
of the human condition,

00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:05.039
and it's been that gift that I've used.

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:08.543
EH: So you have a father who's absent,

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:11.513
you have a mother for whom
apparently nothing is good enough.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.132
Do you think that starting out as a kid
who maybe never felt heard

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.678
started you down a journey

00:08:18.702 --> 00:08:20.480
that ended with you being an adult

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:22.805
with a weekly audience
of 120 million people?

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:26.879
NL: I love the way you put that question,

00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:30.722
because I guess
I've spent my life wanting --

00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:32.732
if anything, wanting to be heard.

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:38.152
I think --

00:08:40.524 --> 00:08:42.096
It's a simple answer, yes,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.436
that was what sparked --

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.564
well, there were other things, too.

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:50.419
When my father was away,

00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:56.485
I was fooling with a crystal radio set
that we had made together,

00:08:56.509 --> 00:09:01.080
and I caught a signal that turned out
to be Father Coughlin.

00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:02.834
(Laughter)

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.112
Yeah, somebody laughed.

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:07.563
(Laughter)

00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:09.018
But not funny,

00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:10.542
this was a horse's --

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.182
another horse's ass --

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:14.797
who was very vocal
about hating the New Deal

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.284
and Roosevelt and Jews.

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:21.589
The first time I ran into an understanding

00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:24.506
that there were people
in this world that hated me

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.466
because I was born to Jewish parents.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:31.418
And that had an enormous
effect on my life.

00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:34.042
EH: So you had a childhood

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:37.148
with little in the way
of strong male role models,

00:09:37.172 --> 00:09:38.708
except for your grandfather.

00:09:39.272 --> 00:09:41.152
Tell us about him.

00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:42.326
NL: Oh, my grandfather.

00:09:43.323 --> 00:09:47.784
Well here's the way I always
talked about that grandfather.

00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:50.756
There were parades,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.661
lots of parades when I was a kid.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.597
There were parades on Veteran's Day --

00:09:54.621 --> 00:09:56.189
there wasn't a President's Day.

00:09:56.213 --> 00:09:58.126
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.254
George Washington's birthday

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:02.768
and Flag Day ...

00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:05.580
And lots of little parades.

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.033
My grandfather used to take me

00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:08.783
and we'd stand on the street corner,

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:10.143
he'd hold my hand,

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:13.230
and I'd look up and I'd see a tear
running down his eye.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.274
And he meant a great deal to me.

00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:23.656
And he used to write presidents
of the United States.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.300
Every letter started,

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.403
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,"

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:33.045
and he'd tell him something
wonderful about what he did.

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:36.001
But when he disagreed
with the President, he also wrote,

00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:37.692
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,

00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:39.510
Didn't I tell you last week ...?"

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:41.113
(Laughter)

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:46.739
And I would run down the stairs
every now and then

00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:47.995
and pick up the mail.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:49.238
We were three flights up,

00:10:49.262 --> 00:10:51.487
74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:59.557
And I'd pick up a little white envelope
reading, "Shya C. called at this address."

00:11:02.734 --> 00:11:07.270
And that's the story I have told
about my grandfather --

00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:09.315
EH: They wrote him back
on the envelopes --

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:10.559
NL: They wrote back.

00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:17.268
But I have shown them myself,

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:22.410
going way back to Phil Donahue
and others before him,

00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:26.743
literally dozens of interviews
in which I told that story.

00:11:28.283 --> 00:11:33.402
This will be the second time I have said
the whole story was a lie.

00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:40.343
The truth was my grandfather
took me to parades,

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.690
we had lots of those.

00:11:42.094 --> 00:11:44.474
The truth is a tear came down his eye.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.047
The truth is he would write
an occasional letter,

00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.474
and I did pick up those little envelopes.

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:55.948
But "My dearest darling Mr. President,"

00:11:55.972 --> 00:11:58.434
all the rest of it,

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:02.974
is a story I borrowed from a good friend

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:08.508
whose grandfather was that grandfather
who wrote those letters.

00:12:10.506 --> 00:12:16.951
And, I mean, I stole
Arthur Marshall's grandfather

00:12:16.975 --> 00:12:18.705
and made him my own.

00:12:20.997 --> 00:12:22.147
Always.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.785
When I started to write my memoir --

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:26.261
"Even this --"

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:27.450
How about that?

00:12:27.474 --> 00:12:29.705
"Even This I Get to Experience."

00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:32.599
When I started to write the memoir

00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:34.182
and I started to think about it,

00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:35.356
and then I --

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:37.425
I --

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:42.331
I did a reasonable amount of crying,

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:46.188
and I realized how much
I needed the father.

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:50.440
So much so that I appropriated
Arthur Marshall's grandfather.

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:54.012
So much so, the word "father" --

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.518
I have six kids by the way.

00:12:57.273 --> 00:12:58.980
My favorite role in life.

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:03.958
It and husband to my wife Lyn.

00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:12.453
But I stole the man's identity
because I needed the father.

00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:16.926
Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.957
and come out on the other side,

00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:20.568
and I forgive my father --

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:21.802
the best thing I --

00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:23.115
the worst thing I --

00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:26.795
The word I'd like to use about him
and think about him is --

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.187
he was a rascal.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.933
The fact that he lied
and stole and cheated

00:13:33.957 --> 00:13:35.157
and went to prison ...

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:41.206
I submerge that in the word "rascal."

00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:47.936
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs
borrow and professionals steal.

00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:49.591
NL: I'm a pro.

00:13:49.615 --> 00:13:50.766
EH: You're a pro.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.106
(Laughter)

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.277
And that quote is widely
attributed to John Lennon,

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.491
but it turns out
he stole it from T.S. Eliot.

00:13:57.515 --> 00:13:58.904
So you're in good company.

00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:00.086
(Laughter)

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:04.927
EH: I want to talk about your work.

00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.657
Obviously the impact of your work
has been written about

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.047
and I'm sure you've heard
about it all your life:

00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:11.222
what it meant to people,

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:12.676
what it meant to our culture,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.701
you heard the applause when I just
named the names of the shows,

00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:19.153
you raised half the people
in the room through your work.

00:14:19.177 --> 00:14:22.712
But have there ever been any stories
about the impact of your work

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.050
that surprised you?

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.954
NL: Oh, god --

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:31.279
surprised me and delighted me
from head to toe.

00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:38.930
There was "An Evening with Norman Lear"
within the last year

00:14:38.954 --> 00:14:42.458
that a group of hip-hop impresarios,

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:46.418
performers and the Academy put together.

00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:49.806
The subtext of "An Evening with ..."

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.919
was: What do a 92-year-old Jew --

00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:55.094
then 92 --

00:14:55.118 --> 00:14:57.131
and the world of hip-hop have in common?

00:14:57.155 --> 00:14:59.844
Russell Simmons
was among seven on the stage.

00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:05.104
And when he talked about the shows,

00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:09.661
he wasn't talking about the Hollywood,

00:15:09.685 --> 00:15:13.409
George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,"

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:15.848
or the show that was a number five show.

00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:22.498
He was talking about a simple
thing that made a big --

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.525
EH: Impact on him?

00:15:26.549 --> 00:15:28.487
NL: An impact on him --

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.018
I was hesitating over the word, "change."

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.993
It's hard for me to imagine,

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.845
you know, changing somebody's life,

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:37.654
but that's the way he put it.

00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:43.767
He saw George Jefferson
write a check on "The Jeffersons,"

00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:47.401
and he never knew that a black man
could write a check.

00:15:48.788 --> 00:15:53.741
And he says it just
impacted his life so --

00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:55.450
it changed his life.

00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:58.948
And when I hear things like that --

00:15:58.972 --> 00:16:00.647
little things --

00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:03.853
because I know that there isn't
anybody in this audience

00:16:03.877 --> 00:16:10.380
that wasn't likely responsible today for
some little thing they did for somebody,

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:15.746
whether it's as little as a smile
or an unexpected "Hello,"

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.134
that's how little this thing was.

00:16:18.833 --> 00:16:23.104
It could have been the dresser of the set

00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:24.814
who put the checkbook on the thing,

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:28.527
and George had nothing to do
while he was speaking, so he wrote it,

00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:29.827
I don't know.

00:16:29.851 --> 00:16:31.001
But --

00:16:31.634 --> 00:16:34.572
EH: So in addition to the long list
I shared in the beginning,

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:37.242
I should have also mentioned
that you invented hip-hop.

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:38.367
(Laughter)

00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:39.834
NL: Well ...

00:16:40.755 --> 00:16:42.240
EH: I want to talk about --

00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:43.564
NL: Well, then do it.

00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:48.398
(Laughter)

00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:52.468
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,

00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:54.428
but you've also built a life of meaning.

00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:57.381
And all of us strive to do
both of those things --

00:16:57.405 --> 00:16:58.999
not all of us manage to.

00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:03.755
But even those of us who do manage
to accomplish both of those,

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:06.349
very rarely do we figure out
how to do them together.

00:17:06.884 --> 00:17:11.764
You managed to push culture
forward through your art

00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:15.646
while also achieving world-beating
commercial success.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.860
How did you do both?

00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:29.207
NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear
that recitation of all I accomplished.

00:17:31.304 --> 00:17:35.360
This planet is one of a billion,

00:17:35.384 --> 00:17:36.573
they tell us,

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:42.693
in a universe
of which there are billions --

00:17:42.717 --> 00:17:44.285
billions of universes,

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:47.916
billions of planets ...

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.823
which we're trying to save

00:17:49.847 --> 00:17:51.631
and it requires saving.

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:54.723
But ...

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:59.349
anything I may have accomplished is --

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.809
my sister once asked me
what she does about something

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.775
that was going on
in Newington, Connecticut.

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:09.724
And I said, "Write your alderman
or your mayor or something."

00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:12.886
She said, "Well I'm not
Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:18.335
And that was the first time
I said what I'm saying,

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:22.698
I said, "Claire. With everything
you think about what I may have done

00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:24.199
and everything you've done," --

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:26.566
she never left Newington --

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.400
"can you get your fingers close enough

00:18:28.424 --> 00:18:32.341
when you consider the size
of the planet and so forth,

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:35.579
to measure anything I may have done
to anything you may have done?"

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.380
So ...

00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:42.074
I am convinced we're all responsible

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:45.319
for doing as much
as I may have accomplished.

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:49.159
And I understand what you're saying --

00:18:49.183 --> 00:18:50.898
EH: It's an articulate deflection --

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.880
NL: But you have to really buy into
the size and scope

00:18:54.904 --> 00:18:56.858
of the creator's enterprise, here.

00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:59.466
EH: But here on this planet
you have really mattered.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.640
NL: I'm a son of a gun.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:02.502
(Laughter)

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:06.324
EH: So I have one more question for you.

00:19:06.348 --> 00:19:07.621
How old do you feel?

00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:13.823
NL: I am the peer
of whoever I'm talking to.

00:19:14.704 --> 00:19:16.076
EH: Well, I feel 93.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.660
(Applause)

00:19:22.684 --> 00:19:23.994
NL: We out of here?

00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:25.902
EH: Well, I feel 93 years old,

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:29.715
but I hope to one day feel as young
as the person I'm sitting across from.

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:30.889
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:19:30.913 --> 00:19:32.337
the incomparable Norman Lear.

00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:38.025
(Applause)

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:39.200
NL: Thank you.

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:45.165
(Applause)
