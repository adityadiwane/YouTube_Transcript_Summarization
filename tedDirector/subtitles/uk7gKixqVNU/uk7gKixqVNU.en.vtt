00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:16.270
["Rebecca Newberger Goldstein"]

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.349
["Steven Pinker"]

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.626
["The Long Reach of Reason"]

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:26.641
Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars.
Steven Pinker: Okay.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:33.975
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason 
appears to have fallen on hard times:

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.310
Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.776
and political discourse has become a race

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.791
to the bottom.

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:47.345
We're living in an era of scientific creationism,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:51.359
9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.466
and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.520
People who think too well

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.876
are often accused of elitism,

00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:01.035
and even in the academy,

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:03.684
there are attacks on logocentrism,

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:08.569
the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.076
SP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:13.295
Perhaps reason is overrated.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.438
Many pundits have argued that a good heart

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:17.388
and steadfast moral clarity

00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:21.626
are superior to triangulations
of overeducated policy wonks,

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.291
like the best and brightest and that dragged us

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.153
into the quagmire of Vietnam.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.975
And wasn't it reason that gave us the means

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:29.705
to despoil the planet

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.726
and threaten our species with
weapons of mass destruction?

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.965
In this way of thinking, 
it's character and conscience,

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:39.091
not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.

00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.956
Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:45.474
My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:47.375
by our bodies and our emotions

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.360
and use our puny powers of reason

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.720
merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.917
RNG: How could a reasoned
argument logically entail

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:59.349
the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.185
Look, you're trying to persuade
us of reason's impotence.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.572
You're not threatening us or bribing us,

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.203
suggesting that we resolve the issue

00:02:07.203 --> 00:02:10.411
with a show of hands or a beauty contest.

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:14.348
By the very act of trying to
reason us into your position,

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:17.366
you're conceding reason's potency.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.372
Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:21.770
You show up for that debate

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.612
and you've already lost it.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:27.327
SP: But can reason lead us in directions

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:29.999
that are good or decent or moral?

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.510
After all, you pointed out that reason

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.284
is just a means to an end,

00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:36.750
and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.317
Reason can lay out a road
map to peace and harmony

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.173
if the reasoner wants peace and harmony,

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:44.000
but it can also lay out a road
map to conflict and strife

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.677
if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:49.003
Can reason force the reasoner to want

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.312
less cruelty and waste?

00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:54.584
RNG: All on its own, the answer is no,

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:57.345
but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.

00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:59.699
You need two conditions:

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.258
The first is that reasoners all care

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:03.968
about their own well-being.

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.864
That's one of the passions that has to be present

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:09.068
in order for reason to go to work,

00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:10.956
and it's obviously present in all of us.

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:13.486
We all care passionately

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.750
about our own well-being.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.583
The second condition is that reasoners

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.068
are members of a community of reasoners

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:22.142
who can affect one another's well-being,

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:23.655
can exchange messages,

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.483
and comprehend each other's reasoning.

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:29.469
And that's certainly true of our gregarious

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.481
and loquatious species,

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.337
well endowed with the instinct for language.

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:36.659
SP: Well, that sounds good in theory,

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.673
but has it worked that way in practice?

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:40.507
In particular, can it explain

00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:42.438
a momentous historical development

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:45.305
that I spoke about five years ago here at TED?

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.950
Namely, we seem to be getting more humane.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.310
Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.570
as a form of popular entertainment.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.449
Knights waged constant war on each other

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.615
by trying to kill as many of each
other's peasants as possible.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:01.290
Governments executed people for frivolous reasons,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.700
like stealing a cabbage

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.948
or criticizing the royal garden.

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:07.201
The executions were designed to be as prolonged

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.139
and as painful as possible, like crucifixion,

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.233
disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:14.299
Respectable people kept slaves.

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.272
For all our flaws, we have abandoned

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:17.765
these barbaric practices.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.533
RNG: So, do you think it's
human nature that's changed?

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:23.318
SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:24.917
that can erupt in violence,

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:29.287
like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:32.286
But we also have instincts that can steer us away,

00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:35.778
like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:37.054
what Abraham Lincoln called

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:38.643
the better angels of our nature.

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:40.685
RNG: So if human nature didn't change,

00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.684
what invigorated those better angels?

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.217
SP: Well, among other things,

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.359
our circle of empathy expanded.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.806
Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.279
only of their family and people in their village.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.081
But with the expansion of literacy and travel,

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:56.007
people started to sympathize

00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:57.672
with wider and wider circles,

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.553
the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,

00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:03.508
and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:05.714
RNG: Can hard-headed scientists

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:08.735
really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:10.416
SP: They can and do.

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.417
Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.597
that respond to other people's actions

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:16.664
the same way they respond to our own.

00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:18.391
Empathy emerges early in life,

00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:20.274
perhaps before the age of one.

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:21.917
Books on empathy have become bestsellers,

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:23.931
like "The Empathic Civilization"

00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:26.111
and "The Age of Empathy."

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:28.809
RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:32.477
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.347
for making moral progress.

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:36.534
For one thing, it's innately biased

00:05:36.534 --> 00:05:38.660
toward blood relations, babies

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.494
and warm, fuzzy animals.

00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:42.893
As far as empathy is concerned,

00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:46.426
ugly outsiders can go to hell.

00:05:46.426 --> 00:05:49.829
And even our best attempts to work up sympathy

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:51.813
for those who are unconnected with us

00:05:51.813 --> 00:05:56.012
fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:58.566
that was pointed out by Adam Smith.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.347
Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:02.962
of China was suddenly swallowed
up by an earthquake,

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.552
and let us consider how a 
man of humanity in Europe

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:07.254
would react on receiving intelligence

00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:09.317
of this dreadful calamity.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.534
He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly

00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:14.194
his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.

00:06:14.194 --> 00:06:16.071
He would make many melancholy reflections

00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.261
upon the precariousness of human life,

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.275
and when all these humane sentiments

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:22.118
had been once fairly expressed,

00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:24.370
he would pursue his business or his pleasure

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.519
with the same ease and tranquility

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.611
as if no such accident had happened.

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.153
If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,

00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:32.690
he would not sleep tonight,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.432
but provided he never saw them,

00:06:34.432 --> 00:06:36.870
he would snore with the most profound security

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.779
over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.682
SP: But if empathy wasn't enough
to make us more humane,

00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:44.242
what else was there?

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:46.936
RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:50.762
one of our most effective better angels: reason.

00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:53.330
Reason has muscle.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.704
It's reason that provides the push to widen

00:06:56.704 --> 00:06:58.849
that circle of empathy.

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.757
Every one of the humanitarian developments

00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:04.355
that you mentioned originated with thinkers

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:07.225
who gave reasons for why some practice

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.183
was indefensible.

00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:11.822
They demonstrated that the way people treated

00:07:11.822 --> 00:07:13.769
some particular group of others

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:15.555
was logically inconsistent

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:18.127
with the way they insisted
on being treated themselves.

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:19.821
SP: Are you saying that reason

00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:22.127
can actually change people's minds?

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:24.057
Don't people just stick with whatever conviction

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:25.538
serves their interests

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:28.354
or conforms to the culture that they grew up in?

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:31.513
RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.591
Contradictions bother us,

00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.726
at least when we're forced to confront them,

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:37.544
which is just another way of saying

00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:40.290
that we are susceptible to reason.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.121
And if you look at the history of moral progress,

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.828
you can trace a direct pathway
from reasoned arguments

00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:50.167
to changes in the way that we actually feel.

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:53.748
Time and again, a thinker would lay out an argument

00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:57.018
as to why some practice was indefensible,

00:07:57.018 --> 00:08:02.067
irrational, inconsistent with values already held.

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:04.135
Their essay would go viral,

00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:06.420
get translated into many languages,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.770
get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.377
and at dinner parties,

00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:15.430
and influence leaders, legislators,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.968
popular opinion.

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:20.221
Eventually their conclusions get absorbed

00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:22.548
into the common sense of decency,

00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:25.237
erasing the tracks of the original argument

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:27.045
that had gotten us there.

00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:29.842
Few of us today feel any need to put forth

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.950
a rigorous philosophical argument

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.209
as to why slavery is wrong

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.767
or public hangings or beating children.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.667
By now, these things just feel wrong.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.504
But just those arguments had to be made,

00:08:43.504 --> 00:08:46.253
and they were, in centuries past.

00:08:46.253 --> 00:08:48.005
SP: Are you saying that people needed

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:50.053
a step-by-step argument to grasp

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:52.112
why something might be a wee bit wrong

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:53.890
with burning heretics at the stake?

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.807
RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:59.729
Sebastian Castellio making the case.

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:01.744
Sebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,

00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:03.384
and other sects say that they are.

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:04.657
Who shall be judge?

00:09:04.657 --> 00:09:07.095
If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:10.114
But then, why does he write so
many books about manifest truth?

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:12.650
In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.414
simply as one with whom we disagree.

00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:16.386
And if then we are going to kill heretics,

00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:18.627
the logical outcome will be a war of extermination,

00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:20.498
since each is sure of himself.

00:09:20.498 --> 00:09:22.047
SP: Or with hideous punishments

00:09:22.047 --> 00:09:23.890
like breaking on the wheel?

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.398
RNG: The prohibition in our constitution

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.430
of cruel and unusual punishments

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.011
was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764

00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:35.530
by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.881
Cesare Beccaria: As punishments
become more cruel,

00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:39.964
the minds of men, which like fluids

00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:41.923
always adjust to the level of the objects

00:09:41.923 --> 00:09:43.802
that surround them, become hardened,

00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:46.647
and after a hundred years of cruel punishments,

00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:48.839
breaking on the wheel causes no more fear

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.983
than imprisonment previously did.

00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:53.030
For a punishment to achieve its objective,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.770
it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.829
outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.937
and into this calculation ought to be factored

00:10:00.937 --> 00:10:02.603
the certainty of punishment

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.741
and the loss of the good

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.376
that the commission of the crime will produce.

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:08.168
Everything beyond this is superfluous,

00:10:08.168 --> 00:10:10.119
and therefore tyrannical.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:12.469
SP: But surely antiwar movements depended

00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:13.998
on mass demonstrations

00:10:13.998 --> 00:10:16.080
and catchy tunes by folk singers

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.987
and wrenching photographs
of the human costs of war.

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:22.165
RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.858
reach back to a long chain of thinkers

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.446
who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize

00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:29.685
our emotions against war,

00:10:29.685 --> 00:10:32.812
such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.

00:10:32.812 --> 00:10:34.669
Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:36.334
diffuse themselves far and wide,

00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:38.233
and reach great numbers,

00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:40.234
while in war, if anything turns out happily,

00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:42.458
the advantage redounds only to a few,

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.469
and those unworthy of reaping it.

00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:47.346
One man's safety is owing
to the destruction of another.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.015
One man's prize is derived
from the plunder of another.

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:52.182
The cause of rejoicings made by one side

00:10:52.182 --> 00:10:54.530
is to the other a cause of mourning.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.071
Whatever is unfortunate in war,

00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.731
is severely so indeed,

00:10:57.731 --> 00:10:59.133
and whatever, on the contrary,

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.422
is called good fortune,

00:11:00.422 --> 00:11:02.341
is a savage and a cruel good fortune,

00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:05.978
an ungenerous happiness deriving
its existence from another's woe.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:07.835
SP: But everyone knows that the movement

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:11.053
to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.

00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:13.303
It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:16.638
and it only became popular when
Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel

00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:18.922
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.

00:11:18.922 --> 00:11:21.839
RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.077
John Locke bucked the tide of millennia

00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:28.502
that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.

00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:31.076
He argued that it was inconsistent

00:11:31.076 --> 00:11:32.998
with the principles of rational government.

00:11:32.998 --> 00:11:34.643
John Locke: Freedom of men under government

00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:36.662
is to have a standing rule to live by

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.715
common to everyone of that society

00:11:38.715 --> 00:11:41.787
and made by the legislative power erected in it,

00:11:41.787 --> 00:11:43.971
a liberty to follow my own will in all things

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:45.691
where that rule prescribes not,

00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:47.602
not to be subject to the inconstant,

00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:51.009
uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.608
as freedom of nature is to
be under no other restraint

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:55.558
but the law of nature.

00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:57.350
SP: Those words sound familiar.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.076
Where have I read them before? Ah, yes.

00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:02.819
Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty 
be not necessary

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:05.431
in a state, how comes it to be so in a family?

00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:08.411
Or if in a family, why not in a state?

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:10.279
Since no reason can be alleged for the one

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.387
that will not hold more strongly for the other,

00:12:12.387 --> 00:12:13.820
if all men are born free,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.209
how is it that all women are born slaves,

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:18.637
as they must be if being subjected

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.675
to the inconstant, uncertain,

00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:23.195
unknown, arbitrary will of men

00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:26.095
be the perfect condition of slavery?

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:28.028
RNG: That sort of co-option

00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:30.594
is all in the job description of reason.

00:12:30.594 --> 00:12:32.769
One movement for the expansion of rights

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:36.659
inspires another because the logic is the same,

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:38.558
and once that's hammered home,

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.092
it becomes increasingly uncomfortable

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:43.286
to ignore the inconsistency.

00:12:43.286 --> 00:12:46.081
In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement

00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:47.999
inspired the movements for women's rights,

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.622
children's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.

00:12:51.622 --> 00:12:54.044
But fully two centuries before,

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:56.192
the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.894
had exposed the indefensibility

00:12:58.894 --> 00:13:01.336
of customary practices such as

00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:03.439
the cruelty to animals.

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:05.819
Jeremy Bentham: The question
is not, can they reason,

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:09.212
nor can they talk, but can they suffer?

00:13:09.212 --> 00:13:12.056
RNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.

00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:14.024
JB: As to any primary mischief,

00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:17.281
it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.

00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:19.531
On the contrary, it produces pleasure.

00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:21.061
The partners are both willing.

00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:22.605
If either of them be unwilling,

00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:23.963
the act is an offense,

00:13:23.963 --> 00:13:26.172
totally different in its nature of effects.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.784
It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:31.028
As to the any danger exclusive of pain,

00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:32.740
the danger, if any, much consist

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.579
in the tendency of the example.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:37.713
But what is the tendency of this example?

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:39.985
To dispose others to engage in the same practices.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.679
But this practice produces not pain of any kind

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:44.313
to anyone.

00:13:44.313 --> 00:13:46.779
SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:48.638
for the arguments of these great thinkers

00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:52.043
to trickle down and infiltrate
the population as a whole.

00:13:52.043 --> 00:13:54.522
It kind of makes you wonder about our own time.

00:13:54.522 --> 00:13:56.491
Are there practices that we engage in

00:13:56.491 --> 00:13:59.286
where the arguments against
them are there for all to see

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:01.575
but nonetheless we persist in them?

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:04.567
RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,

00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:07.782
will they be as appalled by some of our practices

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:11.441
as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,

00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.529
wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:17.321
SP: I'm sure everyone here
could think of an example.

00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:19.351
RNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals

00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:21.062
in factory farms.

00:14:21.062 --> 00:14:23.292
SP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:25.994
and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.

00:14:25.994 --> 00:14:28.719
RNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:30.376
in the developing world.

00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:32.718
SP: The possession of nuclear weapons.

00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:35.095
RNG: The appeal to religion to justify

00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.735
the otherwise unjustifiable,

00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:39.247
such as the ban on contraception.

00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:41.035
SP: What about religious faith in general?

00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:43.216
RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.273
SP: Still, I have become convinced

00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:46.984
that reason is a better angel

00:14:46.984 --> 00:14:48.556
that deserves the greatest credit

00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:51.210
for the moral progress our species has enjoyed

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.325
and that holds out the greatest hope

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:56.141
for continuing moral progress in the future.

00:14:56.141 --> 00:14:58.043
RNG: And if, our friends,

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.723
you detect a flaw in this argument,

00:15:00.723 --> 00:15:04.045
just remember you'll be depending on reason

00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:05.416
to point it out.

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:08.130
Thank you.
SP: Thank you.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:15.125
(Applause)
