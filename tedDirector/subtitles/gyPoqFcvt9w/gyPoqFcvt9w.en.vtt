00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:15.284
[This talk contains graphic language
and descriptions of sexual violence

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:16.689
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:19.669
Tom Stranger: In 1996,
when I was 18 years old,

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:23.300
I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:27.612
Ironically I'm an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather,

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:32.495
so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland,

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.742
after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:39.728
I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:41.153
who took me hiking,

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:44.268
and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.021
I struggled a bit with the initial
period of homesickness.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:50.043
I snowboarded after school,

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.430
and I slept a lot.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.238
Two hours of chemistry class in a language
that you don't yet fully understand

00:00:56.262 --> 00:00:58.044
can be a pretty good sedative.

00:00:58.068 --> 00:00:59.218
(Laughter)

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.980
My teacher recommended
I try out for the school play,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.334
just to get me a bit more socially active.

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:08.415
It turns out I didn't end up
being part of the play,

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.346
but through it I met Thordis.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.334
We shared a lovely teenage romance,

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:15.852
and we'd meet at lunchtimes
to just hold hands

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.022
and walk around old downtown ReykjavÃ­k.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:21.737
I met her welcoming family,
and she met my friends.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:25.269
We'd been in a budding relationship
for a bit over a month

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.540
when our school's Christmas Ball was held.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:33.156
Thordis Elva: I was 16
and in love for the first time.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.414
Going together to the Christmas dance

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:38.235
was a public confirmation
of our relationship,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.226
and I felt like the luckiest
girl in the world.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.827
No longer a child, but a young woman.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.463
High on my newfound maturity,

00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:50.847
I felt it was only natural to try drinking
rum for the first time that night, too.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:53.378
That was a bad idea.

00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:54.890
I became very ill,

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.734
drifting in and out of consciousness

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:59.883
in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:02.871
The security guards wanted
to call me an ambulance,

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.884
but Tom acted as my knight
in shining armor,

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:07.943
and told them he'd take me home.

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:10.303
It was like a fairy tale,

00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:12.103
his strong arms around me,

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.418
laying me in the safety of my bed.

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:19.949
But the gratitude that I felt
towards him soon turned to horror

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.431
as he proceeded to take off my clothes
and get on top of me.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:26.613
My head had cleared up,

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:29.764
but my body was still
too weak to fight back,

00:02:29.788 --> 00:02:32.122
and the pain was blinding.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.668
I thought I'd be severed in two.

00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:37.199
In order to stay sane,

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.497
I silently counted the seconds
on my alarm clock.

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:43.177
And ever since that night,

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:48.975
I've known that there are 7,200
seconds in two hours.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.198
Despite limping for days
and crying for weeks,

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:58.628
this incident didn't fit my ideas
about rape like I'd seen on TV.

00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:01.202
Tom wasn't an armed lunatic;

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:02.989
he was my boyfriend.

00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:05.622
And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.707
it happened in my own bed.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:12.172
By the time I could identify
what had happened to me as rape,

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:14.187
he had completed his exchange program

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:15.766
and left for Australia.

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.995
So I told myself it was pointless
to address what had happened.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.204
And besides,

00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:23.823
it had to have been my fault, somehow.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:26.810
I was raised in a world
where girls are taught

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.996
that they get raped for a reason.

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:32.169
Their skirt was too short,

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:34.687
their smile was too wide,

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:37.129
their breath smelled of alcohol.

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:40.603
And I was guilty of all of those things,

00:03:40.627 --> 00:03:42.677
so the shame had to be mine.

00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:44.919
It took me years to realize

00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:48.854
that only one thing could have stopped me
from being raped that night,

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.020
and it wasn't my skirt,

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:52.994
it wasn't my smile,

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.214
it wasn't my childish trust.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.386
The only thing that could've stopped me
from being raped that night

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.460
is the man who raped me --

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.497
had he stopped himself.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.660
TS: I have vague memories of the next day:

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.850
the after effects of drinking,

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:12.663
a certain hollowness
that I tried to stifle.

00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:14.665
Nothing more.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:17.856
But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.035
It is important to now state

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.559
that I didn't see my deed for what it was.

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:27.526
The word "rape" didn't echo
around my mind as it should've,

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:31.754
and I wasn't crucifying myself
with memories of the night before.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:35.718
It wasn't so much a conscious refusal,

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:39.101
it was more like any acknowledgment
of reality was forbidden.

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:44.299
My definition of my actions completely
refuted any recognition

00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:46.600
of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:49.677
To be honest,

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:53.795
I repudiated the entire act
in the days afterwards

00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:56.098
and when I was committing it.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.772
I disavowed the truth by convincing
myself it was sex and not rape.

00:05:02.608 --> 00:05:06.474
And this is a lie I've felt
spine-bending guilt for.

00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:10.241
I broke up with Thordis
a couple of days later,

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:11.909
and then saw her a number of times

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:13.991
during the remainder
of my year in Iceland,

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:16.908
feeling a sharp stab
of heavyheartedness each time.

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:22.096
Deep down, I knew I'd done
something immeasurably wrong.

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:26.169
But without planning it,
I sunk the memories deep,

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.974
and then I tied a rock to them.

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:31.781
What followed is a nine-year period

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:34.943
that can best be titled
as "Denial and Running."

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.309
When I got a chance to identify
the real torment that I caused,

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:42.576
I didn't stand still long enough to do so.

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:45.979
Whether it be via distraction,

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:47.479
substance use,

00:05:47.503 --> 00:05:49.121
thrill-seeking

00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:52.494
or the scrupulous policing
of my inner speak,

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.787
I refused to be static and silent.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:58.207
And with this noise,

00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:01.200
I also drew heavily
upon other parts of my life

00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:03.395
to construct a picture of who I was.

00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:05.686
I was a surfer,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.427
a social science student,

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:09.537
a friend to good people,

00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:11.819
a loved brother and son,

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:13.395
an outdoor recreation guide,

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.982
and eventually, a youth worker.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.941
I gripped tight to the simple notion
that I wasn't a bad person.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.360
I didn't think I had this in my bones.

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.019
I thought I was made up of something else.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.988
In my nurtured upbringing,

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:30.358
my loving extended family and role models,

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:33.341
people close to me were warm and genuine

00:06:33.365 --> 00:06:35.260
in their respect shown towards women.

00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:41.363
It took me a long time to stare down
this dark corner of myself,

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:43.021
and to ask it questions.

00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:48.026
TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.531
I was 25 years old,

00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:52.122
and headed straight
for a nervous breakdown.

00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:56.542
My self-worth was buried
under a soul-crushing load of silence

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.858
that isolated me from everyone
that I cared about,

00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:02.787
and I was consumed
with misplaced hatred and anger

00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.575
that I took out on myself.

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:08.065
One day, I stormed out
of the door in tears

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.032
after a fight with a loved one,

00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:11.755
and I wandered into a cafÃ©,

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.861
where I asked the waitress for a pen.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.314
I always had a notebook with me,

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:20.071
claiming that it was to jot down ideas
in moments of inspiration,

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:24.325
but the truth was that I needed
to be constantly fidgeting,

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.236
because in moments of stillness,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.905
I found myself counting seconds again.

00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:34.900
But that day, I watched in wonder
as the words streamed out of my pen,

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:37.985
forming the most pivotal letter
I've ever written,

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.543
addressed to Tom.

00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:43.655
Along with an account of the violence
that he subjected me to,

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:46.862
the words, "I want to find forgiveness"

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.370
stared back at me,

00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:50.809
surprising nobody more than myself.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.086
But deep down I realized that this
was my way out of my suffering,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.147
because regardless of whether or not
he deserved my forgiveness,

00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:02.657
I deserved peace.

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:06.167
My era of shame was over.

00:08:07.992 --> 00:08:09.491
Before sending the letter,

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:12.262
I prepared myself for all kinds
of negative responses,

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:16.033
or what I found likeliest:
no response whatsoever.

00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:19.783
The only outcome
that I didn't prepare myself for

00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:22.036
was the one that I then got --

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.971
a typed confession from Tom,
full of disarming regret.

00:08:27.438 --> 00:08:31.525
As it turns out, he, too,
had been imprisoned by silence.

00:08:32.174 --> 00:08:36.224
And this marked the start
of an eight-year-long correspondence

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.672
that God knows was never easy,

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.864
but always honest.

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.124
I relieved myself of the burdens
that I'd wrongfully shouldered,

00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:48.556
and he, in turn, wholeheartedly
owned up to what he'd done.

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:51.507
Our written exchanges became a platform

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.248
to dissect the consequences of that night,

00:08:54.272 --> 00:08:56.467
and they were everything
from gut-wrenching

00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:59.045
to healing beyond words.

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:03.369
And yet, it didn't bring about
closure for me.

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:07.660
Perhaps because the email format
didn't feel personal enough,

00:09:07.684 --> 00:09:09.595
perhaps because it's easy to be brave

00:09:09.619 --> 00:09:13.727
when you're hiding behind a computer
screen on the other side of the planet.

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:15.537
But we'd begun a dialogue

00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:19.327
that I felt was necessary
to explore to its fullest.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.957
So, after eight years of writing,

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:25.687
and nearly 16 years after that dire night,

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29.542
I mustered the courage
to propose a wild idea:

00:09:29.566 --> 00:09:31.226
that we'd meet up in person

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.081
and face our past once and for all.

00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:40.184
TS: Iceland and Australia
are geographically like this.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.317
In the middle of the two is South Africa.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:46.771
We decided upon the city of Cape Town,

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.839
and there we met for one week.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:53.716
The city itself proved to be
a stunningly powerful environment

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.624
to focus on reconciliation
and forgiveness.

00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:00.306
Nowhere else has healing
and rapprochement been tested

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.964
like it has in South Africa.

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:06.723
As a nation, South Africa sought
to sit within the truth of its past,

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:09.150
and to listen to the details
of its history.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:14.388
Knowing this only magnified the effect
that Cape Town had on us.

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:17.288
Over the course of this week,

00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:20.202
we literally spoke
our life stories to each other,

00:10:20.226 --> 00:10:21.816
from start to finish.

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:25.625
And this was about analyzing
our own history.

00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:30.221
We followed a strict policy
of being honest,

00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:33.170
and this also came
with a certain exposure,

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:35.100
an open-chested vulnerability.

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:38.259
There were gutting confessions,

00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:41.107
and moments where we just
absolutely couldn't fathom

00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:42.939
the other person's experience.

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:48.972
The seismic effects of sexual violence
were spoken aloud and felt,

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:50.326
face to face.

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:53.302
At other times, though,

00:10:53.326 --> 00:10:55.960
we found a soaring clarity,

00:10:56.984 --> 00:11:01.384
and even some totally unexpected
but liberating laughter.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.600
When it came down to it,

00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:08.252
we did out best to listen
to each other intently.

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:15.065
And our individual realities
were aired with an unfiltered purity

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:17.465
that couldn't do any less
than lighten the soul.

00:11:20.328 --> 00:11:24.373
TE: Wanting to take revenge
is a very human emotion --

00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:26.035
instinctual, even.

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:28.660
And all I wanted to do for years

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:32.653
was to hurt Tom back as deeply
as he had hurt me.

00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:36.531
But had I not found a way
out of the hatred and anger,

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:38.720
I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.

00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:43.805
That isn't to say that I didn't have
my doubts along the way.

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:48.170
When the plane bounced
on that landing strip in Cape Town,

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:49.797
I remember thinking,

00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:54.027
"Why did I not just get myself
a therapist and a bottle of vodka

00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:56.267
like a normal person would do?"

00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:59.211
(Laughter)

00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:02.440
At times, our search
for understanding in Cape Town

00:12:02.464 --> 00:12:04.631
felt like an impossible quest,

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:06.754
and all I wanted to do was to give up

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:08.994
and go home to my loving
husband, Vidir,

00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:10.229
and our son.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.177
But despite our difficulties,

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.829
this journey did result
in a victorious feeling

00:12:18.853 --> 00:12:21.986
that light had triumphed over darkness,

00:12:22.632 --> 00:12:26.944
that something constructive
could be built out of the ruins.

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:29.717
I read somewhere

00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:33.602
that you should try and be the person
that you needed when you were younger.

00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:35.210
And back when I was a teenager,

00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:39.082
I would have needed to know
that the shame wasn't mine,

00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:41.620
that there's hope after rape,

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.239
that you can even find happiness,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.153
like I share with my husband today.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:50.036
Which is why I started writing feverishly
upon my return from Cape Town,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.784
resulting in a book co-authored by Tom,

00:12:52.808 --> 00:12:55.993
that we hope can be of use
to people from both ends

00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:58.321
of the perpetrator-survivor scale.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.454
If nothing else,

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:04.613
it's a story that we would've needed
to hear when we were younger.

00:13:06.546 --> 00:13:08.367
Given the nature of our story,

00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.167
I know the words
that inevitably accompany it --

00:13:11.753 --> 00:13:14.309
victim, rapist --

00:13:14.333 --> 00:13:16.588
and labels are a way to organize concepts,

00:13:16.612 --> 00:13:20.994
but they can also be dehumanizing
in their connotations.

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:23.758
Once someone's been deemed a victim,

00:13:23.782 --> 00:13:29.015
it's that much easier to file them away
as someone damaged,

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:30.545
dishonored,

00:13:30.569 --> 00:13:31.844
less than.

00:13:32.463 --> 00:13:35.183
And likewise, once someone
has been branded a rapist,

00:13:35.207 --> 00:13:37.753
it's that much easier
to call him a monster --

00:13:38.396 --> 00:13:39.695
inhuman.

00:13:40.434 --> 00:13:43.465
But how will we understand
what it is in human societies

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.070
that produces violence

00:13:45.094 --> 00:13:49.573
if we refuse to recognize
the humanity of those who commit it?

00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:51.518
And how --

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:53.721
(Applause)

00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:59.113
And how can we empower survivors
if we're making them feel less than?

00:13:59.892 --> 00:14:03.319
How can we discuss solutions
to one of the biggest threats

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.617
to the lives of women and children
around the world,

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:10.464
if the very words we use
are part of the problem?

00:14:13.606 --> 00:14:16.098
TS: From what I've now learnt,

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:20.695
my actions that night in 1996
were a self-centered taking.

00:14:21.848 --> 00:14:23.971
I felt deserving of Thordis's body.

00:14:25.563 --> 00:14:28.428
I've had primarily positive
social influences

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.993
and examples of equitable
behavior around me.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.847
But on that occasion,

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.975
I chose to draw upon the negative ones.

00:14:35.536 --> 00:14:38.432
The ones that see women
as having less intrinsic worth,

00:14:39.507 --> 00:14:43.918
and of men having some unspoken
and symbolic claim to their bodies.

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:48.610
These influences I speak of
are external to me, though.

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:52.183
And it was only me in that room
making choices,

00:14:52.207 --> 00:14:53.435
nobody else.

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:56.574
When you own something

00:14:56.598 --> 00:14:59.216
and really square up to your culpability,

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:02.402
I do think a surprising thing can happen.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.376
It's what I call a paradox of ownership.

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:09.601
I thought I'd buckle
under the weight of responsibility.

00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:13.080
I thought my certificate
of humanity would be burnt.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:18.042
Instead, I was offered
to really own what I did,

00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:22.228
and found that it didn't possess
the entirety of who I am.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.641
Put simply,

00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:29.181
something you've done doesn't have
to constitute the sum of who you are.

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:32.137
The noise in my head abated.

00:15:32.771 --> 00:15:36.799
The indulgent self-pity
was starved of oxygen,

00:15:36.823 --> 00:15:41.296
and it was replaced
with the clean air of acceptance --

00:15:42.478 --> 00:15:46.762
an acceptance that I did hurt
this wonderful person standing next to me;

00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:52.385
an acceptance that I am part of a large
and shockingly everyday grouping of men

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:55.091
who have been sexually violent
toward their partners.

00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:59.160
Don't underestimate the power of words.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:04.833
Saying to Thordis that I raped her
changed my accord with myself,

00:16:04.857 --> 00:16:06.117
as well as with her.

00:16:07.337 --> 00:16:08.809
But most importantly,

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:11.909
the blame transferred from Thordis to me.

00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:14.302
Far too often,

00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:18.910
the responsibility is attributed
to female survivors of sexual violence,

00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.445
and not to the males who enact it.

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:23.706
Far too often,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.812
the denial and running leaves all parties
at a great distance from the truth.

00:16:30.804 --> 00:16:33.584
There's definitely a public
conversation happening now,

00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:36.370
and like a lot of people,

00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:38.984
we're heartened
that there's less retreating

00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:41.728
from this difficult
but important discussion.

00:16:42.848 --> 00:16:46.486
I feel a real responsibility
to add our voices to it.

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:54.551
TE: What we did is not a formula
that we're prescribing for others.

00:16:55.002 --> 00:17:00.535
Nobody has the right to tell anyone else
how to handle their deepest pain

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.304
or their greatest error.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:05.507
Breaking your silence is never easy,

00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:07.745
and depending on where
you are in the world,

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:10.981
it can even be deadly
to speak out about rape.

00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:15.974
I realize that even the most
traumatic event of my life

00:17:15.998 --> 00:17:18.757
is still a testament to my privilege,

00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:22.011
because I can talk about it
without getting ostracized,

00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:23.383
or even killed.

00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:27.042
But with that privilege of having a voice

00:17:27.066 --> 00:17:29.924
comes the responsibility of using it.

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:35.083
That's the least I owe
my fellow survivors who can't.

00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:39.727
The story we've just relayed is unique,

00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:44.417
and yet it is so common with sexual
violence being a global pandemic.

00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:46.846
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:50.577
One of the things that I found useful
on my own healing journey

00:17:50.601 --> 00:17:53.249
is educating myself about sexual violence.

00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:55.687
And as a result,
I've been reading, writing

00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.364
and speaking about this issue
for over a decade now,

00:17:58.388 --> 00:18:00.940
going to conferences around the world.

00:18:00.964 --> 00:18:02.943
And in my experience,

00:18:02.967 --> 00:18:07.598
the attendees of such events
are almost exclusively women.

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:15.449
But it's about time that we stop treating
sexual violence as a women's issue.

00:18:15.473 --> 00:18:20.920
(Applause)

00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:32.933
A majority of sexual violence
against women and men

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:34.840
is perpetrated by men.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:39.272
And yet their voices are sorely
underrepresented in this discussion.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:44.563
But all of us are needed here.

00:18:45.564 --> 00:18:49.449
Just imagine all the suffering
we could alleviate

00:18:49.473 --> 00:18:53.407
if we dared to face this issue together.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.858
Thank you.

00:18:55.882 --> 00:19:00.149
(Applause)
