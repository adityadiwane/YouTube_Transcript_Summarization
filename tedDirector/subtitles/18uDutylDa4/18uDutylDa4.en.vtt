00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.601
So for any of us in this room today,
let's start out by admitting we're lucky.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.452
We don't live in the world
our mothers lived in,

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:24.715
our grandmothers lived in,

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.227
where career choices
for women were so limited.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.236
And if you're in this room today,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.004
most of us grew up in a world
where we have basic civil rights,

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:37.951
and amazingly, we still live in a world
where some women don't have them.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:41.346
But all that aside,
we still have a problem,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.585
and it's a real problem.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.236
And the problem is this:

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.432
Women are not making it
to the top of any profession

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:49.828
anywhere in the world.

00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:52.787
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.849
190 heads of state --
nine are women.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.726
Of all the people
in parliament in the world,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.599
13 percent are women.

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:03.902
In the corporate sector, women at the top,

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:06.236
C-level jobs, board seats --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.001
tops out at 15, 16 percent.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.977
The numbers have not moved since 2002

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.950
and are going in the wrong direction.

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.604
And even in the non-profit world,

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:19.900
a world we sometimes think of
as being led by more women,

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:22.236
women at the top: 20 percent.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.700
We also have another problem,

00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:27.114
which is that women face harder choices

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:30.236
between professional success
and personal fulfillment.

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:35.781
A recent study in the U.S.
showed that, of married senior managers,

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.236
two-thirds of the married men had children

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.966
and only one-third
of the married women had children.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.939
A couple of years ago, I was in New York,

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:45.419
and I was pitching a deal,

00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:48.794
and I was in one of those fancy
New York private equity offices

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:49.991
you can picture.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:52.825
And I'm in the meeting --
it's about a three-hour meeting --

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.008
and two hours in,
there needs to be that bio break,

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.839
and everyone stands up,

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:01.149
and the partner running the meeting
starts looking really embarrassed.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.794
And I realized he doesn't know
where the women's room is in his office.

00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:08.361
So I start looking
around for moving boxes,

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:10.671
figuring they just moved in,
but I don't see any.

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:13.639
And so I said, "Did you just
move into this office?"

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.259
And he said, "No,
we've been here about a year."

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.990
And I said, "Are you telling me
that I am the only woman

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:23.796
to have pitched a deal
in this office in a year?"

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.846
And he looked at me, and he said,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.451
"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one
who had to go to the bathroom."

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:31.874
(Laughter)

00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:35.367
So the question is,
how are we going to fix this?

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:40.119
How do we change these numbers at the top?

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.236
How do we make this different?

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.516
I want to start out by saying,
I talk about this --

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.236
about keeping women in the workforce --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.849
because I really think that's the answer.

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:53.135
In the high-income part of our workforce,

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.236
in the people who end up at the top --

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.236
Fortune 500 CEO jobs,
or the equivalent in other industries --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.907
the problem, I am convinced,
is that women are dropping out.

00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:06.236
Now people talk about this a lot,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.274
and they talk about things
like flextime and mentoring

00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:11.783
and programs companies
should have to train women.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.712
I want to talk about none of that today,

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.738
even though that's all really important.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.588
Today I want to focus
on what we can do as individuals.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:21.236
What are the messages
we need to tell ourselves?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.424
What are the messages we tell
the women that work with and for us?

00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:26.533
What are the messages
we tell our daughters?

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:29.300
Now, at the outset,
I want to be very clear

00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:31.406
that this speech comes with no judgments.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.010
I don't have the right answer.

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:34.561
I don't even have it for myself.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.236
I left San Francisco,
where I live, on Monday,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.026
and I was getting on the plane
for this conference.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.146
And my daughter, who's three,
when I dropped her off at preschool,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.837
did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying,
"Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.683
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.

00:03:50.707 --> 00:03:52.236
I know no women,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.070
whether they're at home
or whether they're in the workforce,

00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:56.633
who don't feel that sometimes.

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:59.236
So I'm not saying
that staying in the workforce

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.085
is the right thing for everyone.

00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:04.236
My talk today is about
what the messages are

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.617
if you do want to stay in the workforce,

00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.236
and I think there are three.

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.763
One, sit at the table.

00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:13.574
Two, make your partner a real partner.

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:18.236
And three, don't leave before you leave.

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:20.518
Number one: sit at the table.

00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:22.939
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.236
we hosted a very senior
government official,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.481
and he came in to meet with senior execs

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.106
from around Silicon Valley.

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.796
And everyone kind of sat at the table.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.392
He had these two women
who were traveling with him

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:37.236
pretty senior in his department,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.546
and I kind of said to them,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.784
"Sit at the table.
Come on, sit at the table,"

00:04:40.808 --> 00:04:42.571
and they sat on the side of the room.

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.745
When I was in college, my senior year,

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:48.268
I took a course called
European Intellectual History.

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:50.499
Don't you love that kind
of thing from college?

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.236
I wish I could do that now.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.236
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.800
who was then a brilliant
literary student --

00:04:56.824 --> 00:04:59.134
and went on to be a brilliant
literary scholar --

00:04:59.158 --> 00:05:01.175
and my brother -- smart guy,

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.814
but a water-polo-playing pre-med,

00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:04.236
who was a sophomore.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.236
The three of us take this class together.

00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:10.994
And then Carrie reads all the books
in the original Greek and Latin,

00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:12.710
goes to all the lectures.

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.784
I read all the books in English

00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:16.465
and go to most of the lectures.

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.236
My brother is kind of busy.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.972
He reads one book of 12
and goes to a couple of lectures,

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:25.043
marches himself up to our room

00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:27.544
a couple days before the exam
to get himself tutored.

00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:30.798
The three of us go to the exam
together, and we sit down.

00:05:30.822 --> 00:05:32.981
And we sit there for three hours --

00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:35.386
and our little blue notebooks
-- yes, I'm that old.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.625
We walk out, we look at each other,
and we say, "How did you do?"

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:42.126
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like
I didn't really draw out the main point

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.725
on the Hegelian dialectic."

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.674
And I say, "God, I really
wish I had really connected

00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:49.913
John Locke's theory of property
with the philosophers that follow."

00:05:49.937 --> 00:05:51.441
And my brother says,

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:53.380
"I got the top grade in the class."

00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:55.349
(Laughter)

00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:57.469
"You got the top grade in the class?

00:05:57.493 --> 00:05:59.043
You don't know anything."

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.467
(Laughter)

00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:05.039
The problem with these stories
is that they show what the data shows:

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:08.553
women systematically
underestimate their own abilities.

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.236
If you test men and women,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.854
and you ask them questions
on totally objective criteria like GPAs,

00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:15.742
men get it wrong slightly high,

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:17.853
and women get it wrong slightly low.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.236
Women do not negotiate
for themselves in the workforce.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.236
A study in the last two years

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.877
of people entering
the workforce out of college

00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.236
showed that 57 percent
of boys entering, or men, I guess,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.661
are negotiating their first salary,

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.763
and only seven percent of women.

00:06:35.397 --> 00:06:37.516
And most importantly,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.236
men attribute their success to themselves,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.914
and women attribute it
to other external factors.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.633
If you ask men why they did a good job,

00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:48.236
they'll say, "I'm awesome.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.236
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.236
If you ask women why they did a good job,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.236
what they'll say is someone helped them,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.236
they got lucky, they worked really hard.

00:06:57.906 --> 00:06:59.236
Why does this matter?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.236
Boy, it matters a lot.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.236
Because no one gets to the corner office

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.814
by sitting on the side, not at the table,

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:08.841
and no one gets the promotion

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.420
if they don't think
they deserve their success,

00:07:11.444 --> 00:07:14.236
or they don't even understand
their own success.

00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:16.876
I wish the answer were easy.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.512
I wish I could go tell
all the young women I work for,

00:07:19.536 --> 00:07:20.550
these fabulous women,

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:22.824
"Believe in yourself
and negotiate for yourself.

00:07:22.848 --> 00:07:24.236
Own your own success."

00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:26.662
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.865
But it's not that simple.

00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:32.740
Because what the data shows,
above all else, is one thing,

00:07:32.764 --> 00:07:37.065
which is that success and likeability
are positively correlated for men

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.075
and negatively correlated for women.

00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:43.115
And everyone's nodding,
because we all know this to be true.

00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:46.236
There's a really good study
that shows this really well.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.451
There's a famous Harvard
Business School study

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:50.108
on a woman named Heidi Roizen.

00:07:50.132 --> 00:07:54.536
And she's an operator
in a company in Silicon Valley,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.236
and she uses her contacts

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.796
to become a very successful
venture capitalist.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.236
In 2002 -- not so long ago --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.499
a professor who was then
at Columbia University

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:05.906
took that case
and made it [Howard] Roizen.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.763
And he gave the case out, both of them,
to two groups of students.

00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:12.719
He changed exactly one word:

00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:14.236
"Heidi" to "Howard."

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.236
But that one word made
a really big difference.

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:19.438
He then surveyed the students,

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:22.128
and the good news was the students,
both men and women,

00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:24.546
thought Heidi and Howard
were equally competent,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.848
and that's good.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.943
The bad news was
that everyone liked Howard.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.967
He's a great guy.
You want to work for him.

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:32.991
You want to spend the day
fishing with him.

00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:34.577
But Heidi? Not so sure.

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.466
She's a little out for herself.
She's a little political.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.537
You're not sure
you'd want to work for her.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.885
This is the complication.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.570
We have to tell our daughters
and our colleagues,

00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:47.278
we have to tell ourselves
to believe we got the A,

00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:50.236
to reach for the promotion,
to sit at the table,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.039
and we have to do it in a world

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:55.658
where, for them, there are sacrifices
they will make for that,

00:08:55.682 --> 00:08:57.969
even though for their brothers,
there are not.

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:02.744
The saddest thing about all of this
is that it's really hard to remember this.

00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:05.816
And I'm about to tell a story
which is truly embarrassing for me,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.147
but I think important.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.727
I gave this talk at Facebook
not so long ago

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:13.240
to about 100 employees,

00:09:13.264 --> 00:09:16.312
and a couple hours later,
there was a young woman who works there

00:09:16.336 --> 00:09:19.675
sitting outside my little desk,
and she wanted to talk to me.

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.842
I said, okay, and she sat down,
and we talked.

00:09:21.866 --> 00:09:23.819
And she said, "I learned something today.

00:09:23.843 --> 00:09:25.898
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:27.271
"What do you mean?"

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:29.089
She said, "You're giving this talk,

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:31.410
and you said you would take
two more questions.

00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:33.514
I had my hand up with many other people,

00:09:33.538 --> 00:09:35.133
and you took two more questions.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:38.067
I put my hand down, and I noticed
all the women did the same,

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:40.020
and then you took more questions,

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:41.236
only from the men."

00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:43.707
And I thought to myself,

00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:46.536
"Wow, if it's me -- who cares
about this, obviously --

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.494
giving this talk --

00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:54.236
and during this talk, I can't even notice
that the men's hands are still raised,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.236
and the women's hands are still raised,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.438
how good are we

00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:00.166
as managers of our companies
and our organizations

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.715
at seeing that the men
are reaching for opportunities

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:03.786
more than women?"

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.927
We've got to get women
to sit at the table.

00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:07.952
(Cheers)

00:10:07.976 --> 00:10:11.184
(Applause)

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:12.531
Message number two:

00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:14.442
Make your partner a real partner.

00:10:14.466 --> 00:10:17.657
I've become convinced that we've made
more progress in the workforce

00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:19.236
than we have in the home.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.471
The data shows this very clearly.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.439
If a woman and a man
work full-time and have a child,

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:29.816
the woman does twice the amount
of housework the man does,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.236
and the woman does three times
the amount of childcare the man does.

00:10:34.707 --> 00:10:38.457
So she's got three jobs
or two jobs, and he's got one.

00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:41.508
Who do you think drops out
when someone needs to be home more?

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:45.884
The causes of this are really complicated,
and I don't have time to go into them.

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:49.844
And I don't think Sunday football-watching
and general laziness is the cause.

00:10:49.868 --> 00:10:52.082
I think the cause is more complicated.

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:53.595
I think, as a society,

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.836
we put more pressure
on our boys to succeed

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.236
than we do on our girls.

00:10:57.714 --> 00:10:59.742
I know men that stay home

00:10:59.766 --> 00:11:02.833
and work in the home
to support wives with careers,

00:11:02.857 --> 00:11:03.884
and it's hard.

00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:07.236
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff
and I see the father there,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.779
I notice that the other mommies
don't play with him.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.236
And that's a problem,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.446
because we have to make it
as important a job,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.849
because it's the hardest job
in the world to work inside the home,

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.353
for people of both genders,

00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:24.871
if we're going to even things out and let
women stay in the workforce.

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.236
(Applause)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.499
Studies show that households
with equal earning

00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:30.465
and equal responsibility

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.650
also have half the divorce rate.

00:11:32.674 --> 00:11:35.858
And if that wasn't good enough motivation
for everyone out there,

00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:37.695
they also have more --

00:11:37.719 --> 00:11:39.529
how shall I say this on this stage?

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:42.236
They know each other more
in the biblical sense as well.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.753
(Cheers)

00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:46.712
Message number three:

00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:48.236
Don't leave before you leave.

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:50.542
I think there's a really deep irony

00:11:50.566 --> 00:11:52.651
to the fact that actions
women are taking --

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:54.236
and I see this all the time --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.386
with the objective
of staying in the workforce

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.975
actually lead to their eventually leaving.

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:01.236
Here's what happens:

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.804
We're all busy. Everyone's busy.
A woman's busy.

00:12:03.828 --> 00:12:06.236
And she starts thinking
about having a child,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.236
and from the moment she starts
thinking about having a child,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.784
she starts thinking
about making room for that child.

00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:15.068
"How am I going to fit this
into everything else I'm doing?"

00:12:15.442 --> 00:12:18.092
And literally from that moment,

00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:20.410
she doesn't raise her hand anymore,

00:12:20.434 --> 00:12:23.764
she doesn't look for a promotion,
she doesn't take on the new project,

00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:25.765
she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."

00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:27.063
She starts leaning back.

00:12:27.462 --> 00:12:28.859
The problem is that --

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:32.447
let's say she got pregnant
that day, that day --

00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:35.236
nine months of pregnancy,
three months of maternity leave,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.410
six months to catch your breath --

00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:38.896
Fast-forward two years,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.880
more often -- and as I've seen it --

00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:43.418
women start thinking
about this way earlier --

00:12:43.442 --> 00:12:45.332
when they get engaged, or married,

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.504
when they start thinking
about having a child,

00:12:47.528 --> 00:12:48.995
which can take a long time.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.027
One woman came to see me about this.

00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:52.780
She looked a little young.

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:56.138
And I said, "So are you and your husband
thinking about having a baby?"

00:12:56.162 --> 00:12:58.124
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."

00:12:58.148 --> 00:12:59.723
She didn't even have a boyfriend.

00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:00.748
(Laughter)

00:13:00.772 --> 00:13:04.103
I said, "You're thinking about this
just way too early."

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:07.097
But the point is that what happens

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.769
once you start
kind of quietly leaning back?

00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:12.569
Everyone who's been through this --

00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:15.336
and I'm here to tell you,
once you have a child at home,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.946
your job better be really good to go back,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.113
because it's hard to leave
that kid at home.

00:13:20.137 --> 00:13:22.001
Your job needs to be challenging.

00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:23.691
It needs to be rewarding.

00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:26.236
You need to feel like you're
making a difference.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.236
And if two years ago
you didn't take a promotion

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.526
and some guy next to you did,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.236
if three years ago you stopped
looking for new opportunities,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.988
you're going to be bored

00:13:37.012 --> 00:13:39.705
because you should have kept
your foot on the gas pedal.

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:42.867
Don't leave before you leave.

00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:44.236
Stay in.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.236
Keep your foot on the gas pedal,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.891
until the very day you need to leave
to take a break for a child --

00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:52.701
and then make your decisions.

00:13:53.156 --> 00:13:55.634
Don't make decisions too far in advance,

00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:58.376
particularly ones you're not
even conscious you're making.

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.512
My generation really, sadly,

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:03.807
is not going to change
the numbers at the top.

00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:05.551
They're just not moving.

00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:08.777
We are not going to get
to where 50 percent of the population --

00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:11.468
in my generation, there will not
be 50 percent of [women]

00:14:11.492 --> 00:14:12.999
at the top of any industry.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.551
But I'm hopeful that future
generations can.

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:22.233
I think a world where half
of our countries and our companies

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:24.670
were run by women,
would be a better world.

00:14:24.694 --> 00:14:28.075
It's not just because people would know
where the women's bathrooms are,

00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:30.752
even though that would be very helpful.

00:14:30.776 --> 00:14:32.523
I think it would be a better world.

00:14:33.503 --> 00:14:34.778
I have two children.

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:37.374
I have a five-year-old son
and a two-year-old daughter.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.497
I want my son to have a choice

00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:42.593
to contribute fully
in the workforce or at home,

00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:46.513
and I want my daughter
to have the choice to not just succeed,

00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:49.236
but to be liked for her accomplishments.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.370
Thank you.

00:14:50.394 --> 00:14:52.260
(Applause)
