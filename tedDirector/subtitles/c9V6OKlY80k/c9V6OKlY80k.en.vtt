00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.880
So, this is a story

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:16.833
about how we know what we know.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.825
It's a story about this woman,

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.547
Natalia Rybczynski.

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.960
She's a paleobiologist,

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:28.813
which means she specializes
in digging up really old dead stuff.

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:32.339
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,
I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:34.992
Latif Nasser: And I think
she's particularly interesting

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:36.930
because of where she digs that stuff up,

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:41.149
way above the Arctic Circle
in the remote Canadian tundra.

00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:44.956
Now, one summer day in 2006,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.171
she was at a dig site called
the Fyles Leaf Bed,

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:52.773
which is less than 10 degrees latitude
away from the magnetic north pole.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.524
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not
going to sound very exciting,

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:59.578
because it was a day of walking
with your backpack and your GPS

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:03.680
and notebook and just picking up
anything that might be a fossil.

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:06.379
LN: And at some point,
she noticed something.

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:08.570
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:10.529
about the size of the palm of my hand.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.847
It was just lying on the surface.

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.323
LN: And at first she thought
it was just a splinter of wood,

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.640
because that's the sort of thing
people had found

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:22.083
at the Fyles Leaf Bed before --
prehistoric plant parts.

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:24.575
But that night, back at camp ...

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.869
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,

00:01:26.893 --> 00:01:29.290
I'm looking a little bit
more closely and realizing

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:31.718
it doesn't quite look
like this has tree rings.

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:33.306
Maybe it's a preservation thing,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.604
but it looks really like ...

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.829
bone.

00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:39.742
LN: Huh. So over the next four years,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.700
she went to that spot over and over,

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:48.260
and eventually collected 30 fragments
of that exact same bone,

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:49.945
most of them really tiny.

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:54.958
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.
It fits in a small Ziploc bag.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:58.339
LN: And she tried to piece them
together like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.386
But it was challenging.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.230
(Audio) NR: It's broken up
into so many little tiny pieces,

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:07.512
I'm trying to use sand and putty,
and it's not looking good.

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:12.703
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.

00:02:12.727 --> 00:02:14.316
LN: Ooh!
NR: Yeah, right?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.780
(Laughter)

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:18.547
LN: It turns out it was way easier
to do it virtually.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.341
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical
when it all fits together.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:23.564
LN: How certain were you
that you had it right,

00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:25.733
that you had put it together
in the right way?

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:28.771
Was there a potential that you'd
put it together a different way

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.737
and have, like, a parakeet or something?

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:32.126
(Laughter)

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.790
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.
No, we got this.

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:40.083
LN: What she had, she discovered,
was a tibia, a leg bone,

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:44.107
and specifically, one that belonged
to a cloven-hoofed mammal,

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.980
so something like a cow or a sheep.

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.464
But it couldn't have been either of those.

00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:51.271
It was just too big.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:55.886
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing,
it was huge. It's a really big animal.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.768
LN: So what animal could it be?

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.871
Having hit a wall, she showed
one of the fragments

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:04.467
to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:05.751
and they had an idea.

00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:11.291
(Audio) NR: We took a saw,
and we nicked just the edge of it,

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:17.706
and there was this really interesting
smell that comes from it.

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.284
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:23.941
It was a smell that Natalia recognized

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.908
from cutting up skulls
in her gross anatomy lab:

00:03:27.932 --> 00:03:29.096
collagen.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.777
Collagen is what gives
structure to our bones.

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:33.959
And usually, after so many years,

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:35.134
it breaks down.

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:39.506
But in this case, the Arctic had acted
like a natural freezer and preserved it.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.813
Then a year or two later,
Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,

00:03:43.837 --> 00:03:47.031
and she saw that a colleague
of hers named Mike Buckley

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:52.895
was demoing this new process
that he called "collagen fingerprinting."

00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:56.927
It turns out that different species
have slightly different structures

00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.103
of collagen,

00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:00.943
so if you get a collagen profile
of an unknown bone,

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:03.161
you can compare it
to those of known species,

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:05.723
and, who knows, maybe you get a match.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.825
So she shipped him one of the fragments,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.143
FedEx.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.977
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.
It's kind of important.

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:16.254
(Laughter)

00:04:16.278 --> 00:04:17.469
LN: And he processed it,

00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:21.855
and compared it to 37 known
and modern-day mammal species.

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:23.951
And he found a match.

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:29.436
It turns out that
the 3.5 million-year-old bone

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.090
that Natalia had dug
out of the High Arctic

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.923
belonged to ...

00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.348
a camel.

00:04:37.372 --> 00:04:39.103
(Laughter)

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:43.425
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?
That's amazing -- if it's true.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.501
LN: So they tested
a bunch of the fragments,

00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:47.769
and they got the same result for each one.

00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:53.617
However, based on the size
of the bone that they found,

00:04:53.641 --> 00:05:00.004
it meant that this camel was 30 percent
larger than modern-day camels.

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.218
So this camel would have been
about nine feet tall,

00:05:03.242 --> 00:05:04.440
weighed around a ton.

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:05.515
(Audience reacts)

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.588
Yeah.

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:10.105
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.271
(Laughter)

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.714
Now, when you hear the word "camel,"

00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:20.663
what may come to mind is one of these,

00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:24.871
the Bactrian camel
of East and Central Asia.

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:28.380
But chances are the postcard image
you have in your brain

00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:31.959
is one of these, the dromedary,

00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:34.411
quintessential desert creature --

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:38.754
hangs out in sandy, hot places
like the Middle East and the Sahara,

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:40.258
has a big old hump on its back

00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:42.799
for storing water
for those long desert treks,

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:46.204
has big, broad feet to help it
tromp over sand dunes.

00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:52.930
So how on earth would one of these guys
end up in the High Arctic?

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.506
Well, scientists have known
for a long time, turns out,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.092
even before Natalia's discovery,

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:04.734
that camels are actually
originally American.

00:06:04.758 --> 00:06:10.458
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:11.941
(Laughter)

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:13.496
They started here.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.354
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years
that camels have been around,

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.537
you could only find them in North America,

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.814
around 20 different species, maybe more.

00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:28.083
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,
would they look different?

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:30.542
NR: Yeah, you're going to have
different body sizes.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.478
You'll have some with really long necks,

00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:34.747
so they're actually
functionally like giraffes.

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:38.417
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:42.025
(Audio) NR: The really primitive,
early ones would have been really small,

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:44.552
almost like rabbits.

00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:47.423
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:48.884
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.143
So those ones you probably
would not recognize.

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:53.357
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.425
(Audio) NR: I know,
wouldn't that be great?

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:56.621
(Laughter)

00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:59.304
LN: And then about three
to seven million years ago,

00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:02.136
one branch of camels
went down to South America,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.114
where they became llamas and alpacas,

00:07:05.138 --> 00:07:08.060
and another branch crossed over
the Bering Land Bridge

00:07:08.084 --> 00:07:09.520
into Asia and Africa.

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:11.965
And then around the end
of the last ice age,

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:15.088
North American camels went extinct.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.313
So, scientists knew all of that already,

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:24.413
but it still doesn't fully explain
how Natalia found one so far north.

00:07:24.437 --> 00:07:29.111
Like, this is, temperature-wise,
the polar opposite of the Sahara.

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:31.636
Now to be fair,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.343
three and a half million years ago,

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:37.466
it was on average 22 degrees Celsius
warmer than it is now.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.425
So it would have been boreal forest,

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.363
so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.

00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:48.559
But still, like, they would have
six-month-long winters

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.806
where the ponds would freeze over.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.298
You'd have blizzards.

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:55.933
You'd have 24 hours a day
of straight darkness.

00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:58.938
Like, how ... How?

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:03.120
How is it that one of these
Saharan superstars

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:06.375
could ever have survived
those arctic conditions?

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:09.375
(Laughter)

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:13.087
Natalia and her colleagues
think they have an answer.

00:08:13.632 --> 00:08:15.642
And it's kind of brilliant.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:23.233
What if the very features that we imagine
make the camel so well-suited

00:08:23.257 --> 00:08:25.225
to places like the Sahara,

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:28.661
actually evolved to help it
get through the winter?

00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:34.145
What if those broad feet were meant
to tromp not over sand,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.189
but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:40.593
What if that hump --
which, huge news to me,

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:42.991
does not contain water, it contains fat --

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:44.594
(Laughter)

00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:48.219
was there to help the camel
get through that six-month-long winter,

00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:49.920
when food was scarce?

00:08:49.944 --> 00:08:53.657
And then, only later, long after
it crossed over the land bridge

00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:58.099
did it retrofit those winter features
for a hot desert environment?

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:02.197
Like, for instance, the hump
may be helpful to camels in hotter climes

00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:04.693
because having all your fat in one place,

00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:07.458
like a, you know, fat backpack,

00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:10.010
means that you don't have
to have that insulation

00:09:10.034 --> 00:09:11.793
all over the rest of your body.

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.067
So it helps heat dissipate easier.

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.396
It's this crazy idea,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.967
that what seems like proof of the camel's
quintessential desert nature

00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:26.691
could actually be proof
of its High Arctic past.

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:31.542
Now, I'm not the first person
to tell this story.

00:09:31.566 --> 00:09:36.516
Others have told it as a way
to marvel at evolutionary biology

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.893
or as a keyhole into the future
of climate change.

00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:43.092
But I love it for a totally
different reason.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:46.513
For me, it's a story about us,

00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:48.505
about how we see the world

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:50.833
and about how that changes.

00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:55.030
So I was trained as a historian.

00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:59.307
And I've learned that, actually,
a lot of scientists are historians, too.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:00.880
They make sense of the past.

00:10:00.904 --> 00:10:06.229
They tell the history of our universe,
of our planet, of life on this planet.

00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:08.218
And as a historian,

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:12.613
you start with an idea in your mind
of how the story goes.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.681
(Audio) NR: We make up stories
and we stick with it,

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.427
like the camel in the desert, right?

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.897
That's a great story!
It's totally adapted for that.

00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.150
Clearly, it always lived there.

00:10:22.174 --> 00:10:26.476
LN: But at any moment, you could
uncover some tiny bit of evidence.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.699
You could learn some tiny thing

00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:32.682
that forces you to reframe
everything you thought you knew.

00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:36.484
Like, in this case, this one scientist
finds this one shard

00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:38.255
of what she thought was wood,

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:43.317
and because of that, science has a totally
new and totally counterintuitive theory

00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.956
about why this absurd
Dr. Seuss-looking creature

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.512
looks the way it does.

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:53.940
And for me, it completely upended
the way I think of the camel.

00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:58.346
It went from being
this ridiculously niche creature

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.719
suited only to this
one specific environment,

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:06.031
to being this world traveler
that just happens to be in the Sahara,

00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:09.180
and could end up virtually anywhere.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.855
(Applause)

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:27.854
This is Azuri.

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.469
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:34.041
OK, here, I've got
one of these for you here.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:36.111
(Laughter)

00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:40.318
So Azuri is on a break
from her regular gig

00:11:40.342 --> 00:11:42.565
at the Radio City Music Hall.

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:44.738
(Laughter)

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:46.344
That's not even a joke.

00:11:46.717 --> 00:11:48.454
Anyway --

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:52.835
But really, Azuri is here
as a living reminder

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:57.106
that the story of our world
is a dynamic one.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.837
It requires our willingness
to readjust, to reimagine.

00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:06.138
(Laughter)

00:12:06.162 --> 00:12:07.613
Right, Azuri?

00:12:07.637 --> 00:12:14.053
And, really, that we're all
just one shard of bone away

00:12:14.077 --> 00:12:16.307
from seeing the world anew.

00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:18.086
Thank you very much.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:24.531
(Applause)
