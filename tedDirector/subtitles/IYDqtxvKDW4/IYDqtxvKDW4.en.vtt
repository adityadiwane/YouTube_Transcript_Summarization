00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:16.172
The most complex problems in our time

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.142
can be solved with simple techniques,

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.729
if we are able to dream.

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:27.952
As a child, I discovered
that creativity is the key

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:32.369
to cross from dreams to reality.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.883
I learned this from my grandmother,

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:37.584
Dr. Ruth Tichauer,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.948
a Jewish refugee that settled
in the heart of the Andes.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.418
That is how I grew up:

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:49.765
encouraged to see beyond any limitation.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:54.406
So part of my education
included helping her

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.840
in remote, indigenous communities.

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:00.089
I cherish those memories,

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:05.883
because they helped me
to understand life outside the city,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.394
a life with a lot of possibilities,

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:13.283
without barriers, as language or culture.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.106
During those trips, my grandmother
used to recite a Kipling poem:

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:22.272
"Something hidden. Go and find it.

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:24.954
Go and look behind the Mountains.

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:28.733
Something lost behind the mountains.

00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:32.494
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"

00:01:33.624 --> 00:01:36.915
In the coming years,
I became a medical student.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.523
One of every hundred
children born worldwide

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:46.470
has some kind of heart disease.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:52.364
There's a part of this problem
I think I can solve --

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:58.935
the part of this problem
I have spent my life working on.

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:01.493
The problem starts

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:03.636
during pregnancy.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.617
The fetus needs to survive
inside the mother.

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:12.819
Survival depends on communication

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.260
between the systemic
and the pulmonary blood.

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:18.336
At the moment of birth,

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.307
this communication needs to stop.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:26.572
If it doesn't close, the baby
has a hole in the heart.

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:31.620
It is caused by prematurity
and genetic conditions.

00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:35.532
But what we know today

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.977
is that a lack of oxygen
is also one of the causes.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.244
As you can see in the chart,

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:48.363
the frequency of this kind of hole

00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:51.347
dramatically increases with altitude.

00:02:52.327 --> 00:02:55.459
Video: (Baby crying)

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:59.625
When you look at patients
with this condition,

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.906
they seem desperate to breathe.

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:07.724
To close the hole, major surgery
used to be the only solution.

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:13.518
One night, my friend Malte,
were camping in the Amazon region.

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:20.561
The only thing that would not burn
in the fire was a green avocado branch.

00:03:21.088 --> 00:03:23.815
Then came a moment of inspiration.

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:28.700
So we used the branch as a mold
for our first invention.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.104
The holes in children's hearts
can be closed with it.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.763
A coil is a piece of wire
wrapped onto itself.

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:40.736
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.077
but that was our first successful attempt

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.529
to create a device for this major problem.

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:52.808
In this video, we can see
how a very tiny catheter

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.961
takes the coil to the heart.

00:03:55.393 --> 00:03:57.697
The coil then closes the hole.

00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.526
After that moment of inspiration,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.708
there came a very long time of effort

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.471
developing a prototype.

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:14.084
In vitro and in vivo studies took
thousands of hours of work in the lab.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.910
The coil, if it works, can save lives.

00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:22.614
I returned from Germany to Bolivia,

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:25.142
thinking that wherever we go,

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:28.514
we have the opportunity
to make a difference.

00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:33.778
With my wife and partner,
Dr. Alexandra Heath,

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:35.468
we started to see patients.

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:39.793
After successfully treating
patients with our coil,

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:42.282
we felt really enthusiastic.

00:04:42.688 --> 00:04:46.530
But we live in a place

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:50.036
that is 12,000 feet high.

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:52.869
And,

00:04:54.284 --> 00:04:59.343
the patients there need a special device
to solve their heart condition.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.328
The hole in altitude
patients is different,

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:06.022
because the orifice
between the arteries is larger.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.381
Most patients cannot afford
to be treated on time,

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:12.586
and they die.

00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:17.592
The first coil could successfully treat

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:21.792
only half of the patients in Bolivia.

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:25.978
The search started again.

00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:30.820
We went back to the drawing board.

00:05:31.574 --> 00:05:33.007
After many trials,

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:38.054
and with the help of my grandmother's
indigenous friends in the mountains,

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:40.150
we obtained a new device.

00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:46.607
For centuries, indigenous women
told stories by weaving complex patterns

00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.796
on looms,

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:52.578
and an unexpected skill
helped us for the new device.

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:56.483
We take this traditional method of weaving

00:05:56.507 --> 00:06:00.477
and make a design made by a smart material

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.776
that records shape.

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.731
It seems this time,

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:10.482
the weaving allows us
to create a seamless device

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:12.279
that doesn't rust

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:16.586
because it's made of only one piece.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:21.907
It can change by itself
into very complex structures

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:25.872
by a procedure that took
decades to develop.

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.722
As you can see, the device enters the body

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:31.308
through the natural channels.

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:35.463
Doctors have only to close
the catheter through the hole.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.948
Our device expands, places itself

00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:40.447
and closes the hole.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.291
We have this beautiful delivery system

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:47.359
that is so simple to use

00:06:47.383 --> 00:06:49.533
because it works by itself.

00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:54.573
No open surgery was necessary.

00:06:55.494 --> 00:07:01.748
(Applause)

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:06.689
As doctors, we fight with diseases

00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:10.771
that take a long time
and effort to heal -- if they do.

00:07:11.443 --> 00:07:14.076
This is the child from before,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.756
after the procedure.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.399
As you can see --

00:07:17.423 --> 00:07:21.983
(Applause)

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:25.106
As you can see,
once the device is in place,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.929
the patient is 100 percent healed.

00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:30.051
From start to finish,

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:34.041
the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:39.754
That's very rewarding from the medical
and human point of view.

00:07:40.444 --> 00:07:46.987
We are so proud that some
of our former patients

00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:49.502
are part of our team --

00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:54.467
a team, thanks to added close interaction

00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:57.067
with patients that work with us.

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:01.079
Together, we have only one idea:

00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:04.419
the best solutions need to be simple.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.685
We lost the fear
of creating something new.

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:11.725
The path, it's not easy.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:15.292
Many obstacles arise all the time.

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:19.947
But we receive strength from our patients.

00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:23.447
Their resilience and courage

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:26.297
inspire our creativity.

00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:30.258
Our goal is to make sure

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:33.416
that no child is left behind,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.519
not because of cost or access.

00:08:39.367 --> 00:08:42.331
So we have to start a foundation

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.799
with a one-to-one model.

00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:48.394
We will give one device for free

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.688
to make sure that every child is treated.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.855
We are in many countries now,

00:08:56.482 --> 00:08:59.752
but we need to be everywhere.

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:03.907
This whole thing began

00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:06.795
with one impossible idea

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.714
as will continue it, really:

00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:15.118
No child is left behind.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.474
Muchas gracias.

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:22.389
(Applause)
