00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The big residual

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
is always value for money.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
All the time we are trying to get value for money.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
What we don't look for

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
is value for many,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
while we are generating value for money.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Do we care about those four billion people

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
the so-called bottom of the pyramid?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
What are the challenges in getting value for money

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
as well as value for many?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
We have described here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in terms of the performance

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and the price.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
If you have money, of course, you can get the value.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
You can get a Mercedes

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
for a very high price,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
very high performance.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
But if you don't have money, what happens?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Well, you are to ride a bicycle,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
carrying your own weight and also some other weight,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
so that you can earn the bread for the day.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Well, poor do not remain poor;

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
they become lower-middle-class.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And if they do so,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
then, of course, the conditions improve,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and they start riding on scooters.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
The issue is, at that price,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
can you give them some extra value?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
A super value,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
in terms of their ability to ride in a car,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to get that dignity, to get that safety,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
looks practically impossible, isn't it.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Now, this is something

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that we see on Indian streets

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
all the time.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But many people see the same thing

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and think things differently,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The great thing about our leaders

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is that, should they not only have passion in their belly,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
which practically all of them have,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
they're also very innovative.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
They believe that things can be done.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
But great leaders like Ratan

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
have compassion.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
it's not just Ratan Tata,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
it's the house of Tatas over time.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Let me confirm what she said.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Yes, I went barefoot

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
until I was 12.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
I struggled to [unclear] day

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
was a huge issue.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
But I was about to leave the school,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
almost a dollar per month for six years.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
That's how I'm standing before you.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So that is the House of Tata.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Applause)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Innovation, compassion and passion.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
They combine all that.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And it was that compassion which bothered them,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
how he was driving his own car --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
he drives his own car by the way --

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and he saw in the rain,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
a family like the one that I showed to you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
getting drenched with an infant.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
one lakh car, $2,000 car."

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Of course, as soon as you say something like this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
people say it is impossible,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and that's what was said by Suzuki.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
with stepney.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And you can see the cartoon here.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Ratan is taller than me,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and we have ample space in the front

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and ample space in the back in this particular car.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And incredible car.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And of course, nothing succeeds like success;

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
the cynics then turned around,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and one after the other

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
they also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
How did this great story unfold,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the making of Nano?

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Let me tell you a bit about it.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
For example, how we started:

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
young people in their mid-twenties.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And he said,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
but I will define the cost for you.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and you are to make it within that."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And he told them,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"Question the unquestionable.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Stretch the envelope."

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And at a point in time,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that he himself became a member of the team.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Can you believe it?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I still am told about this story

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
of that single wiper design in which he participated.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
But who was the team leader?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
The team leader was Girish Wagh,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And the Nano team average age

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
was just 27 years.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And they did innovation in design and beyond.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Adhesives were replacing the rivets.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
with vendors and suppliers.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
All ideas on board were welcome.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Imagine that a fellow

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
I mean, it was incredible innovation.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
It was an open innovation,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
ideas from all over were welcome.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
as well as a dashboard

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that was inspired by two-wheelers.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
The fuel lines and lamps

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
were as in two-wheelers.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And the crux of the matter was, however,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
getting more from less.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
All the time, you have been given an envelope.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
You can't cross that envelope,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And therefore, each component

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
had to have a dual functionality.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And the seat riser, for example,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
serving as a mounting for the seat

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
as well as a structural part

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
of the functional rigidity.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Half the number of parts

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
are contained in Nano

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
in comparison to a typical passenger car.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
But the current entry-level cars

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
in comparison to that is eight percent less,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
but 21 percent more inside space.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And what happened

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
was that -- more from less --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
you can see how much more for how much less.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
When the Model T was launched --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and this is, by the way, all the figures

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Model T was 19,700 by Ford.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Volkswagon was 11,333.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And British Motor was around 11,000.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
This is why

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
you started

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
actually a new paradigm shift,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
where the same people

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
who could not dream of sitting in a car,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
started dreaming of being in a car.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And those dreams are getting fulfilled.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
This is a photograph

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
of a house and a driver and a car

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
near my own home.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
The driver's name is Naran.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
He has bought his own Nano.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And you can see, there is a physical space

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that has been created for him,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
parking that car, along with the owner's car,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
but more importantly, they've created

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
a space in their mind that

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
It is not just technological,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
it is social innovation that we talk about.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
this famous theme

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
of getting more from less for more

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
becomes important.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
about one and a half years ago,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
when their academy honored me with a fellowship.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And unbelievably, in 40 years,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I was the first Indian to be honored.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And the title of my talk

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
was therefore "Indian innovation

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And I titled this more from less for more and more people

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
as Gandhian engineering.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
is the one which is going to take the world forward,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
is going to make a difference,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
not just for a few, but for everyone.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
for those unfortunates

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
who have lost their legs.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Here is an American citizen and his son

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
having an artificial foot.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
What is its price? 20,000 dollars.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And of course, these feet are so designed

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that they can walk only on

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
such perfect pavement or roads.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
You can see him walk barefoot

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and so on and so forth.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
More importantly,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
they not only walk far to work,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
and not only do they cycle to work,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but they cycle for work, as you can see here.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And they climb up for their work.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
A challenge, of course.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
you're talking about 10,000 days of income.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
You just don't have it.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
a quick molding and modular components,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
whereas the equivalent other feet

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
took something like a day, as so on.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
rather than using heated sheets.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
[unclear] and functions.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And I like to show how it looks

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and how it works.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
(Music)

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
"Did it hurt?"

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
"No ... not at all."

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:10.260
(Applause)

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
So that's what it is all about.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
And therefore Time took notice

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
of this 28-dollar foot, basically.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
(Applause)

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
An incredible story.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Let's move on to something else.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
I've been talking about getting more from less for more.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Let's move to health.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
What's happening in the area of health?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
what has happened?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
after all the human and animal testing,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
was 10 years, now it is 15 years.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
No, I'm sorry.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
So actually we are getting less from more

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
for less and less people.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
so very few will be able to basically afford that.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Let us just take an example.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Psoriasis is very dreadful

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
disease of the skin.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and 20 of them.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Time for development -- it took around 10 years

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
and 700 million dollars.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Let's start in the spirit

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
of more from less and more for more

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
and start putting some targets.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Time for development, not 10 years.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
We are in a hurry. Five years.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Looks absolutely audacious.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Looks absolutely ridiculous.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
You know something? This has been achieved in India.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
These targets have been achieved in India.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And how they have been achieved ...

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Sir Francis Bacon once said,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
"When you wish to achieve results

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
that have not been achieved before,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
it is an unwise fancy to think

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
that they can be achieved by using methods

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
that have been used before."

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And therefore, the standard process,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
are not yielding those results --

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
the billions of dollars that have been spent.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
The Indian cleverness

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
was using its traditional knowledge,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
however, scientifically validating it

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and making that journey from men to mice to men,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
not molecule to mice to men, you know.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And that is how this difference has come.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
And you can see this blending

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I launched a big program

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
obtained by this reverse form of [unclear]

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
by doing things differently.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
You can see before treatment and after treatment.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
This is really getting more from less for more and more people,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
because these are all affordable treatments now.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Let me just remind you

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
of what Mahatma Gandhi had said.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
He had said, "Earth provides enough

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
So the message he was giving us

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
was you must get more from less and less and less

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
so that you can share it for more and more people,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
not only the current generation,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
but the future generations.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
made for the benefit for all."

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
not just a few people.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
this is the theme, getting more

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
from less for more.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
And mind you,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
It's not about low cost.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
It's about ultra-low cost.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
for certain other different reasons.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
You are not talking about affordability,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
you are talking about extreme affordability.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
You're not talking exclusive innovation.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
You're talking about inclusive innovation.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
you're talking about disruptive innovation.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
The ideas have to be such

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
that you think in completely different terms.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And I would also add,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
it is not only getting more from less for more

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
by more and more people, the whole world working for it.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
You know, incubators for infants, for example.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
They're not available in Africa.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
They're not available in Indian villages.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
And infants die.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And there's a 25-dollar incubator

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
giving that performance that had been created.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
And by whom?

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
By young students from Standford University

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
That's the new world that we want to create.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
I've still one and a half to go.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
The message, the final message, is this:

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
India gave a great gift to the world.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
What was that?

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
The 21st century gift,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
which is very, very important for the whole world,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
whether it is global economic meltdown,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
whether it is climate change --

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
any problem that you talk about

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
is gaining more from less for more and more --

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
not only the current generations,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
for the future generations.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
this gift of the 21st century

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
to the world from India,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
Gandhian engineering.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:15.260
(Applause)

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
LP: A quick question for you.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Now, when you were a young boy in this school,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
What do you think that drove you?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
I remember, I went to a poor school,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
that half a dollar that was required

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
within the stipulated time.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
It was [unclear] high school.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
One day he took us out into the sun

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
and tried to show us how to find

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
the focal length of a convex lens.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
And there was a bright spot up there.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
And then he said, "This is the focal length."

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
And then the paper burned.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
if you do not diffuse your energies,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
if you focus your energies,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
you can achieve anything in the world."

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
I have to become a scientist."

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
And that message, very frankly,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
is valuable for society today.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
What does that focal length do?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
And the property of parallel lines

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
is that they never meet.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
What does that convex lens do?

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
It makes them meet.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
This is convex lens leadership.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
They divide them farther.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
So I learned the lesson

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
of convex lens leadership from that.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
I would [unclear].

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260
60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
I'm trying to build a global team,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.)

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
(Applause)
