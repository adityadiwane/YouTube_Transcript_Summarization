00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and I got a B+. (Laughter)

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And I'm gonna try and do that within

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.330
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and to follow the TED commandments:

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
that is, actually, something that creates

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
a near-death experience,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
but near-death is good for creativity.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
(Laughter) OK.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
So, I also want to explain,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.330
if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
and the one that's in between that is the censor

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
And I'm going do that also by looking at

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
what I think is part of my creative process,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
which includes a number of things that happened, actually --

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
the nothing started even earlier than the moment

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
in which I'm creating something new.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.330
And that includes nature, and nurture,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
and what I refer to as nightmares.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
we are innately equipped with something, perhaps

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
in our brains, some abnormal chromosome

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
that causes this muse-like effect.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
And others, like my mother,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.330
would say that I get my material from past lives.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
Some people would also say that creativity

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.330
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.330
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.330
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And I will mention that I actually developed

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
but it was during the time I was writing my last book,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and some people say that book is quite different.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.330
why am I not black like everybody else?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And sometimes you're equipped with skills,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
And I had a miniature poodle.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.330
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
my living out of the artful arrangement of words.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.330
and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
That figure right there, by the way,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.330
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.330
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
this was supposed to be my side occupation,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
and it led to a sense of failure.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
But actually, there was something quite real in my life

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
that happened when I was about 14.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
six months later, had brain tumors.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
and that God's will would take care of that.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.330
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
why this would have happened.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
There was a reason for everything.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.330
who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
And so, I had this notion of death all around me,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.330
because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
you begin to think very much about everything.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.330
You become very creative, in a survival sense.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
And this, then, led to my big questions.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And they're the same ones that I have today.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.330
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.330
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.330
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.330
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
in what order they happen. What are the influences?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.330
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
as the creator of that universe.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.330
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.330
-- years and years, oftentimes.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.330
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.330
to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
throughout this conference,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
almost everything that's been going on.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.330
quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
but I'm still gonna use it as the process

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
for explaining how it is the metaphor.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.330
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.330
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
But when you make those associations,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.330
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.330
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
as I understand it. (Laughter)

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And this happens constantly in the writing.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
in which you're looking for something, and

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
you know, things are happening simultaneously,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
and you're looking at it in a different way,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.330
and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
then you will only write the about.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
You won't discover anything.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
And what you were supposed to find,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
is no longer there.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
Now, I don't want to ignore

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
the other side of what happens in our universe,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
like many of our scientists have.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
and just say that creative people are multidimensional,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
There is also a big question of ambiguity.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:56.330
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
It is constantly there. And, just as an example,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
this is one that recently came to me.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.330
who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.330
So, there was another one that I came across,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
and it's "saving fish from drowning."

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
because they're not supposed to kill anything.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.330
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.330
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.330
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
or you're going to get stuck.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.330
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.330
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.330
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
And then we have intentions.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.330
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
and then we do something.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
What are we supposed to do?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Do we stay in for life,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.330
or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:04.330
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
That is the ambiguity in my life

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
"Saving Fish From Drowning."

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:19.330
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
I got these hints everywhere.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:34.330
and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.330
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
And when I have the question, it is a focus.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.330
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.330
that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
And it seems like it's happening all the time.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
in which you're getting all this help from the universe.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.330
And you are noticing it more often.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
But you apply this.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
Why or why not?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
It may be something that is perhaps more serious

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
-- as I said, human rights in Burma.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
that I approved of the military regime there.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
that other people have given us?"

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.330
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
who was a Baptist minister.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
and still didn't know that if I went there,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.330
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.330
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:24.330
so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
and we talked about today, is genocide.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
This leads to this question.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.330
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
and I consider what my intentions should be,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.330
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
and what is my place in the universe?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.330
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.330
and yet it is also absolutely necessary.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.330
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.330
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
and that actually was the way it happened.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.330
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
There are also things, quite uncanny,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.330
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
In this case, I was writing a story

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.330
that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
And I took down this book, and I --

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:58.330
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.330
happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
and a character who thought he was the son of God.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
You wonder, are these things random chance?

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.330
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.330
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
And that goes into the story, too.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
Especially when good things happen,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.330
and, in particular, when bad things happen.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
and I do want to know what those elements are,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.330
so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.330
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.330
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.330
-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.330
and we ended up in this non-tourist location,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
a beautiful village, pristine.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
And we walked three valleys beyond,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:09.330
a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:19.330
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.330
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.330
that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.330
walking along the beach, I came across this.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
And it was a man, a Chinese man,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.330
and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.330
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.330
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.330
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
and I cannot explain it.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.330
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
in writing about these things?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:12.330
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.330
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.330
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.330
What is the nature of accidents?

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:24.330
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.330
outside of a court of law?

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
I was able to see that in a firsthand way,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:36.330
when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
if I wanted to write anything about China.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.330
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.330
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.330
there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.330
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:06.330
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
Responsibility was assigned to the family.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.330
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.330
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.330
It's the son, not the father."

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:24.330
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.330
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.330
And I began to sense something different about the history,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.330
and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.330
and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:52.330
with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:57.330
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:05.330
a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.330
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.330
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.330
would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
and seeing the amazing things that happened,

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.330
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.330
determining how things happen.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.330
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.330
the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.330
-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.330
and that is where I'm gonna find the answers

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.330
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.330
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.330
as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:55.330
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.330
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:05.330
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.330
And how do I create my own life?

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.330
And I think it is by questioning,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.330
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.330
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.330
and the past, the specifics of that past,

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:26.330
and what is happening in the story at that point.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.330
I also believe that in thinking about things --

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.330
my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.330
God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:43.330
I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.330
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:52.330
and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?

00:20:52.330 --> 00:21:00.330
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.330
and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:11.330
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.330
And they have to be in all possibilities,

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.330
including those I never considered before.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.330
So, there are never complete answers.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.330
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.330
myself that there is uncertainty in everything,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.330
and that is good, because then I will discover something new.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.330
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.330
it is to simply imagine.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.330
And to imagine is to put myself in that story,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:50.330
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:56.330
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:02.330
-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.330
to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.330
Because for everything,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.330
in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:18.330
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.330
We've come to the end of the talk,

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.330
and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.330
and it is the things that transform in our lives,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:37.330
that are wonderful and stay with us.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.330
There she is.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.330
Thank you very much!

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:46.330
(Applause)
