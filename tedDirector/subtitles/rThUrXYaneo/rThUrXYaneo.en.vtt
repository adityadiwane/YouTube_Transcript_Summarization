00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.503
So, imagine that you take
a 19-hour, very long drive

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.162
to Disney World,

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:22.690
with two kids in the back seat.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:29.208
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.065
the immutable laws of nature dictate

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.145
that you get the question:

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.533
"Are we there yet?"

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:37.814
(Laughter)

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.826
So you answer this question
a hundred more times, easily,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.009
in the negative,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.433
but you finally arrive.

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.230
You have a wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful trip.

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:52.031
You drive 19 long hours back home.

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:54.895
And when you get there,

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.536
the police are waiting on you.

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.429
They accuse you of committing a crime

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:02.720
that occurred while you
were away in Florida.

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:06.566
You tell anybody and everybody
who will listen,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.053
"I didn't do it!

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:09.428
I couldn't have done it!

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:13.290
I was hanging out with Mickey
and Minnie and my kids!"

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:15.823
But no one believes you.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:18.945
Ultimately, you're arrested,

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:20.867
you're tried,

00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:22.191
you're convicted

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.508
and you are sentenced.

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.102
And you spend 25 years in jail,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.432
until someone comes along and proves --

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:34.808
has the evidence to prove --

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:38.476
that you actually were in Florida

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.269
when this crime was committed.

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:42.786
So.

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:45.305
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.470
and the last several years,
I have worked on

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:52.644
winning the release of innocent people

00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:55.386
who've been wrongfully convicted --

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:57.793
people like Jonathan Fleming,

00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:01.871
who spent 24 years, eight months in jail

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:05.493
for a murder that was committed
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:09.000
while he was in Disney World

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.297
with his kids.

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:12.116
How do we know this?

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:14.353
Because when he was arrested,

00:02:15.108 --> 00:02:17.899
among his property in his back pocket

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:19.927
was a receipt --

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:22.682
time-stamped receipt

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:25.567
that showed that he was in Disney World.

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:29.267
That receipt was put in the police file,

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.917
a copy of it was put
in the prosecutor's file,

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.173
and they never gave it
to his public defender.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.139
In fact, nobody even knew it was there.

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:39.902
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:44.297
My team looked through the file,
and we found it,

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:46.949
did the rest of the investigation,

00:02:46.973 --> 00:02:49.260
and figured out someone else
committed the crime.

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:52.424
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:54.387
and he is now released.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:56.923
Let me give you a little bit of context.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:01.760
So about three years ago, I got a call
from the Brooklyn District Attorney.

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:05.867
He asked whether I'd be interested
in designing a program

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.869
called a "conviction review unit."

00:03:07.893 --> 00:03:09.174
So I said yes.

00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:13.865
A conviction review unit is essentially
a unit in a prosecutor's office

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.006
where prosecutors look at their past cases

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.641
to determine whether or not
they made mistakes.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:22.317
Over the course of the first year,

00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:25.435
we found about 13 wrongful convictions,

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.994
people having been in jail for decades,

00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:29.653
and we released all of them.

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:32.355
It was the most in New York history.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.871
The program is still going on,

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:37.162
and they're up to 21 releases now --

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:41.542
21 people who spent
significant time behind bars.

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:47.531
So let me tell you about a couple other
of the men and women

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:50.839
that I interacted with
in the course of this program.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.238
One name is Roger Logan.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.122
Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:58.626
and wrote me a letter.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.793
It was a simple letter; it basically said,

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:03.871
"Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent.
I've been framed.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.250
Can you look at my case?"

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.243
At first blush, the case seemed
like it was open and shut,

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.300
but my research had shown

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:14.935
that single-witness identification cases

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.237
are prone to error.

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:18.996
It doesn't mean he was innocent,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.337
it just means we ought to look
a little bit closer at those cases.

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.671
So we did.

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:25.696
And the facts were relatively simple.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.802
The eyewitness said she heard a shot,

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:31.877
and she ran to the next building
and turned around and looked,

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.482
and there was Mr. Logan.

00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:38.536
And he was tried and convicted
and in jail for 17-some-odd years.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.374
But it was a single-witness case,
so we took a look at it.

00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:44.518
I sent some people to the scene,
and there was an inconsistency.

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:49.679
And to put it politely:

00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:53.362
Usain Bolt couldn't have run
from where she said she was

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:54.574
to the other spot.

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:55.750
Right?

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:58.191
So we knew that wasn't true.

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:00.842
So it still didn't mean
that he didn't do it,

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:04.850
but we knew something was maybe fishy
about this witness.

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.488
So we looked through the file,

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:09.851
a piece of paper in the file
had a number on it.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.841
The number indicated
that this witness had a record.

00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:16.673
We went back through 20 years
of non-digitized papers

00:05:16.697 --> 00:05:19.273
to figure out what this record was about,

00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:21.784
and it turned out -- it turned out --

00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:25.316
the eyewitness was in jail

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.259
when she said she saw what she saw.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.751
The man spent 17 years behind bars.

00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:38.063
The last one is a case about two boys,

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.908
Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:42.407
They were arrested at 15,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.340
and their conviction was vacated
29 years later.

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.479
Now this was a case,

00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:53.307
once again -- first blush,
it looked open and shut.

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.603
They had confessed.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.321
But my research showed
that juvenile confessions

00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.834
without a parent present

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.293
are prone to error.

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.583
The DNA cases proved this several times.

00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:04.981
So we took a close look.

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:07.377
We looked at the confession,

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:08.565
and it turned out,

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.451
there was something in the confession

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.443
that those boys could not have known.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:15.198
The only people who knew it
were police and prosecutors.

00:06:15.222 --> 00:06:17.493
We knew what really happened;

00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:19.076
someone told them to say this.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.969
We don't exactly know who,

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:22.460
which person did,

00:06:22.484 --> 00:06:25.379
but any rate, the confession was coerced,

00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:26.757
we determined.

00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:29.074
We then went back and did forensics

00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:30.784
and did a fulsome investigation

00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:32.204
and found that two other,

00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:35.087
much older, different heights,
different hairstyle,

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:37.445
two other people committed the crime,

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.739
not these two boys.

00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:41.206
I actually went to court that day,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.772
for what's called a "vacatur hearing,"

00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:46.907
where the conviction is thrown out.

00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:48.633
I went to court; I wanted to see

00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.788
Mr. McCallum walk out of there.

00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:52.966
So I went to court,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.759
and the judge said something
that judges say all the time,

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:57.992
but this took on a really special meaning.

00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:01.133
He looked up after the arguments and said,

00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:02.360
"Mr. McCallum,"

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:04.817
he said five beautiful words:

00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:08.865
"You are free to go."

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:11.973
Can you imagine?

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.375
After just about 30 years:

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.664
"You are free to go."

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:20.324
And he walked out of that courtroom.

00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:24.594
Unfortunately,
his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:26.748
didn't get the benefit of that.

00:07:27.297 --> 00:07:29.155
You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.088
at 34 years old,

00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:35.504
and his mother sat
at counsel table in his place.

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:39.276
I'll never forget this
the rest of my life.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.277
She just rocked at the table, saying,

00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:44.261
"I knew my baby didn't do this.

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:46.504
I knew my baby didn't do this."

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:47.911
And her baby didn't do this.

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:49.871
Two other guys did it.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:54.223
If there's anything that we've learned,
anything that I've learned,

00:07:54.247 --> 00:07:57.435
with this conviction integrity work,

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:00.398
it's that justice doesn't happen.

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:05.428
People make justice happen.

00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:12.156
Justice is not a thing
that just descends from above

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.560
and makes everything right.

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:18.405
If it did, Mr. Stuckey
wouldn't have died in prison.

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:21.299
Justice is something

00:08:21.323 --> 00:08:24.421
that people of goodwill make happen.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:29.300
Justice is a decision.

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:33.940
Justice is a decision.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.621
We make justice happen.

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:40.045
You know, the scary thing is,

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:42.686
in each of these three cases I described,

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.312
it would have only taken
just an extra minute --

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:46.951
an extra minute --

00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:49.118
for someone to look through the file

00:08:49.142 --> 00:08:50.630
and find this receipt.

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:54.680
Just one -- to look through the file,
find the receipt,

00:08:55.504 --> 00:08:57.371
give it to the public defender.

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:01.244
It would have taken someone just a minute

00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:05.915
to look at the video confession
and say, "That cannot be."

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:08.285
Just a minute.

00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:12.504
And perhaps Mr. Stuckey
would be alive today.

00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:16.652
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.

00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:20.959
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays
would always recite,

00:09:20.983 --> 00:09:22.696
and he called it "God's Minute."

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.293
And it goes something like this:

00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:26.434
"I have only just a minute,

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:28.485
only 60 seconds in it,

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.784
forced upon me, can't refuse it,

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.074
didn't seek it, didn't choose it.

00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.652
But it's up to me to use it.

00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:38.114
I must suffer if I lose it,
give account if I abuse it.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.249
Just a tiny little minute,

00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.405
but eternity is in it."

00:09:45.723 --> 00:09:47.273
If I were to charge

00:09:47.297 --> 00:09:48.930
each and every one of us,

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:52.163
I would want to say something like,

00:09:53.782 --> 00:09:54.934
"Every day,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:56.839
every day,

00:09:57.755 --> 00:09:59.819
take just one extra minute

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.996
and do some justice.

00:10:04.752 --> 00:10:06.154
You don't have to --

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:10.191
I mean, some people spend
their careers and their lives,

00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:11.453
like public defenders,

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:12.717
doing justice every day.

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.346
But in your professional lives,
whatever you do,

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.060
take time out

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.248
to just

00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:21.683
do some justice.

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:23.421
Make a colleague feel better.

00:10:23.903 --> 00:10:26.454
If you hear something that's sexist,

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:29.365
don't laugh, speak up.

00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:32.537
If someone is down, lift them up,

00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:35.255
one extra minute each day,

00:10:36.073 --> 00:10:38.395
and it'll be a great, great place.

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.215
I want to show you something.

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:44.752
Now, above me is a picture

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:46.197
of David McCallum.

00:10:47.173 --> 00:10:50.053
This is the day
he was released from prison.

00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:53.134
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:55.950
he had never been able to touch before.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.555
And I asked him then,

00:10:59.383 --> 00:11:02.082
I said, "What's the first thing
you want to do?"

00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:04.485
And he said, "I just want
to walk on the sidewalk

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:06.690
without anybody telling me where to go."

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.995
Wasn't bitter,

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:10.925
just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.

00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.662
I spoke to Mr. McCallum
about two weeks ago.

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:16.363
I went to New York.

00:11:16.387 --> 00:11:19.150
It was on the two-year anniversary

00:11:19.174 --> 00:11:20.744
of his release.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.740
And we talked,

00:11:22.764 --> 00:11:25.228
we laughed, we hugged, we cried.

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:28.060
And he's doing quite well.

00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:31.970
And one of the things he said
when we met with him

00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:35.124
is that he now has dedicated his life

00:11:35.148 --> 00:11:36.517
and his career

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.700
to ensuring that nobody else
is locked up unjustly.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:43.773
Justice, my friends,

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:46.665
is a decision.

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:48.553
Thank you very much.

00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:52.717
(Applause)
