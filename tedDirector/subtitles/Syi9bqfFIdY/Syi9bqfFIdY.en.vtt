00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.678
All right. So, like all good stories,

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:19.612
this starts a long, long time ago

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:21.761
when there was basically nothing.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.161
So here is a complete picture of the universe

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.613
about 14-odd billion years ago.

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:30.697
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.281
For some reason it explodes,

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.397
and you begin to get these things.

00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:37.263
So you're now about 14 billion years into this.

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:39.159
And these things expand and expand and expand

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.858
into these giant galaxies,

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:42.177
and you get trillions of them.

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:44.325
And within these galaxies

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.444
you get these enormous dust clouds.

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.209
And I want you to pay particular attention

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.659
to the three little prongs

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.560
in the center of this picture.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.975
If you take a close-up of those,

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:54.628
they look like this.

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:57.478
And what you're looking at is columns of dust

00:00:57.478 --> 00:00:59.525
where there's so much dust --

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.858
by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles --

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:06.776
and what's happening is there's so much dust,

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.710
it comes together and it fuses

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.169
and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:13.011
And so what you're watching

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:14.996
is the birth of stars.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:16.653
These are stars being born out of here.

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:19.121
When enough stars come out,

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.919
they create a galaxy.

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:24.353
This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:26.569
because you are here.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.736
(Laughter)

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:29.387
And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,

00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:31.452
you find a relatively normal,

00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:33.820
not particularly interesting star.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.835
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:40.017
So this star doesn't even appear

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.968
until about two-thirds of the way into this story.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:44.046
And then what happens

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:45.452
is there's enough dust left over

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:47.418
that it doesn't ignite into a star,

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.418
it becomes a planet.

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:54.243
And this is about a little over four billion years ago.

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:55.676
And soon thereafter

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.593
there's enough material left over

00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:02.156
that you get a primordial soup,

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.920
and that creates life.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.801
And life starts to expand and expand and expand,

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.552
until it goes kaput.

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:13.040
(Laughter)

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.470
Now the really strange thing

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.376
is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:19.592
but five times.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.694
So almost all life on Earth

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:24.158
is wiped out about five times.

00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:25.710
And as you're thinking about that,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.142
what happens is you get more and more complexity,

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:29.376
more and more stuff

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:33.494
to build new things with.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:34.764
And we don't appear

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:40.412
until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,

00:02:40.412 --> 00:02:44.342
just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:47.801
So within that context, there's two theories of the case

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.490
as to why we're all here.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.079
The first theory of the case

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.488
is that's all she wrote.

00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:55.847
Under that theory,

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:57.683
we are the be-all and end-all

00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:59.416
of all creation.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.300
And the reason for trillions of galaxies,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.313
sextillions of planets,

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:09.023
is to create something that looks like that

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:12.656
and something that looks like that.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:14.197
And that's the purpose of the universe;

00:03:14.197 --> 00:03:15.481
and then it flat-lines,

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:16.792
it doesn't get any better.

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:21.272
(Laughter)

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.091
The only question you might want to ask yourself is,

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:29.326
could that be just mildly arrogant?

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:31.067
And if it is --

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:36.449
and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.816
There were only about 2,000 of our species left.

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:41.899
A few more weeks without rain,

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.983
we would have never seen any of these.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:51.682
(Laughter)

00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:56.316
(Applause)

00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:59.282
So maybe you have to think about a second theory

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:02.199
if the first one isn't good enough.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.983
Second theory is: Could we upgrade?

00:04:03.983 --> 00:04:06.882
(Laughter)

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:10.116
Well, why would one ask a question like that?

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.581
Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far

00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.617
of humanoids.

00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:17.467
So it turns out that we have upgraded.

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:19.382
We've upgraded time and again and again.

00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:22.298
And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.

00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:24.482
We found this one last year.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:27.099
We found another one last month.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.298
And as you're thinking about this,

00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:31.401
you might also ask the question:

00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:34.498
So why a single human species?

00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:36.332
Wouldn't it be really odd

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:40.116
if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:42.735
and found exactly the same bird --

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:46.527
particularly given that we co-existed at the same time

00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:49.313
with at least eight other versions of humanoid

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:51.781
at the same time on this planet?

00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.660
So the normal state of affairs

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.170
is not to have just a Homo sapiens;

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.191
the normal state of affairs

00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.020
is to have various versions of humans walking around.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.837
And if that is the normal state of affairs,

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:06.205
then you might ask yourself,

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.270
all right, so if we want to create something else,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.138
how big does a mutation have to be?

00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:13.770
Well Svante Paabo has the answer.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.570
The difference between humans and Neanderthal

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.869
is 0.004 percent of gene code.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.569
That's how big the difference is

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.786
one species to another.

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:28.186
This explains most contemporary political debates.

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:30.121
(Laughter)

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.332
But as you're thinking about this,

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:34.690
one of the interesting things

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.087
is how small these mutations are and where they take place.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.420
Difference human/Neanderthal

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.153
is sperm and testis,

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.521
smell and skin.

00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:44.007
And those are the specific genes

00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:46.687
that differ from one to the other.

00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:49.788
So very small changes can have a big impact.

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:51.420
And as you're thinking about this,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.936
we're continuing to mutate.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:56.837
So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,

00:05:56.837 --> 00:05:58.897
we had one mutation in one gene

00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:01.453
which led to blue eyes.

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:05.337
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing.

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:06.771
And as it continues,

00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.536
one of the things that's going to happen this year

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:11.869
is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.138
because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.

00:06:15.138 --> 00:06:16.726
And when we find these,

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.220
we may find differences.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.296
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,

00:06:22.296 --> 00:06:25.672
because we have really misused the science in this.

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:29.355
In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:33.153
That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.

00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:35.289
He was Darwin's cousin.

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.604
But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,

00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:40.186
Stanford, American Neurological Association

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:42.054
took this really far.

00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:45.653
That got exported and was really misused.

00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:48.338
In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:50.351
treatment of human beings.

00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:52.945
So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.265
we're all identical.

00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:57.542
We're going to know at year end if that is true.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.274
And as we think about that,

00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:00.792
we're actually beginning to find things

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:04.258
like, do you have an ACE gene?

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:06.236
Why would that matter?

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:10.274
Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:13.024
that doesn't have an ACE gene.

00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:14.893
And if you want to get more specific,

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.908
how about a 577R genotype?

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:22.608
Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.858
carries at least one of these variants.

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:27.512
If that is true,

00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:29.670
it leads to some very complicated questions

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.471
for the London Olympics.

00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:32.990
Three options:

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.822
Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:38.522
for really hardworking mutants?

00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.255
(Laughter)

00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:42.990
Option number two:

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.388
Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?

00:07:46.388 --> 00:07:48.862
Because you have one and you don't have one,

00:07:48.862 --> 00:07:52.857
I'll give you a tenth of a second head start.

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:53.928
Version number three:

00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:55.997
Because this is a naturally occurring gene

00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:58.779
and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.728
you get the right to upgrade.

00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:04.479
Three different options.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.101
If these differences are the difference

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:09.479
between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.313
And it turns out that as we discover these things,

00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:15.648
we human beings really like to change

00:08:15.648 --> 00:08:17.342
how we look, how we act,

00:08:17.342 --> 00:08:18.936
what our bodies do.

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:23.310
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.627
except that with the technologies that are coming online today,

00:08:26.627 --> 00:08:29.328
today's corrections, deletions,

00:08:29.328 --> 00:08:31.247
augmentations and enhancements

00:08:31.247 --> 00:08:34.160
are going to seem like child's play.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.861
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,

00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:41.428
but this ability to start filling

00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:44.361
things like inkjet cartridges with cells

00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:49.035
are allowing us to print skin, organs

00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:51.785
and a whole series of other body parts.

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:53.669
And as these technologies go forward,

00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:57.453
you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --

00:08:57.453 --> 00:09:00.227
2000, human genome sequence --

00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:04.009
and it seems like nothing's happening,

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:07.121
until it does.

00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:10.645
And we may just be in some of these weeks.

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:12.244
And as you're thinking about

00:09:12.244 --> 00:09:15.695
these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:19.248
and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,

00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:22.412
then you don't hear a lot,

00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:26.396
until you hear about an experiment last year in China,

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:30.413
where they take skin cells from this mouse,

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:32.146
put four chemicals on it,

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:35.712
turn those skin cells into stem cells,

00:09:35.712 --> 00:09:37.177
let the stem cells grow

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:40.264
and create a full copy of that mouse.

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:43.511
That's a big deal.

00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:44.527
Because in essence

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:46.675
what it means is you can take a cell,

00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:48.961
which is a pluripotent stem cell,

00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:51.645
which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,

00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:55.462
and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.244
four, eight, 16,

00:09:57.244 --> 00:09:58.912
and then it gets so crowded

00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:00.712
after 16 divisions

00:10:00.712 --> 00:10:03.214
that those cells have to differentiate.

00:10:03.214 --> 00:10:04.647
So they go down one side of the mountain,

00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:05.880
they go down another.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.414
And as they pick that,

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:09.664
these become bone,

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:12.596
and then they pick another road and these become platelets,

00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:14.713
and these become macrophages,

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:15.980
and these become T cells.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.932
But it's really hard, once you ski down,

00:10:17.932 --> 00:10:19.455
to get back up.

00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:24.867
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:27.316
And what those four chemicals do

00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:29.385
is they take any cell

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.317
and take it way back up the mountain

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:33.350
so it can become any body part.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.078
And as you think of that,

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:37.058
what it means is potentially

00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:39.233
you can rebuild a full copy

00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:41.100
of any organism

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.686
out of any one of its cells.

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:46.217
That turns out to be a big deal

00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:48.783
because now you can take, not just mouse cells,

00:10:48.783 --> 00:10:51.101
but you can human skin cells

00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.751
and turn them into human stem cells.

00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.949
And then what they did in October

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.349
is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells

00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:05.022
and began to turn them into liver cells.

00:11:05.022 --> 00:11:06.066
So in theory,

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:11.250
you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.968
Here's a second experiment:

00:11:12.968 --> 00:11:16.101
If you could photocopy your body,

00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:19.153
maybe you also want to take your mind.

00:11:19.153 --> 00:11:20.718
And one of the things you saw at TED

00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:21.968
about a year and a half ago

00:11:21.968 --> 00:11:23.403
was this guy.

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:26.003
And he gave a wonderful technical talk.

00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:27.602
He's a professor at MIT.

00:11:27.602 --> 00:11:29.518
But in essence what he said

00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:31.218
is you can take retroviruses,

00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:34.018
which get inside brain cells of mice.

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:36.458
You can tag them with proteins

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.552
that light up when you light them.

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:42.268
And you can map the exact pathways

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:45.751
when a mouse sees, feels, touches,

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:47.934
remembers, loves.

00:11:47.934 --> 00:11:50.307
And then you can take a fiber optic cable

00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:54.126
and light up some of the same things.

00:11:54.126 --> 00:11:55.958
And by the way, as you do this,

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.975
you can image it in two colors,

00:11:57.975 --> 00:12:00.374
which means you can download this information

00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:05.114
as binary code directly into a computer.

00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:07.587
So what's the bottom line on that?

00:12:07.587 --> 00:12:09.787
Well it's not completely inconceivable

00:12:09.787 --> 00:12:14.282
that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,

00:12:14.282 --> 00:12:16.669
maybe into a new body.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:21.754
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.

00:12:21.754 --> 00:12:24.268
And this might have just one or two

00:12:24.268 --> 00:12:27.788
small ethical, political, moral implications.

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.319
(Laughter)

00:12:29.319 --> 00:12:32.310
Just a thought.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.838
Here's the kind of questions

00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:35.818
that are becoming interesting questions

00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:38.302
for philosophers, for governing people,

00:12:38.302 --> 00:12:41.668
for economists, for scientists.

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:44.952
Because these technologies are moving really quickly.

00:12:44.952 --> 00:12:46.452
And as you think about it,

00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:49.534
let me close with an example of the brain.

00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:51.217
The first place where you would expect

00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:54.268
to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,

00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:56.533
both because of the inputs,

00:12:56.533 --> 00:12:58.085
which are becoming massive,

00:12:58.085 --> 00:12:59.867
and because of the plasticity of the organ,

00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:02.401
is the brain.

00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:05.719
Do we have any evidence that that is happening?

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:10.450
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.952
Here's what it looks like in 2000.

00:13:12.952 --> 00:13:15.034
Here's what it looks like in 2002,

00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:19.652
2006, 2008.

00:13:19.652 --> 00:13:23.734
Here's the increase in less than a decade.

00:13:23.734 --> 00:13:28.151
And we still don't know why this is happening.

00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:30.636
What we do know is, potentially,

00:13:30.636 --> 00:13:32.668
the brain is reacting in

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.802
a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,

00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:37.752
and creating individuals that are like this.

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:40.509
And this is only one of the conditions that's out there.

00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:44.049
You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,

00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:46.446
people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,

00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:47.831
people who've got synesthesia,

00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:49.162
people who've got schizophrenia.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.696
You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.914
and we still don't understand

00:13:52.914 --> 00:13:55.147
how and why this is happening.

00:13:55.147 --> 00:13:57.829
But one question you might want to ask is,

00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:00.457
are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain

00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.282
and of how we process data?

00:14:02.282 --> 00:14:05.345
Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.829
we're trying to take in as much data in a day

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:11.380
as people used to take in in a lifetime.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.012
And as you're thinking about this,

00:14:14.012 --> 00:14:16.354
there's four theories as to why this might be going on,

00:14:16.354 --> 00:14:17.681
plus a whole series of others.

00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:19.330
I don't have a good answer.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.946
There really needs to be more research on this.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.181
One option is the fast food fetish.

00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:27.630
There's beginning to be some evidence

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.881
that obesity and diet

00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:31.512
have something to do

00:14:31.512 --> 00:14:33.280
with gene modifications,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.630
which may or may not have an impact

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.147
on how the brain of an infant works.

00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:43.102
A second option is the sexy geek option.

00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:47.345
These conditions are highly rare.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.383
(Laughter)

00:14:50.383 --> 00:14:55.683
(Applause)

00:14:55.683 --> 00:14:57.316
But what's beginning to happen

00:14:57.316 --> 00:14:59.850
is because these geeks are all getting together,

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.747
because they are highly qualified for computer programming

00:15:02.747 --> 00:15:05.065
and it is highly remunerated,

00:15:05.065 --> 00:15:08.215
as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:10.664
that they are concentrating geographically

00:15:10.664 --> 00:15:13.631
and finding like-minded mates.

00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:17.199
So this is the assortative mating hypothesis

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.899
of these genes reinforcing one another

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:22.016
in these structures.

00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:24.966
The third, is this too much information?

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.463
We're trying to process so much stuff

00:15:26.463 --> 00:15:28.815
that some people get synesthetic

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:31.415
and just have huge pipes that remember everything.

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:34.084
Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.

00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:38.066
Other people react with various psychological conditions

00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:39.698
or reactions to this information.

00:15:39.698 --> 00:15:42.400
Or maybe it's chemicals.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.165
But when you see an increase

00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:46.516
of that order of magnitude in a condition,

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:48.081
either you're not measuring it right

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.599
or there's something going on very quickly,

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:54.631
and it may be evolution in real time.

00:15:54.631 --> 00:15:57.134
Here's the bottom line.

00:15:57.134 --> 00:15:59.315
What I think we are doing

00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:01.031
is we're transitioning as a species.

00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:06.515
And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.

00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:08.966
I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis

00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:10.365
that, for better or worse,

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:14.547
is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,

00:16:14.547 --> 00:16:17.766
it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately

00:16:17.766 --> 00:16:20.964
control the evolution of its own species,

00:16:20.964 --> 00:16:24.798
of bacteria, of plants, of animals.

00:16:24.798 --> 00:16:27.633
And I think that's such an order of magnitude change

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:30.736
that your grandkids or your great-grandkids

00:16:30.736 --> 00:16:33.781
may be a species very different from you.

00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:35.367
Thank you very much.

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:40.698
(Applause)
