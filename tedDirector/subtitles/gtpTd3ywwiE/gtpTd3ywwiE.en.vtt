00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.952
I made a film that was impossible to make,

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:19.603
but I didn't know it was impossible,

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:22.395
and that's how I was able to do it.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.855
"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:29.053
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.

00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:31.255
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:34.937
because it's expensive, it's set in the future,

00:00:34.937 --> 00:00:36.597
and it's got tons of visual effects,

00:00:36.597 --> 00:00:39.028
and it's shot on green screen.

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:41.179
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.164
ever since I was a kid, really,

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:45.273
back when I was reading some comic books

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:48.869
and dreaming about what the future might be.

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:51.505
When American producers see my film,

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:54.789
they think that I had a big budget to do it,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.908
like 23 million.

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:00.894
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.443
I did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.

00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:04.539
So you might wonder, what's the deal here?

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.092
How did I do this?

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:10.329
Well, it's two things. First, it's time.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.110
When you don't have money, you must take time,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.002
and it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.332
The second aspect is love.

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:23.870
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.040
And it seems like every department had nothing,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.068
so they had to rely on our creativity

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.642
and turn every problem into an opportunity.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:33.668
And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:37.808
how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:41.216
But let me go back in time a bit.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:44.373
In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:46.407
but they weren't your usual graphic novels.

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:48.900
They were books telling a science fiction story

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.605
through images and text,

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.188
and most of the actors who are now starring

00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:57.246
in the movie adaptation, they were already involved

00:01:57.246 --> 00:02:00.840
in these books portraying characters

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.387
into a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:10.090
And one of these actors is the great stage director

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.534
and actor Robert Lepage.

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.055
And I just love this guy.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:16.500
I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.303
His career I admire a lot.

00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:22.236
And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:26.396
and he was kind enough to lend his image

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.059
to the character of Eugène Spaak,

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.681
who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation

00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:38.151
in between time, space, love, music and women.

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:41.706
And he was a perfect fit for the part,

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:44.890
and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.226
He was the one who believed in me

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.803
and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.758
into a film, and to write, direct,

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:55.810
and produce the film myself.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.620
And Robert is actually the very first example

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.504
of how constraints can boost creativity.

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:06.171
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:09.294
I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.134
and he's really hard to get,

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:16.017
and I wanted him to be in the movie,

00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:17.922
to reprise his role in the movie.

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.918
But the thing is, had I waited

00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:23.470
for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.266
a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.950
But that's kind of a big problem.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.243
How do you get somebody who is too busy

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:34.369
to star in a movie?

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.271
Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.016
and this is a true story, by the way —

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:42.928
I said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:45.091
Because, you know, he is everywhere

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.957
and nowhere on the planet at the same time,

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.528
and he's an illuminated being in my mind,

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:53.782
and he's in between reality and virtual reality,

00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:55.756
so it would make perfect sense

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:58.006
to turn this guy into a hologram."

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:00.326
Everybody around the table laughed,

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.862
but the joke was kind of a good solution,

00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:05.318
so that's what we ended up doing.

00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:09.021
Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.

00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:11.463
He was dressed in green and he was like

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:13.207
in a green aquarium.

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:15.985
Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:18.598
so that in post-production we could use

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.490
pretty much any angle we needed,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.902
and we shot only his head.

00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:25.408
Six months later there was a guy on set,

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.238
a mime portraying the body,

00:04:27.238 --> 00:04:29.678
the vehicle for the head.

00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:32.929
And he was wearing a green hood

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:36.111
so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:38.398
and replace it with Robert Lepage's head.

00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:40.406
So he became like a renaissance man,

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:42.456
and here's what it looks like in the movie.

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:54.776
(Music)

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.944
(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing

00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:59.138
didn't account for the technical challenges.

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:03.081
I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.

00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:07.364
I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:11.296
but I might have hit a heartstring.

00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:13.678
It still sounds too low.]

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:14.609
Jacques Languirand: [That's normal.

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:17.771
The instrument always ends up resembling its model.]

00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:23.301
(Music)

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:41.684
Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments

00:05:41.684 --> 00:05:43.828
that you see in this excerpt,

00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:46.335
they're my second example of how

00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:48.727
constraints can boost creativity,

00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:51.947
because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.

00:05:51.947 --> 00:05:53.648
They are objects of desire.

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:56.043
They are imaginary musical instruments.

00:05:56.043 --> 00:05:58.123
And they carry a nice story with them.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:02.777
Actually, I knew what these things would look like

00:06:02.777 --> 00:06:04.607
in my mind for many, many years.

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:08.820
But my problem was, I didn't have the money

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.601
to pay for them. I couldn't afford them.

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.032
So that's kind of a big problem too.

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:17.633
How do you get something that you can't afford?

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:21.593
And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.

00:06:21.593 --> 00:06:25.756
I said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:28.617
(Laughter)

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:32.345
But who on Earth would be interested

00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:35.561
by seven not-yet-built musical instruments

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.261
inspired by women's bodies?

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:40.175
And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:43.533
because who better to understand the kind of

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:46.212
crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.386
So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,

00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:52.154
and I presented my crazy idea to him

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:55.388
with sketches like this and visual references,

00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:58.115
and something pretty amazing happened.

00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:00.466
Guy was interested by this idea

00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:03.771
not because I was asking for his money,

00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.197
but because I came to him with a good idea

00:07:07.197 --> 00:07:08.919
in which everybody was happy.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.028
It was kind of a perfect triangle

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:14.515
in which the art buyer was happy

00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:17.455
because he got the instruments at a cheaper price,

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:19.328
because they weren't even made.

00:07:19.328 --> 00:07:20.937
He took a leap of faith.

00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:24.794
And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:27.623
he was happy too because he had a dream project

00:07:27.623 --> 00:07:29.104
to work on for a year.

00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:32.918
And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:37.726
in my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:39.444
So here they are.

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:42.918
And my last example of how constraints

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:44.427
can boost creativity

00:07:44.427 --> 00:07:48.037
comes from the green,

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:51.880
because this is a weird color, a crazy color,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.942
and you need to replace the green screens eventually

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:57.763
and you must figure that out sooner rather than later.

00:07:57.763 --> 00:08:01.936
And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:03.952
as to what the world would be,

00:08:03.952 --> 00:08:09.030
but then again I turned to my childhood imagination

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.593
and went to the work of Belgian comic book master

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:15.241
François Schuiten in Belgium.

00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:18.561
And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:21.033
and I wanted him to be involved in the movie

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:23.281
as a production designer.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:25.618
But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,

00:08:25.618 --> 00:08:28.305
the guy is too busy and he will say no.

00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:32.159
Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.158
I might as well call the real guy and ask him,

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:36.834
and I sent him my books,

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:38.857
and he answered that he was interested

00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:40.678
in working on the film with me

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:44.862
because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:48.756
In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:51.590
So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.535
drawing every single frame that's in the film

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:57.749
to turn that into Montreal in the future.

00:08:57.749 --> 00:08:59.873
And it was an amazing collaboration

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.526
to work with this great artist whom I admire.

00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:06.214
But then, you know, eventually you have to turn

00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:08.238
all these drawings into reality.

00:09:08.238 --> 00:09:11.367
So, again, my solution was to aim

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:14.474
for the best possible artist that I could think of.

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:17.875
And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:21.857
called Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:25.339
This guy had been lead compositor on such films

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:28.286
as "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:30.519
and other unknown projects like this,

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:33.433
and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,

00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:34.976
and I had to convince him,

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:38.407
and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.463
he accepted to work on mine.

00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:44.250
Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.664
So if you don't have money to offer to people,

00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:50.879
you must strike their imagination with something

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.391
as nice as you can think of.

00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:55.767
So this is what happened on this movie,

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:57.108
and that's how it got made,

00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:00.239
and we went to this very nice postproduction company

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:02.311
in Montreal called Vision Globale,

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:06.948
and they lent their 60 artists to work full time

00:10:06.948 --> 00:10:09.894
for six months to do this crazy film.

00:10:09.894 --> 00:10:14.683
So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas

00:10:14.683 --> 00:10:16.356
in your mind, and that people tell you

00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:17.843
that it's impossible to make,

00:10:17.843 --> 00:10:20.438
well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,

00:10:20.438 --> 00:10:22.538
because people have a tendency

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.869
to see the problems rather than the final result,

00:10:25.869 --> 00:10:28.651
whereas if you start to deal with problems

00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:31.453
as being your allies rather than your opponents,

00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:33.964
life will start to dance with you

00:10:33.964 --> 00:10:35.520
in the most amazing way.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.208
I have experienced it.

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.267
And you might end up doing some crazy projects,

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:43.206
and who knows, you might even end up

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:45.470
going to Mars.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.171
Thank you.

00:10:47.171 --> 00:10:50.386
(Applause)
