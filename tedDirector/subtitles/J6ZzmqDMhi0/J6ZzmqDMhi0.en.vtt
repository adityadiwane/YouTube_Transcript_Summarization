00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:15.076
So in my free time outside of Twitter

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:16.527
I experiment a little bit

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.150
with telling stories online, experimenting

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.573
with what we can do with new digital tools.

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:23.079
And in my job at Twitter,

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.695
I actually spent a little bit of time

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:27.439
working with authors and storytellers as well,

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.644
helping to expand out the bounds

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:31.954
of what people are experimenting with.

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:34.324
And I want to talk through some examples today

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:35.733
of things that people have done

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.902
that I think are really fascinating

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:41.037
using flexible identity and anonymity on the web

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:45.110
and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.262
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:49.573
Long before a little thing called Twitter,

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:52.614
radio brought us broadcasts

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:55.498
and connected millions of people

00:00:55.498 --> 00:00:57.939
to single points of broadcast.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.961
And from those single points emanated stories.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.950
Some of them were familiar stories.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.415
Some of them were new stories.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.414
And for a while they were familiar formats,

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.635
but then radio began to evolve its own

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.566
unique formats specific to that medium.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.250
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.573
Combining the live play

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:21.934
and the serialization of written fiction,

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.119
you get this new format.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.048
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think

00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:30.173
radio is a great example of how a new medium

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.980
defines new formats which then define new stories.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.916
And of course, today, we have an entirely new

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:38.517
medium to play with,

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:39.943
which is this online world.

00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:43.807
This is the map of verified users on Twitter

00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:45.113
and the connections between them.

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:47.880
There are thousands upon thousands of them.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.475
Every single one of these points

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.357
is its own broadcaster.

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:55.030
We've gone to this world of many to many,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.795
where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.368
And I think that we should start to see

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.053
wildly new formats emerge

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:07.961
as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.313
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:13.501
for creative experimentation, if you will,

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.850
that we've explored and begun to settle

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.829
this wild land of the Internet

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.072
and are now just getting ready

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:23.154
to start to build structures on it,

00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:25.241
and those structures are the new formats

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:29.794
of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:32.099
I believe this starts with an evolution

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.993
of existing methods.

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:35.756
The short story, for example,

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.218
people are saying that the short story

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:39.993
is experiencing a renaissance of sorts

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.392
thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:46.470
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.191
with short stories on Amazon

00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:52.723
by releasing one very short story called "Wool."

00:02:52.723 --> 00:02:55.225
And he actually says that he didn't intend

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:56.570
for "Wool" to become a series,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.196
but that the audience loved the first story so much

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.607
they demanded more, and so he gave them more.

00:03:01.607 --> 00:03:05.111
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.105
"Wool 3," which was even longer,

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.895
culminating in "Wool 5,"

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:11.736
which was a 60,000-word novel.

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:15.721
I think Howey was able to do all of this because

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.664
he had the quick feedback system of e-books.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.466
He was able to write and publish

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.055
in relatively short order.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:25.152
There was no mediator between him and the audience.

00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:27.958
It was just him directly connected with his audience

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.107
and building on the feedback and enthusiasm

00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:31.928
that they were giving him.

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:33.813
So this whole project was an experiment.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.920
It started with the one short story,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.049
and I think the experimentation actually became

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.377
a part of Howey's format.

00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:43.616
And that's something that this medium enabled,

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.793
was experimentation being a part of the format itself.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:50.964
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.412
called "Black Box."

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:53.919
It was originally written

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.600
specifically with Twitter in mind.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.909
Egan convinced The New Yorker

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.331
to start a New Yorker fiction account

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:02.148
from which they could tweet

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:03.952
all of these lines that she created.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.399
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.240
Egan mocked that up just writing manually

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.156
in this storyboard sketchbook,

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:16.143
used the physical space constraints

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:17.652
of those storyboard squares

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:19.453
to write each individual tweet,

00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:22.392
and those tweets ended up becoming

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:26.080
over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.850
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.418
to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:34.962
I think that's pretty exciting:

00:04:34.962 --> 00:04:37.468
tune-in literary fiction.

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:40.529
The experience of Egan's story, of course,

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.578
like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.

00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:45.117
You could scroll back through it,

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:48.000
but interestingly, if you were watching it live,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.631
there was this suspense that built

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:53.148
because the actual tweets,

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:55.451
you had no control over when you would read them.

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.891
They were coming at a pretty regular clip,

00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:00.269
but as the story was building,

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.512
normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,

00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:05.823
but in this case, The New Yorker did,

00:05:05.823 --> 00:05:08.993
and they were sending you bit by bit by bit,

00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:12.275
and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.

00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:15.346
Another great example of fiction

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:17.390
and the short story on Twitter,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.813
Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."

00:05:20.813 --> 00:05:23.443
It began with this tweet: "On November 28

00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:25.594
at 10:13 p.m.,

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:27.669
a woman identified as Miranda Brown,

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.499
44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:32.865
from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.595
It begins in Elliott's voice,

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.336
but then Elliott's voice recedes,

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.718
and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,

00:05:39.718 --> 00:05:42.817
characters that Elliott created on Twitter

00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:44.546
specifically to tell this story,

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.160
a story from multiple perspectives

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.285
leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.563
when this woman falls to her death.

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:55.667
These three characters brought an authentic vision

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.389
from multiple perspectives.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.715
One reviewer called Elliott's story

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.605
"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.

00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:04.333
She captured that voice

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:07.521
and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.220
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.384
Twitter as a distribution mechanism.

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.528
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.

00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:15.772
Elliott told me later

00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:19.819
she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.622
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth

00:06:23.622 --> 00:06:25.471
between different characters

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:28.084
tweeting out each line, line by line.

00:06:28.084 --> 00:06:30.837
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation

00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:33.353
of what was coming out of the characters' voices

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:36.462
really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.140
but also to this format that she had created

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.753
of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:46.480
As you begin to play with flexible identity online,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.777
it gets even more interesting

00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:49.722
as you start to interact with the real world.

00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:51.626
Things like Invisible Obama

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:53.867
or the famous "binders full of women"

00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:56.413
that came up during the 2012 election cycle,

00:06:56.413 --> 00:07:00.584
or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:02.694
in which you have all of these accounts

00:07:02.694 --> 00:07:05.670
for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,"

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.573
including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window

00:07:09.573 --> 00:07:13.709
in one single episode. (Laughter)

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.845
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.

00:07:16.845 --> 00:07:19.161
They are creative people experimenting

00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:22.217
with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.970
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.370
in which you have these fictional characters

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.328
that engage with the real world.

00:07:28.328 --> 00:07:30.120
They comment on politics,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.654
they cry out against the evils of Congress.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.438
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.

00:07:36.438 --> 00:07:39.758
And they engage with the real world.

00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.616
They respond to it.

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:43.761
So once you take flexible identity,

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.460
anonymity, engagement with the real world,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.631
and you move beyond simple homage or parody

00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:53.220
and you put these tools to work in telling a story,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.103
that's when things get really interesting.

00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:57.912
So during the Chicago mayoral election

00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.480
there was a parody account.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.894
It was Mayor Emanuel.

00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:04.360
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.680
particularly in the expletive department.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.759
This foul-mouthed account

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.646
followed the daily activities of the race,

00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:15.326
providing commentary as it went.

00:08:15.326 --> 00:08:17.807
It followed all of the natural tropes

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:20.189
of a good, solid Twitter parody account,

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:23.871
but then started to get weird.

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.244
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary

00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:32.512
to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.600
in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.757
engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,

00:08:39.757 --> 00:08:42.370
which is -- it didn't actually happen.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.788
I double checked the newspapers.

00:08:45.788 --> 00:08:49.331
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.

00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.330
This is something that doesn't usually happen

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.791
with a Twitter parody account.

00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:56.520
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.742
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,

00:08:59.742 --> 00:09:02.077
who was completely anonymous this whole time,

00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:05.775
I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:07.359
to turn this into a book,

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.732
because it was a narrative format in the end,

00:09:10.732 --> 00:09:13.293
and I think that turning it into a book

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:16.991
is representative of this idea that he had created something new

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:20.617
that needed to be translated into previous formats.

00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:22.710
One of my favorite examples

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.706
of something that's happening on Twitter right now,

00:09:24.706 --> 00:09:29.482
actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:31.914
Crimer Show tells the story

00:09:31.914 --> 00:09:34.655
of a supercriminal and a hapless detective

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:38.340
that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.762
with all of the tropes of a television show.

00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:42.299
Crimer Show's creator has said that

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:47.291
it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,

00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:50.149
but, man, is it weird.

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:52.120
And there are all these times where Crimer,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.549
the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:09:56.801
He's always taking off his sunglasses

00:09:56.801 --> 00:09:59.769
or turning to the camera,

00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:02.209
but these things just happen in text.

00:10:02.209 --> 00:10:05.043
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:08.795
and additionally presenting each Crimer Show

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:14.028
as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,"

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:16.077
presenting them as episodes

00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:19.107
really, it creates something new.

00:10:19.107 --> 00:10:22.696
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:24.820
on Twitter pretty much every day,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.432
and they're archived that way.

00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:29.213
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.

00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:31.497
Something totally new has been created here

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:35.033
out of parodying something on television.

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.873
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,

00:10:37.873 --> 00:10:40.640
there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.589
RealTimeWWII is an account

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.652
that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago

00:10:46.652 --> 00:10:49.021
in exceptional detail, as if

00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.750
you were reading the news reports from that day.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.505
And the author Teju Cole has done

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:56.916
a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist

00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:58.544
on events of the news.

00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:02.987
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.

00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:05.587
I think that in both of these examples,

00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:07.228
you're beginning to see ways in which

00:11:07.228 --> 00:11:10.052
people are telling stories with nonfiction content

00:11:10.052 --> 00:11:12.961
that can be built into new types

00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:15.522
of fictional storytelling.

00:11:15.522 --> 00:11:18.084
So with real-time storytelling,

00:11:18.084 --> 00:11:20.613
blurring the lines between fact and fiction,

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.690
the real world and the digital world,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.472
flexible identity, anonymity,

00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:29.993
these are all tools that we have accessible to us,

00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:31.885
and I think that they're just the building blocks.

00:11:31.885 --> 00:11:34.523
They are the bits that we use

00:11:34.523 --> 00:11:37.160
to create the structures, the frames,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.258
that then become our settlements on this

00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:43.018
wide open frontier for creative experimentation.

00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:44.469
Thank you.

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:49.223
(Applause)
