00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
As an Indian, and now as a politician

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and a government minister,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I've become rather concerned about

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
the hype we're hearing about our own country,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
even the next superpower.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
In fact, the American publishers of my book,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
"India: The next 21st-century power."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
or should be all about.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
seems to me terribly archaic.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's redolent of James Bond movies

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and Kipling ballads.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
After all, what constitutes a world leader?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
We will overtake China by 2034.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
The Americans have even recognized it,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
in an agreement.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Is it the economy? Well, we have now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
the fifth-largest economy in the world

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
in purchasing power parity terms.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
we grew at 6.7 percent.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.260
to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
in this part of the 21st century.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And so I wondered, could

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
what the future beckons for India to be all about

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
be a combination of these things allied to something else,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
the power of example,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
the attraction of India's culture,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.260
what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
because of its culture, its political values,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
its foreign policies.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
but we know the Alliance Francaise

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
is all about French soft power, the British Council.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But, the fact is, in fact,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
have done more for American soft power

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
around the world than any specifically government activity.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So soft power is something that really emerges

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
partly because of governments,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
but partly despite governments.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And in the information era we all live in today,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
what we might call the TED age,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
by a global public that's been fed

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
on an incessant diet of Internet news,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of televised images,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
of cellphone videos, of email gossip.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
In other words, all sorts of communication devices

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
are telling us the stories of countries,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Now, in this age, again, countries with access

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
to multiple channels of communication

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and information have a particular advantage.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
India has more all-news TV channels

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
than any country in the world,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
But, the fact still is that it's not just that.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
One might argue that India has become

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
an astonishingly connected country.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I think you've already heard the figures.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Currently there are 509 million cellphones

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in Indian hands, in India.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
In fact, those 15 million cellphones

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
are the most connections that any country,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
including the U.S. and China,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
has ever established in the history of telecommunications.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
But, what perhaps some of you don't realize

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is how far we've come to get there.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
You know, when I grew up in India,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
telephones were a rarity.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
as a favor to those they deemed worthy.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
But sometimes it just sat there.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I went to high school in Calcutta.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
But half the time we would pick it up

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
with an expectant look on our faces,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
there would be no dial tone.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.260
(Laughter)

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
If you then wanted to connect to another city,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
you'd have to book something called a trunk call,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Or you could pay eight times the going rate

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
for something called a lightning call.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.260
so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.260
that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
that in a developing country

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
communications are a luxury, not a right,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that the government had no obligation to provide better service,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
for telephones in India.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the 15 million cell phones a month.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
wielding a coal-fired steam iron

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that might have been invented in the 18th century.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.260
to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
at the country farm of a friend,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and a voice said, "I'm up here."

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
was a local toddy tapper,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
to find out where they get the best possible prices.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
to find out if the market town was open,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
if the market was on,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
to the market town to get that information and come back,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
then they'd load the cart.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So this empowerment of the underclass

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
is the real result of India being connected.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.260
(Laughter)

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
but, having said that,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
the fact is that Bollywood is now

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.260
taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.260
but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
in a village in Senegal

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
just to watch a Bollywood movie.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
She can't understand the dialogue.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And this is happening more and more.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
India doesn't have a military mission there.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.260
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
One simple fact:

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Why? Because that was the moment

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
when the Indian television soap opera,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.260
"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Weddings were reported to be interrupted

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
any moving part they could find, at 8:30,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.260
(Laughter)

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.260
That's soft power. And that is what India is developing

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
through the "E" part of TED:

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
its own entertainment industry.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
but it's true of our music, of our dance,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.260
of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
But, today in Britain, for example,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Indian restaurants in Britain

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
employ more people than the coal mining,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
ship building and iron and steel industries combined.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So the empire can strike back.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:31.260
(Applause)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
But, with this increasing awareness of India,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
with you and with I, and so on,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
with tales like Afghanistan,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
comes something vital in the information era,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
the sense that in today's world

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
as a student in the mid '70s,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
I had a friend, a history major like me,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
by an anxiously perspiring European saying,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
(Laughter)

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
We've gone from the image of India as

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
computer wizards, software gurus.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.260
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
But, there is something more substantive to that.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
The story rests on a fundamental platform

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
of political pluralism.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It's a civilizational story to begin with.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Because India has been an open society for millennia.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.260
India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.260
In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
somewhere around 52 A.D.,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
a single incident of anti-semitism.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.260
(Applause)

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
That's the Indian story.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Islam came peacefully to the south,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
slightly more differently complicated history in the north.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.260
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
keeps growing by 20 million a year.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
But, the fact is

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that the last elections, five years ago,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
gave the world extraordinary phenomenon

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
of an election being won by a woman political leader

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
to be sworn in as Prime Minister

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
in a country 81 percent Hindu.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:28.260
(Applause)

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
This is India, and of course it's all the more striking

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
because it was four years later that we all applauded

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.260
the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
more than 220 years of free and fair elections,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260
which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
who wasn't white, male or Christian.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and he is male, but he isn't white.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
All the others have been all those three.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
(Laughter)

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
All his predecessors have been all those three,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and that's the point I was trying to make.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.260
(Laughter)

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
But, the issue is

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
that when I talked about that example,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.260
it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Because ultimately, that electoral outcome

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
had nothing to do with the rest of the world.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
It was essentially India being itself.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And ultimately, it seems to me,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
that always works better than propaganda.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
But people see a society for what it is,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.260
will make a difference in today's information era,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
in today's TED age.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So India now is no longer

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.260
the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
we've every religion know to mankind,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
with the possible exception of Shintoism,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.260
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And those of you who cashed your money here

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
might be surprised to see how many scripts there are

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
We've got all of that.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
We don't even have geography uniting us,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
because the natural geography of the subcontinent

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
which flows in Pakistan.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
But, the whole point is that India

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
is the nationalism of an idea.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
emerging from an ancient civilization,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
united by a shared history,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.260
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
And it's the nationalism of an idea that

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.260
essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.260
color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and still rally around a consensus.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
And the consensus is of a very simple principle,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.260
that in a diverse plural democracy like India

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
so long as you agree on the ground rules

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
of how you will disagree.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
The great success story of India,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
a country that so many learned scholars and journalists

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:21.260
is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
And I do want to make the point

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
it isn't military muscle, economic power.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
All of that is necessary,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
We can't really be both of those.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
hardware of development,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
the ports, the roads, the airports,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
all the infrastructural things we need to do,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
and the software of development,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.260
the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
to be able to send his or her children

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
to a decent school,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and to aspire to work a job

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
that will give them opportunities in their lives

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
that can transform themselves.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.260
But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
But, it's all taking place in an open society,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
the creative energies of its people.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
That's why India belongs at TED,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
and that's why TED belongs in India.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:48.260
(Applause)
