00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.485
We're seen as the organization that is
the bucket for failed social policy.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.767
I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.903
We get the people for whom
nothing else has worked,

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:23.341
people who have fallen through all

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.254
of the other social safety nets.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.587
They can't contain them, so we must.

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:29.030
That's our job:

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.137
contain them, control them.

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:34.594
Over the years, as a prison system,

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:36.415
as a nation, and as a society,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:37.890
we've become very good at that,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010
but that shouldn't make you happy.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.710
Today we incarcerate more people per capita

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.847
than any other country in the world.

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:45.760
We have more black men in prison today

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.321
than were under slavery in 1850.

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:50.081
We house the parents of almost three million

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:51.805
of our community's children,

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:53.825
and we've become the new asylum,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.862
the largest mental health provider in this nation.

00:00:56.862 --> 00:00:58.333
When we lock someone up,

00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.964
that is no small thing.

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:03.122
And yet, we are called the
Department of Corrections.

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:04.510
Today I want to talk about

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.605
changing the way we think about corrections.

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.664
I believe, and my experience tells me,

00:01:08.664 --> 00:01:10.373
that when we change the way we think,

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:13.207
we create new possibilities, or futures,

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:15.833
and prisons need a different future.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.305
I've spent my entire career
in corrections, over 30 years.

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:20.785
I followed my dad into this field.

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:23.930
He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.940
He was strong, steady, disciplined.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.380
I was not so much any of those things,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.779
and I'm sure that worried him about me.

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:33.622
Eventually I decided, if I was
going to end up in prison,

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:34.943
I'd better end up on the right side of the bars,

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:36.650
so I thought I'd check it out,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.920
take a tour of the place my dad worked,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.101
the McNeil Island Penitentiary.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.811
Now this was the early '80s,

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.338
and prisons weren't quite what you see

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.320
on TV or in the movies.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.840
In many ways, it was worse.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.454
I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:53.079
There were eight men to a cell.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.427
there were 550 men in that living unit.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:57.310
And just in case you wondered,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.376
they shared one toilet in those small confines.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:01.879
An officer put a key in a lockbox,

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.421
and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:06.400
Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.763
I walked away as fast as I could.

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:11.361
Eventually I went back and
I started as an officer there.

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:13.158
My job was to run one of those cell blocks

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:16.319
and to control those hundreds of men.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.164
When I went to work at our receptions center,

00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:20.890
I could actually hear the inmates 
roiling from the parking lot,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.384
shaking cell doors, yelling,

00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:25.058
tearing up their cells.

00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:27.422
Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:29.186
and what you get is chaos.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:31.959
Contain and control â€” that was our job.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.280
One way we learned to do this more effectively

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.490
was a new type of housing unit

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.193
called the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:40.016
a modern version of a "hole."

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:42.538
We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.819
with cuff ports so we could restrain them

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.160
and feed them.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.497
Guess what?

00:02:48.497 --> 00:02:49.991
It got quieter.

00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:52.488
Disturbances died down in the general population.

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:53.839
Places became safer

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.439
because those inmates who
were most violent or disruptive

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.864
could now be isolated.

00:02:57.864 --> 00:02:59.595
But isolation isn't good.

00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:02.424
Deprive people of social
contact and they deteriorate.

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.359
It was hard getting them out of IMU,

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.912
for them and for us.

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:09.381
Even in prison, it's no small thing

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.367
to lock someone up.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:13.921
My next assignment was to one
of the state's deep-end prisons

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.856
where some of our more violent
or disruptive inmates are housed.

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:18.700
By then, the industry had advanced a lot,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.758
and we had different tools and techniques

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:22.795
to manage disruptive behavior.

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:25.020
We had beanbag guns and pepper spray

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.910
and plexiglass shields,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.345
flash bangs, emergency response teams.

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:31.209
We met violence with force

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.670
and chaos with chaos.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.197
We were pretty good at putting out fires.

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.498
While I was there, I met two
experienced correctional workers

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:40.034
who were also researchers,

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:43.225
an anthropologist and a sociologist.

00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:44.775
One day, one of them commented to me and said,

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:46.813
"You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:50.647
Have you ever thought about how to prevent them?"

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.624
I was patient with them,

00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:53.933
explaining our brute force approach

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.790
to making prisons safer.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.324
They were patient with me.

00:03:57.324 --> 00:03:59.501
Out of those conversations grew some new ideas

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.397
and we started some small experiments.

00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:03.798
First, we started training our officers in teams

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:07.040
rather than sending them one or two
at a time to the state training academy.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.350
Instead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.627
Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:15.200
where we paired new staff with veteran staff.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.713
They both got better at the work.

00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:20.323
Second, we added verbal de-escalation skills

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.213
into the training continuum

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.950
and made it part of the use of force continuum.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.434
It was the non-force use of force.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.036
And then we did something even more radical.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.346
We trained the inmates on those same skills.

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:33.642
We changed the skill set,

00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:36.813
reducing violence, not just responding to it.

00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:40.047
Third, when we expanded our facility, 
we tried a new type of design.

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:42.752
Now the biggest and most controversial component

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:46.429
of this design, of course, was the toilet.

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:48.118
There were no toilets.

00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:50.749
Now that might not sound
significant to you here today,

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.134
but at the time, it was huge.

00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:54.247
No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.

00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:56.495
We all thought it was dangerous and crazy.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:59.602
Even eight men to a cell had a toilet.

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:02.459
That small detail changed the way we worked.

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:04.189
Inmates and staff started interacting

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.463
more often and openly and developing a rapport.

00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:09.296
It was easier to detect conflict and intervene

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.610
before it escalated.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.246
The unit was cleaner, quieter,
safer and more humane.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.451
This was more effective at keeping the peace

00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.960
than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.388
Interacting changes the way you behave,

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.494
both for the officer and the inmate.

00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:26.644
We changed the environment
and we changed the behavior.

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:28.537
Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.947
they assigned me to headquarters next,

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:33.473
and that's where I ran straight
up against system change.

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.042
Now, many things work against system change:

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:38.151
politics and politicians, bills and laws,

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:40.919
courts and lawsuits, internal politics.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.989
System change is difficult and slow,

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:44.531
and oftentimes it doesn't take you

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:46.214
where you want to go.

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:50.236
It's no small thing to change a prison system.

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:52.910
So what I did do is I reflected
on my earlier experiences

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.164
and I remembered that when we interacted
with offenders, the heat went down.

00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:58.155
When we changed the environment,
the behavior changed.

00:05:58.155 --> 00:05:59.944
And these were not huge system changes.

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:01.699
These were small changes, and these changes

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.910
created new possibilities.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.617
So next, I got reassigned as
superintendent of a small prison.

00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:08.876
And at the same time, I was working on my degree

00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:10.957
at the Evergreen State College.

00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:12.950
I interacted with a lot of
people who were not like me,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.320
people who had different ideas

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.026
and came from different backgrounds.

00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:18.622
One of them was a rainforest ecologist.

00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:20.372
She looked at my small prison and what she saw

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.158
was a laboratory.

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:25.083
We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:27.115
could actually help advance science

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:28.744
by helping them complete projects

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:30.555
they couldn't complete on their own,

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:32.873
like repopulating endangered species:

00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:36.020
frogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.347
At the same time, we found ways to make

00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:38.930
our operation more efficient

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.153
through the addition of solar power,

00:06:41.153 --> 00:06:44.683
rainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.

00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:47.182
This initiative has led to many projects

00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:48.884
that have had huge system-wide impact,

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:52.227
not just in our system, but in 
other state systems as well,

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:54.423
small experiments making a big difference

00:06:54.423 --> 00:06:57.475
to science, to the community.

00:06:57.475 --> 00:07:00.642
The way we think about our work changes our work.

00:07:00.642 --> 00:07:03.823
The project just made my job
more interesting and exciting.

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.780
I was excited. Staff were excited.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.790
Officers were excited. Inmates were excited.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.543
They were inspired.

00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:11.099
Everybody wanted to be part of this.

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.418
They were making a contribution, a difference,

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:15.657
one they thought was meaningful and important.

00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:17.513
Let me be clear on what's going on here, though.

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:19.256
Inmates are highly adaptive.

00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:20.928
They have to be.

00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:23.689
Oftentimes, they know more about our own systems

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.670
than the people who run them.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.321
And they're here for a reason.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.607
I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,

00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:31.870
but I do think they can have

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.623
decent and meaningful lives even in prison.

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:36.200
So that was the question:

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.380
Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives,

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.650
and if so, what difference would that make?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.547
So I took that question back to the deep end,

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:48.212
where some of our most
violent offenders are housed.

00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:49.843
Remember, IMUs are for punishment.

00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:51.907
You don't get perks there, like programming.

00:07:51.907 --> 00:07:53.837
That was how we thought.

00:07:53.837 --> 00:07:55.950
But then we started to realize that if any inmates

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.237
needed programming, it
was these particular inmates.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:00.423
In fact, they needed intensive programming.

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:02.761
So we changed our thinking 180 degrees,

00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:05.124
and we started looking for new possibilities.

00:08:05.124 --> 00:08:07.662
What we found was a new kind of chair.

00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:09.608
Instead of using the chair for punishment,

00:08:09.608 --> 00:08:11.278
we put it in classrooms.

00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:14.330
Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.559
but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:18.205
with other inmates and staff,

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:19.840
and because control was no longer an issue,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.130
everybody could focus on other things,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.761
like learning. Behavior changed.

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:29.607
We changed our thinking, and we changed 
what was possible, and this gives me hope.

00:08:29.607 --> 00:08:32.143
Now, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.

00:08:32.143 --> 00:08:34.735
What I can tell you, though, it is working.

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:38.164
Our prisons are getting safer
for both staff and inmates,

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:39.558
and when our prisons are safe,

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:43.013
we can put our energies into
a lot more than just controlling.

00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:45.295
Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,

00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:46.970
but it's not our only goal.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.726
To be honest with you, preventing crime

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:50.695
takes so much more from so many more people

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:52.208
and institutions.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:55.476
If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:57.434
I'm afraid we'll never get there.

00:08:57.434 --> 00:08:59.289
But prisons can do some things

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.965
we never thought they could do.

00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:03.000
Prisons can be the source of innovation

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.381
and sustainability,

00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.740
repopulating endangered species
and environmental restoration.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.385
Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers,

00:09:10.385 --> 00:09:12.145
dog rescuers.

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:14.678
Prisons can be the source of meaningful work

00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:16.635
and opportunity for staff

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:18.976
and the inmates who live there.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:21.150
We can contain and control

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.273
and provide humane environments.

00:09:23.273 --> 00:09:25.864
These are not opposing qualities.

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:28.165
We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out

00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:29.752
if this is worth doing.

00:09:29.752 --> 00:09:32.446
Our strategy is not massive system change.

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:34.250
Our strategy is hundreds of small changes

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.935
that take place in days or months, not years.

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:41.332
We need more small pilots where we learn as we go,

00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:44.333
pilots that change the range of possibility.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.422
We need new and better ways to measure impacts

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:48.163
on engagement, on interaction,

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.179
on safe environments.

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:52.499
We need more opportunities to participate in

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:54.671
and contribute to our communities,

00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:57.120
your communities.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.164
Prisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.

00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.147
We can do that.

00:10:01.147 --> 00:10:03.168
Prisons need to provide humane environments

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:05.235
where people can participate, contribute,

00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:06.921
and learn meaningful lives.

00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:08.770
We're learning how to do that.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.220
That's why I'm hopeful.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.511
We don't have to stay stuck
in old ideas about prison.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.975
We can define that. We can create that.

00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:17.425
And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,

00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:19.362
prisons can be more than the bucket

00:10:19.362 --> 00:10:20.951
for failed social policy.

00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:24.301
Maybe finally, we will earn our title:

00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.296
a department of corrections.

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:28.396
Thank you.

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.927
(Applause)
