00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260
First, a video.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.459
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:30.744
But as you look at it,

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:34.879
I hope you'll begin to feel
just slightly uneasy.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.987
Because you may notice
that what's actually happening

00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:42.236
is that the egg is unscrambling itself.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.959
And you'll now see the yolk
and the white have separated.

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.006
And now they're going to be
poured back into the egg.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.498
And we all know in our heart of hearts

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:53.537
that this is not the way
the universe works.

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:57.801
A scrambled egg is mush --
tasty mush -- but it's mush.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:00.236
An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.499
that can create even more
sophisticated things,

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:03.840
such as chickens.

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:06.236
And we know in our heart of hearts

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.024
that the universe does not travel
from mush to complexity.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.845
In fact, this gut instinct

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.741
is reflected in one of the most
fundamental laws of physics,

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.590
the second law of thermodynamics,
or the law of entropy.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.921
What that says basically

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:24.072
is that the general
tendency of the universe

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:27.699
is to move from order and structure

00:01:27.723 --> 00:01:30.387
to lack of order, lack of structure --

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:31.875
in fact, to mush.

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.122
And that's why that video
feels a bit strange.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.414
And yet, look around us.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:42.930
What we see around us
is staggering complexity.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.838
Eric Beinhocker estimates
that in New York City alone,

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:50.416
there are some 10 billion SKUs,
or distinct commodities, being traded.

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:54.900
That's hundreds of times
as many species as there are on Earth.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.236
And they're being traded by a species
of almost seven billion individuals,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.645
who are linked by trade,
travel, and the Internet

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:06.358
into a global system
of stupendous complexity.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.302
So here's a great puzzle:

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:14.838
in a universe ruled
by the second law of thermodynamics,

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:16.666
how is it possible

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.236
to generate the sort
of complexity I've described,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.048
the sort of complexity
represented by you and me

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:24.761
and the convention center?

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.072
Well, the answer seems to be,

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:31.236
the universe can create complexity,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.815
but with great difficulty.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.967
In pockets,

00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:37.308
there appear
what my colleague, Fred Spier,

00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:39.474
calls "Goldilocks conditions" --

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:41.549
not too hot, not too cold,

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.236
just right for the creation of complexity.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.527
And slightly more complex things appear.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.790
And where you have
slightly more complex things,

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.186
you can get slightly more complex things.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.236
And in this way, complexity
builds stage by stage.

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.413
Each stage is magical

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:02.010
because it creates the impression
of something utterly new

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:04.837
appearing almost out of nowhere
in the universe.

00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:08.092
We refer in big history to these moments
as threshold moments.

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.236
And at each threshold,
the going gets tougher.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.502
The complex things get more fragile,

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:17.236
more vulnerable;

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.791
the Goldilocks conditions
get more stringent,

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:23.802
and it's more difficult
to create complexity.

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:28.032
Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:30.236
desperately need to know this story

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.918
of how the universe creates complexity
despite the second law,

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:39.974
and why complexity means
vulnerability and fragility.

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.665
And that's the story
that we tell in big history.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.396
But to do it, you have do something

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.125
that may, at first sight,
seem completely impossible.

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.329
You have to survey the whole
history of the universe.

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:53.748
So let's do it.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.169
(Laughter)

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:59.639
Let's begin by winding the timeline back

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:02.559
13.7 billion years,

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.260
to the beginning of time.

00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.235
Around us, there's nothing.

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:17.692
There's not even time or space.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:22.172
Imagine the darkest,
emptiest thing you can

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:25.513
and cube it a gazillion times
and that's where we are.

00:04:25.992 --> 00:04:28.332
And then suddenly,

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:29.364
bang!

00:04:29.388 --> 00:04:31.595
A universe appears, an entire universe.

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.475
And we've crossed our first threshold.

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.872
The universe is tiny;
it's smaller than an atom.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.236
It's incredibly hot.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.785
It contains everything
that's in today's universe,

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.603
so you can imagine, it's busting.

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.236
And it's expanding at incredible speed.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.173
And at first, it's just a blur,

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:49.307
but very quickly distinct things
begin to appear in that blur.

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:51.236
Within the first second,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.236
energy itself shatters
into distinct forces

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.342
including electromagnetism and gravity.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.794
And energy does something
else quite magical:

00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:03.050
it congeals to form matter --

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.404
quarks that will create protons

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:07.566
and leptons that include electrons.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.693
And all of that happens
in the first second.

00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:13.946
Now we move forward 380,000 years.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.907
That's twice as long as humans
have been on this planet.

00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:22.671
And now simple atoms appear
of hydrogen and helium.

00:05:23.877 --> 00:05:25.480
Now I want to pause for a moment,

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:28.236
380,000 years after the origins
of the universe,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.236
because we actually know quite a lot
about the universe at this stage.

00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:35.694
We know above all
that it was extremely simple.

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:39.517
It consisted of huge clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms,

00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.469
and they have no structure.

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:43.860
They're really a sort of cosmic mush.

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:46.322
But that's not completely true.

00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:48.236
Recent studies

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.121
by satellites such as the WMAP satellite

00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:52.722
have shown that, in fact,

00:05:52.746 --> 00:05:55.495
there are just tiny differences
in that background.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.236
What you see here,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.566
the blue areas are about a thousandth
of a degree cooler

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.982
than the red areas.

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:04.379
These are tiny differences,

00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:06.673
but it was enough
for the universe to move on

00:06:06.697 --> 00:06:08.672
to the next stage of building complexity.

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:09.888
And this is how it works.

00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:15.143
Gravity is more powerful
where there's more stuff.

00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:18.135
So where you get slightly denser areas,

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.076
gravity starts compacting clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.650
So we can imagine the early universe
breaking up into a billion clouds.

00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:27.476
And each cloud is compacted,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.516
gravity gets more powerful
as density increases,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.634
the temperature begins to rise
at the center of each cloud,

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:34.947
and then, at the center,

00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.809
the temperature crosses
the threshold temperature

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.399
of 10 million degrees,

00:06:39.423 --> 00:06:41.828
protons start to fuse,

00:06:41.852 --> 00:06:44.236
there's a huge release of energy,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.693
and --

00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:46.733
bam!

00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:48.272
We have our first stars.

00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:52.796
From about 200 million years
after the Big Bang,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.227
stars begin to appear
all through the universe,

00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:57.322
billions of them.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.615
And the universe is now
significantly more interesting

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.734
and more complex.

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:06.304
Stars will create
the Goldilocks conditions

00:07:06.328 --> 00:07:08.227
for crossing two new thresholds.

00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.210
When very large stars die,

00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:13.555
they create temperatures so high

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:17.212
that protons begin to fuse
in all sorts of exotic combinations,

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:20.066
to form all the elements
of the periodic table.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.386
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.236
it was forged in a supernova explosion.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:29.077
So now the universe
is chemically more complex.

00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:31.466
And in a chemically more complex universe,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.934
it's possible to make more things.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.450
And what starts happening
is that, around young suns,

00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:39.236
young stars,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.451
all these elements combine,
they swirl around,

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:44.255
the energy of the star stirs them around,

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:49.004
they form particles, they form snowflakes,
they form little dust motes,

00:07:49.028 --> 00:07:51.224
they form rocks, they form asteroids,

00:07:51.248 --> 00:07:53.843
and eventually,
they form planets and moons.

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.817
And that is how our
solar system was formed,

00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.236
four and a half billion years ago.

00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:05.826
Rocky planets like our Earth
are significantly more complex than stars

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.612
because they contain
a much greater diversity of materials.

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:11.417
So we've crossed a fourth
threshold of complexity.

00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:15.558
Now, the going gets tougher.

00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:20.689
The next stage introduces entities
that are significantly more fragile,

00:08:20.713 --> 00:08:22.625
significantly more vulnerable,

00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:25.236
but they're also much more creative

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.236
and much more capable
of generating further complexity.

00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:32.030
I'm talking, of course,
about living organisms.

00:08:32.734 --> 00:08:34.877
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:37.284
We are huge packages of chemicals.

00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:41.236
So, chemistry is dominated
by the electromagnetic force.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.499
That operates over smaller
scales than gravity,

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:47.438
which explains why you and I
are smaller than stars or planets.

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:50.327
Now, what are the ideal
conditions for chemistry?

00:08:50.874 --> 00:08:52.644
What are the Goldilocks conditions?

00:08:52.668 --> 00:08:55.025
Well, first, you need energy,

00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:56.236
but not too much.

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:58.920
In the center of a star,
there's so much energy

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:02.086
that any atoms that combine
will just get busted apart again.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.236
But not too little.

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:04.873
In intergalactic space,

00:09:04.897 --> 00:09:07.780
there's so little energy
that atoms can't combine.

00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:10.236
What you want is just the right amount,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and planets, it turns out, are just right,

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:14.791
because they're close to stars,
but not too close.

00:09:15.394 --> 00:09:18.989
You also need a great diversity
of chemical elements,

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:22.021
and you need liquids, such as water.

00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:23.092
Why?

00:09:23.116 --> 00:09:26.988
Well, in gases, atoms move
past each other so fast

00:09:27.012 --> 00:09:28.465
that they can't hitch up.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.672
In solids,

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:33.236
atoms are stuck together, they can't move.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.978
In liquids,

00:09:35.002 --> 00:09:38.040
they can cruise and cuddle

00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:40.366
and link up to form molecules.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.395
Now, where do you find
such Goldilocks conditions?

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.926
Well, planets are great,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.236
and our early Earth was almost perfect.

00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:52.085
It was just the right
distance from its star

00:09:52.109 --> 00:09:54.236
to contain huge oceans of liquid water.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.236
And deep beneath those oceans,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.236
at cracks in the Earth's crust,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.236
you've got heat seeping up
from inside the Earth,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.387
and you've got a great
diversity of elements.

00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.957
So at those deep oceanic vents,

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:08.236
fantastic chemistry began to happen,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and atoms combined in all sorts
of exotic combinations.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.625
But of course, life is more
than just exotic chemistry.

00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:20.811
How do you stabilize those huge molecules

00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.192
that seem to be viable?

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.306
Well, it's here that life introduces
an entirely new trick.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.755
You don't stabilize the individual;

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.882
you stabilize the template,

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:35.011
the thing that carries information,

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:37.252
and you allow the template to copy itself.

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:40.427
And DNA, of course,
is the beautiful molecule

00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:42.777
that contains that information.

00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:45.616
You'll be familiar
with the double helix of DNA.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.156
Each rung contains information.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.753
So, DNA contains information
about how to make living organisms.

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:55.239
And DNA also copies itself.

00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.469
So, it copies itself

00:10:56.493 --> 00:10:59.175
and scatters the templates
through the ocean.

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:00.993
So the information spreads.

00:11:01.017 --> 00:11:03.655
Notice that information
has become part of our story.

00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:07.782
The real beauty of DNA though
is in its imperfections.

00:11:07.806 --> 00:11:11.734
As it copies itself,
once in every billion rungs,

00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.503
there tends to be an error.

00:11:13.527 --> 00:11:18.236
And what that means
is that DNA is, in effect, learning.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.580
It's accumulating new ways
of making living organisms

00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:23.224
because some of those errors work.

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:24.446
So DNA's learning

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.704
and it's building greater
diversity and greater complexity.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:30.910
And we can see this happening
over the last four billion years.

00:11:30.934 --> 00:11:33.109
For most of that time of life on Earth,

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:35.370
living organisms have been
relatively simple --

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:36.782
single cells.

00:11:36.806 --> 00:11:40.236
But they had great diversity,
and, inside, great complexity.

00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:43.575
Then from about 600
to 800 million years ago,

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:45.690
multi-celled organisms appear.

00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:48.215
You get fungi, you get fish,

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:49.754
you get plants,

00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:52.489
you get amphibia, you get reptiles,

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.943
and then, of course,
you get the dinosaurs.

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:58.508
And occasionally, there are disasters.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.975
Sixty-five million years ago,

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.963
an asteroid landed on Earth

00:12:03.987 --> 00:12:05.777
near the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.769
creating conditions equivalent
to those of a nuclear war,

00:12:08.793 --> 00:12:10.682
and the dinosaurs were wiped out.

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:14.236
Terrible news for the dinosaurs,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.015
but great news
for our mammalian ancestors,

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:19.236
who flourished

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.917
in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.

00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:27.996
And we human beings are part
of that creative evolutionary pulse

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.356
that began 65 million years ago

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.260
with the landing of an asteroid.

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:36.510
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:40.882
And I believe we count
as a threshold in this great story.

00:12:40.906 --> 00:12:42.113
Let me explain why.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.731
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:47.542
it accumulates information.

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:49.236
But it is so slow.

00:12:50.128 --> 00:12:53.600
DNA accumulates information
through random errors,

00:12:53.624 --> 00:12:55.760
some of which just happen to work.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.124
But DNA had actually generated
a faster way of learning:

00:12:59.148 --> 00:13:01.926
it had produced organisms with brains,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.169
and those organisms
can learn in real time.

00:13:05.193 --> 00:13:07.519
They accumulate information, they learn.

00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:10.368
The sad thing is, when they die,

00:13:10.392 --> 00:13:12.090
the information dies with them.

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:16.466
Now what makes humans different
is human language.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.253
We are blessed with a language,
a system of communication,

00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:21.898
so powerful and so precise

00:13:21.922 --> 00:13:25.080
that we can share what we've learned
with such precision

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.993
that it can accumulate
in the collective memory.

00:13:28.017 --> 00:13:29.236
And that means

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.039
it can outlast the individuals
who learned that information,

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.236
and it can accumulate
from generation to generation.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.316
And that's why, as a species,
we're so creative and so powerful,

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.396
and that's why we have a history.

00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:46.316
We seem to be the only species
in four billion years

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.582
to have this gift.

00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:51.622
I call this ability collective learning.

00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:53.384
It's what makes us different.

00:13:53.686 --> 00:13:57.236
We can see it at work
in the earliest stages of human history.

00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:01.236
We evolved as a species
in the savanna lands of Africa,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.720
but then you see humans migrating
into new environments,

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.894
into desert lands, into jungles,

00:14:06.918 --> 00:14:09.354
into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --

00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:10.823
tough, tough environment --

00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:13.180
into the Americas, into Australasia.

00:14:13.204 --> 00:14:15.241
Each migration involved learning --

00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:17.748
learning new ways of exploiting
the environment,

00:14:17.772 --> 00:14:19.946
new ways of dealing
with their surroundings.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.786
Then 10,000 years ago,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.805
exploiting a sudden
change in global climate

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:26.401
with the end of the last ice age,

00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:28.006
humans learned to farm.

00:14:28.623 --> 00:14:31.059
Farming was an energy bonanza.

00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:34.910
And exploiting that energy,
human populations multiplied.

00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:38.521
Human societies got larger,
denser, more interconnected.

00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:42.452
And then from about 500 years ago,

00:14:42.476 --> 00:14:44.515
humans began to link up globally

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:46.920
through shipping, through trains,

00:14:46.944 --> 00:14:49.236
through telegraph, through the Internet,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.451
until now we seem to form
a single global brain

00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:56.607
of almost seven billion individuals.

00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.793
And that brain is learning at warp speed.

00:15:00.572 --> 00:15:03.144
And in the last 200 years,
something else has happened.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.834
We've stumbled on another energy bonanza

00:15:05.858 --> 00:15:06.985
in fossil fuels.

00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:09.712
So fossil fuels and collective
learning together

00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:13.260
explain the staggering complexity
we see around us.

00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:17.505
So --

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.985
Here we are,

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:21.533
back at the convention center.

00:15:21.557 --> 00:15:26.263
We've been on a journey,
a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:29.436
I hope you agree this is a powerful story.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.125
And it's a story in which humans
play an astonishing and creative role.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.681
But it also contains warnings.

00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:41.807
Collective learning is a very,
very powerful force,

00:15:41.831 --> 00:15:46.236
and it's not clear
that we humans are in charge of it.

00:15:47.123 --> 00:15:50.192
I remember very vividly
as a child growing up in England,

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.236
living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:56.458
For a few days, the entire biosphere

00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:58.781
seemed to be on the verge of destruction.

00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:02.639
And the same weapons are still here,

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:04.236
and they are still armed.

00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:08.236
If we avoid that trap,
others are waiting for us.

00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:11.236
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.671
that we seem to be undermining
the Goldilocks conditions

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:16.923
that made it possible
for human civilizations

00:16:16.947 --> 00:16:20.029
to flourish over the last 10,000 years.

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.909
So what big history can do

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:26.254
is show us the nature
of our complexity and fragility

00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:28.202
and the dangers that face us,

00:16:28.226 --> 00:16:31.806
but it can also show us
our power with collective learning.

00:16:32.586 --> 00:16:34.538
And now, finally --

00:16:35.657 --> 00:16:37.812
this is what I want.

00:16:39.448 --> 00:16:42.480
I want my grandson, Daniel,

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:45.261
and his friends and his generation,

00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:47.078
throughout the world,

00:16:47.102 --> 00:16:49.942
to know the story of big history,

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:52.005
and to know it so well

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:55.695
that they understand
both the challenges that face us

00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:58.236
and the opportunities that face us.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.140
And that's why a group of us

00:17:00.164 --> 00:17:03.176
are building a free, online syllabus

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.518
in big history

00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:06.693
for high-school students
throughout the world.

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:09.661
We believe that big history

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:12.236
will be a vital
intellectual tool for them,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.103
as Daniel and his generation

00:17:15.127 --> 00:17:17.475
face the huge challenges

00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:19.554
and also the huge opportunities

00:17:19.578 --> 00:17:23.033
ahead of them at this threshold moment

00:17:23.057 --> 00:17:26.236
in the history of our beautiful planet.

00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:28.541
I thank you for your attention.

00:17:28.565 --> 00:17:33.260
(Applause)
