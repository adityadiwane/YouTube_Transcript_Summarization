00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:15.215
I'm going to tell you the story of a song.

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:20.078
I was in Madrid one night in 2002

00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:22.405
with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.506
when he said he had something to give me.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.761
He said,

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:30.142
"Jorge, I have some lines
that you need to put into a song.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.825
Take these down, take these down."

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.853
I looked on the table but all I found
was a circular coaster,

00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:37.229
on which I wrote the lines
my teacher dictated.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.726
They were four lines that went like this:

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.087
"I am a Jewish Moor
living among Christians

00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.799
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are."

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:51.198
Those lines really made
an impression on me.

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:54.206
I said, "What beautiful lyrics,
Joaquín. Did you write them?"

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.708
He said no, they were by another composer
named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.563
who was less known than Joaquín,
but also a great poet.

00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:05.112
These lines came to me at a time

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:07.942
where I had been wanting
to express something for a while,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.606
but didn't quite know how.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.516
I was getting up to leave
and go home to write,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.030
when Joaquín stopped me
and said, "Hang on, hang on,"

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.964
and presented me with this challenge:

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.797
"Write the stanzas for this song

00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.036
in Décimas."

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.397
Now, at this point in my life,

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:28.169
I still wasn't completely
sure what Décimas were,

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:33.479
but I was too embarrassed
to tell my teacher I didn't know.

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:37.188
So I put on my best
"Yeah, I totally understand" face,

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:39.951
and went home to look up
what Décimas were.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.455
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.894
that only exists in Spanish,

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:46.182
and that it has 10 lines.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.207
It's very, very complex --

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.401
perhaps the most complex style of stanza
that we have in Spanish.

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:53.884
It also has a very concrete
date of origin,

00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:56.242
which is very rare for a style of stanza.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.921
The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:05.836
by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
a musician and poet from Málaga.

00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:09.887
And listen to this coincidence:
he was the same guy

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.434
who added the sixth string

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.761
to what would later be called
the Spanish guitar.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.151
This string right here --

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:17.468
it's called the "bordona."

00:02:18.424 --> 00:02:21.868
From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:26.699
crosses over to America,
just like the Spanish guitar,

00:02:26.723 --> 00:02:28.253
but in contrast to the Décima,

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:30.726
the Spanish guitar continues to live today

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.439
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:35.555
But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.112
disappeared; it died out.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.352
It died out about 200 years ago,

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:45.040
and yet in Latin America,
from Mexico to Chile,

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.284
all our countries maintain
some form of the Décima

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.575
in our popular traditions.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.465
In each place, they've given it
a different name,

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.020
and set it to different music.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:03:00.900
It has a lot of different names --
more than 20 in total on the continent.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.629
In Mexico, for example,
it's called the "Son Jarocho,"

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:06.458
"Canto de mejorana" in Panama;

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:08.036
"Galerón" in Venezuela;

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.960
"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:12.531
"Repentismo" in Cuba.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.837
In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.960
because the Décima becomes
so integrated into our traditions,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:21.517
that if someone asks, people
from each place are completely convinced

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.296
that the Décima was invented
in their country.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.669
(Laughter)

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:27.844
It's also got a really surprising feature,

00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:31.137
which is that despite the fact
that it developed independently

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:33.198
in each of the different countries,

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:37.600
it maintains even today,
400 years after its creation,

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:44.069
exactly the same rhyme,
syllable and line structure --

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:48.523
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
during the Spanish Baroque period.

00:03:48.547 --> 00:03:49.728
Here's the structure --

00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:52.778
I'll give you the basic idea
and then later you can look online

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:54.922
and learn more about it.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:58.011
The Décima is ten lines long;
each line has eight syllables.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.256
The first line rhymes
with the fourth and the fifth;

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.828
the second line, with the third;

00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:06.659
the sixth line,
with the seventh and the tenth;

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:09.117
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:11.928
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:14.971
And me -- imagine me,
trying to write in Décimas.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.970
But it's not as complicated as it seems.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.044
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
with the same structure

00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:23.659
for more than four centuries.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.152
It's not that complicated, because it has
an impressive musicality to it,

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:29.582
a type of musicality

00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:33.422
that's very hard to describe technically.

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.509
I prefer that you listen to it.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:38.359
So I'm going to recite a Décima,

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:42.944
one of the Décimas
that I wrote for this song.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.916
I'm going to ask that you concentrate
just on the musicality of the rhymes.

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:51.849
For those of you with headphones on --

00:04:51.873 --> 00:04:56.636
I see that some of you are listening
to the translation --

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:59.577
please take them off for a minute.

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.183
(English) Take your headphones off,
it you have them.

00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:09.245
(English) Forget about the meaning
of the words for a few seconds,

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.240
(English) and then you'll put them back.

00:05:11.264 --> 00:05:13.070
(English) Forget about the structure.

00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:14.882
(Spanish) Forget about the structure.

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:20.148
(English) And just ... it's all about
the choreography of sound of the Décima.

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:22.429
(Spanish) A choreography of sound.

00:05:24.572 --> 00:05:27.978
(Sings in Spanish) "There is not one death
that does not cause me pain,

00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:29.019
there are no winners,

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.987
here’s nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:35.388
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:38.310
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:43.211
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth."

00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.436
That's a Décima.

00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:50.278
(English) You can put
your headphones back on.

00:05:50.302 --> 00:05:51.380
(Applause)

00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:52.557
(English) Thank you.

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:55.683
(Applause)

00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:00.475
I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
because here it is 426 years later,

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.226
and the Décima lives on everywhere

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.448
in its original state.

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:06.072
I wrote three like that one;
you just heard the second.

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:08.770
I wrote the first one having only
recently learned how,

00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:10.899
and it has some errors in terms of meter,

00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:13.088
so it's not presentable
in its current state.

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:15.731
But the one I sang was good, more or less.

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:18.683
So: What was it about?

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:21.510
What was the meaning behind those lines?

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:25.057
I had just returned from doing
a concert in Israel,

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:29.710
and I was very emotional over a problem
that hits really close to home,

00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:31.801
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:33.948
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,

00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:36.845
and my mom's family
are non-practicing Christians.

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.428
I was raised in a home
where the two traditions lived together

00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:43.164
more or less in harmony.

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:48.395
It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa
dressed as Santa Claus, for example,

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.657
or to see my non-Jewish grandpa
at the synagogue wearing his kippah,

00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.096
at family celebrations, wearing the same
expression that I probably had

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.483
when Sabina told me --

00:06:56.507 --> 00:06:57.547
(Laughter)

00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:59.633
that he had some Décima lines for me.

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:05.617
For someone raised
in that kind of environment,

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:10.852
it's especially painful to see
the difficulty the opposing parties have

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:14.063
in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:15.637
So that's what I wrote about.

00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:17.473
I already had the lyrics,

00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:19.946
I had the form -- the Décima --
and the content.

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:22.806
I needed to write the music.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.390
I'll give you some context.

00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:29.233
I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
where I'm from, to Spain.

00:07:30.113 --> 00:07:32.935
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:35.739
like many of you here,
who are away from home.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.360
And I wanted my song
to be very, very Uruguayan,

00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:43.173
the most Uruguayan type of song
there is -- the milonga.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.273
So now, I had been studying the Décima,
and after finding out

00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:52.203
that everyone tried to claim
the Décima as their own,

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:54.095
that it was invented in their country,

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:55.273
it made me wonder:

00:07:55.297 --> 00:07:57.912
What does it mean when we say
the milonga is Uruguayan?

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:03.553
The milonga has a rhythmic pattern
that we musicians call 3-3-2.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.439
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:14.239
And it has a characteristic emphasis.

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:17.135
(Sings)

00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:25.475
But this characteristic rhythm pattern

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:26.930
comes from Africa.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.510
In the ninth century you could find it
in the brothels of Persia,

00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:31.693
and in the thirteenth,

00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:35.813
in Spain, from where,
five centuries later,

00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:38.488
it would cross over to America
with the African slaves.

00:08:39.697 --> 00:08:44.074
Meanwhile, in the Balkans,
it encounters the Roma scale --

00:08:44.098 --> 00:08:46.957
(Sings)

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:54.147
which in part, gives birth
to klezmer music,

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:59.022
which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants
bring to Brooklyn, New York.

00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:01.480
They sing it in their banquet halls.

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:08.152
(Sings "Hava Nagila")

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:12.231
And their neighbor,
an Argentine kid of Italian origin

00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:14.521
named Astor Piazzolla,

00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:16.563
hears it,

00:09:16.587 --> 00:09:18.114
assimilates it

00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:21.139
and transforms the tango
of the second half of the 20th century

00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:22.316
with his ...

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.443
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:28.768
(Sings "Adios Nonino")

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:38.625
He also played it on his bandoneon,
a 19th-century German instrument

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:42.776
created for churches
that couldn't afford to buy organs,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.167
and that ends up, incredibly,
in Río de la Plata,

00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:49.278
forming the very essence
of the tango and the milonga,

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:53.268
in the very same way another instrument
just as important as the bandoneon did:

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:55.896
the Spanish guitar.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.032
(Applause)

00:10:08.277 --> 00:10:11.101
To which, by the way,
Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:12.377
added a sixth string.

00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:15.271
It's amazing how all these things
are coming full circle.

00:10:15.295 --> 00:10:18.175
What have I learned in these 15 years
since the song was born

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:21.535
from going all over the world
with four lines written on a coaster

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.709
from a bar in Madrid?

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:25.664
That Décimas,

00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:27.751
the milonga,

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.341
songs, people --

00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:32.234
the closer you get to them,

00:10:32.258 --> 00:10:34.758
the more complex their identity becomes,

00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:37.480
and the more nuances and details appear.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.787
I learned that identity
is infinitely dense,

00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:44.363
like an infinite series of real numbers,

00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:46.135
and that even if you get very close

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.317
and zoom in,

00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.492
it never ends.

00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:54.860
Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,

00:10:54.884 --> 00:10:57.158
allow me to tell you one last story.

00:10:57.182 --> 00:11:01.782
Not long ago, we were in Mexico
after a concert.

00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:04.983
And since the concert promoters know me,

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:08.931
they knew I was a Décima freak
and that everywhere I go I ask about it,

00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.693
insisting on hearing Décima artists.

00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:15.407
So they organized a son jarocho show
for me at their house.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:20.531
If you recall, the son jarocho
is one of the styles of music

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.647
that uses Décimas in its verses.

00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:28.184
When these amazing musicians
finished playing

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:31.086
what is for me, something amazing,
which is the son jarocho,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.775
they finished playing and were ...

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:35.018
I went up to greet them, really excited,

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:39.286
getting ready to thank them
for their gift of music,

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.539
and this young kid says to me --

00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:46.133
and he says it with the best
of intentions -- he says,

00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:53.121
"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping
alive the purest origins

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.403
of our Mexican identity."

00:11:56.238 --> 00:11:59.154
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't really know what to say.

00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:00.207
(Laughter)

00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:03.396
I stood there looking at him.
I gave him a hug and left, but ...

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.686
(Laughter)

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.695
But he was right, too, though. Right?

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:09.550
In reality, the Décima is its origin,
but at the same time,

00:12:09.574 --> 00:12:11.944
just like in the milonga
and in the Décima,

00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:15.915
are the roots of many more cultures
from all over the place, like he said.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:21.510
Later, when I got back to the hotel,
I thought about it for a while.

00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:22.700
And I thought:

00:12:22.724 --> 00:12:25.628
things only look pure

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.088
if you look at them from far away.

00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:33.206
It's very important
to know about our roots,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.252
to know where we come from,
to understand our history.

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:40.274
But at the same time, as important
as knowing where we're from,

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:43.874
is understanding that deep down,

00:12:43.898 --> 00:12:45.858
we're all from nowhere

00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:47.507
and a little bit from everywhere.

00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:48.756
Thank you very much.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.908
(Applause)

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.241
This is "The milonga of the Jewish Moor."

00:13:01.998 --> 00:13:05.282
(Music)

00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:16.457
(Sings)

00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.668
For every wall a lament
in Jerusalem the golden

00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:29.883
and 100 wasted lives
for every commandment.

00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:37.066
I am dust in your wind
and although I bleed through your wound,

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:44.533
and every beloved stone
has my deepest affection,

00:13:45.568 --> 00:13:51.864
there is not a stone in the world
worth more than a human life.

00:13:54.311 --> 00:14:01.247
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:08.518
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:16.302
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:25.010
There is not one death that does not
cause me pain, there are no winners

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.862
there's nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:40.130
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:47.214
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:14:48.351 --> 00:14:55.248
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth.

00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:03.781
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:15:04.162 --> 00:15:10.902
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:18.507
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:30.679
And nobody has my permission
for killing in my name,

00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:39.122
a man is but a man
and if there is a God, this was his wish,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.294
the very ground I tread
will live on, once I am gone

00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:53.461
on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines
will suffer the same fate,

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:58.943
and there is not one nation
that has not proclaimed itself

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:01.938
the chosen people.

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:10.602
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:17.587
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:18.872 --> 00:16:24.699
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:24.723 --> 00:16:31.123
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:16:31.904 --> 00:16:33.304
(Applause)

00:16:33.328 --> 00:16:34.494
Thank you.

00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:38.831
(Applause)
