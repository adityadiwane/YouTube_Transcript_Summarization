00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.243
Today I have just one request.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:22.633
Please don't tell me I'm normal.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:27.009
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.275
Remi is 22,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:32.239
tall and very handsome.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.167
He's speechless, but he communicates joy

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:40.450
in a way that some of the best orators cannot.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.093
Remi knows what love is.

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:47.475
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.995
He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.

00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:54.316
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:57.571
He has never told a lie.

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.052
When he sings songs from our childhood,

00:01:00.052 --> 00:01:02.915
attempting words that not even I could remember,

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:05.139
he reminds me of one thing:

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.692
how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:11.267
the unknown must be.

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:17.004
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.788
He has the most impeccable memory.

00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:23.336
He has a selective one, though.

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:27.104
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:30.394
but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:32.793
conversations we had when he was four,

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:36.264
weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:39.672
and Lady Gaga's birthday.

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:42.409
Don't they sound incredible?

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.433
But most people don't agree.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.169
And in fact, because their minds don't fit

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:50.905
into society's version of normal,

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.843
they're often bypassed and misunderstood.

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:57.609
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.929
was that even though this was the case,

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.843
although they were not seen as ordinary,

00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:05.355
this could only mean one thing:

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:08.730
that they were extraordinary --

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.953
autistic and extraordinary.

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:17.404
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:21.306
it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:24.994
learning and sometimes physical skills.

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:27.809
It manifests in each individual differently,

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.490
hence why Remi is so different from Sam.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.124
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:35.994
is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:39.137
the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,

00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:42.313
there is no known cause or cure.

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:45.578
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:48.657
but I cannot recall a day without it.

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:51.042
I was just three years old when my brother came along,

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.306
and I was so excited that

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.409
I had a new being in my life.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.138
And after a few months went by,

00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.523
I realized that he was different.

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:03.729
He screamed a lot.

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.816
He didn't want to play like the other babies did,

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.762
and in fact, he didn't seem

00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:11.647
very interested in me whatsoever.

00:03:11.647 --> 00:03:15.627
Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:17.833
and he found pleasure in the smallest things,

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.356
like lining up cars around the room

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:22.033
and staring at the washing machine

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:25.415
and eating anything that came in between.

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:29.160
And as he grew older, he grew more different,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.843
and the differences became more obvious.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:35.295
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.064
and the never-ending hyperactivity

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:40.656
was something really unique:

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:44.624
a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:50.255
without prejudice, a human who had never lied.

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:53.336
Extraordinary.

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:55.123
Now, I cannot deny that there have been

00:03:55.123 --> 00:03:57.855
some challenging moments in my family,

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:00.968
moments where I've wished that they were just like me.

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:03.752
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me

00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:07.592
about individuality and communication and love,

00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:10.929
and I realize that these are things that

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:15.327
I wouldn't want to change with normality.

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:20.480
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.809
and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.647
It just means that there's a different kind of right.

00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:31.464
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi

00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:33.790
and to Sam

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.517
and to you,

00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:39.313
it would be that you don't have to be normal.

00:04:39.313 --> 00:04:43.296
You can be extraordinary.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:45.377
Because autistic or not,

00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:47.587
the differences that we have --

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:51.955
We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:55.419
and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.416
is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.

00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:02.756
The chance for greatness, for progress and for change

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:06.635
dies the moment we try to be like someone else.

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:09.867
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.340
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.053
(Applause)
