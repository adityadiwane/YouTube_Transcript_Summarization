00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.476
Since 2009, the world has been stuck

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.636
on a single narrative
around a coming global food crisis

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.100
and what we need to do to avoid it.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.220
How do we feed
nine billion people by 2050?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.876
Every conference, podcast
and dialogue around global food security

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.596
starts with this question

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.356
and goes on to answer it

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.820
by saying we need to produce
70 percent more food.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.796
The 2050 narrative started to evolve

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.700
shortly after global food prices
hit all-time highs in 2008.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.036
People were suffering and struggling,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.596
governments and world leaders

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.236
needed to show us
that they were paying attention

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.860
and were working to solve it.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.356
The thing is, 2050
is so far into the future

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380
that we can't even relate to it,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.836
and more importantly,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.116
if we keep doing what we're doing,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.500
it's going to hit us
a lot sooner than that.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.180
I believe we need to ask
a different question.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.436
The answer to that question

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.020
needs to be framed differently.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.676
If we can reframe the old narrative

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.156
and replace it with new numbers

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.260
that tell us a more complete pictures,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.716
numbers that everyone can understand

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.940
and relate to,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.820
we can avoid the crisis altogether.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.236
I was a commodities trader in my past life

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.436
and one of the things
that I learned trading

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
is that every market has a tipping point,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.756
the point at which
change occurs so rapidly

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.636
that it impacts the world

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.620
and things change forever.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.500
Think of the last financial crisis,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.300
or the dot-com crash.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.060
So here's my concern.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.636
We could have a tipping point

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.796
in global food and agriculture

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.715
if surging demand

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.140
surpasses the agricultural system's
structural capacity to produce food.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.796
This means at this point supply
can no longer keep up with demand

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.076
despite exploding prices,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
unless we can commit
to some type of structural change.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.156
This time around,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.756
it won't be about stock markets and money.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.156
It's about people.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.580
People could starve
and governments may fall.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.556
This question of at what point
does supply struggle

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.236
to keep up with surging demand

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.916
is one that started off as an interest
for me while I was trading

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.716
and became an absolute obsession.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.676
It went from interest to obsession

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.356
when I realized through my research
how broken the system was

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.700
and how very little data was being used
to make such critical decisions.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.716
That's the point I decided to walk away
from a career on Wall Street

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.236
and start an entrepreneurial journey

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.220
to start Gro Intelligence.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.196
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.476
and doing the work to make it actionable,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
to empower decision-makers at every level.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.316
But doing this work,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.596
we also realized that the world,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.276
not just world leaders,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.556
but businesses and citizens
like every single person in this room,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.660
lacked an actionable guide

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.196
on how we can avoid
a coming global food security crisis.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.236
And so we built a model,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.156
leveraging the petabytes
of data we sit on,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.580
and we solved for the tipping point.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.996
Now, no one knows
we've been working on this problem

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.620
and this is the first time
that I'm sharing what we discovered.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.660
We discovered that the tipping point
is actually a decade from now.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.436
We discovered that the world

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.820
will be short 214 trillion calories

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.219
by 2027.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.060
The world is not in a position
to fill this gap.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.820
Now, you'll notice

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.076
that the way I'm framing this
is different from how I started,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.236
and that's intentional, because until now

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.476
this problem has been
quantified using mass:

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.316
think kilograms, tons, hectograms,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.420
whatever your unit of choice is in mass.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.700
Why do we talk about food
in terms of weight?

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.596
Because it's easy.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.116
We can look at a photograph
and determine tonnage on a ship

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.396
by using a simple pocket calculator.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.180
We can weigh trucks,
airplanes and oxcarts.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.740
But what we care about
in food is nutritional value.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.996
Not all foods are created equal,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.780
even if they weigh the same.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.196
This I learned firsthand

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.220
when I moved from Ethiopia
to the US for university.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.156
Upon my return back home,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.396
my father, who was so excited to see me,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.020
greeted me by asking why I was fat.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.556
Now, turns out that eating

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.436
approximately the same amount of food
as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.700
had actually lent
a certain fullness to my figure.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.676
This is why we should care about calories,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.356
not about mass.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.140
It is calories which sustain us.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.516
So 214 trillion calories
is a very large number,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.676
and not even the most dedicated of us

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.636
think in the hundreds
of trillions of calories.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.780
So let me break this down differently.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.036
An alternative way to think about this

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.916
is to think about it in Big Macs.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.556
214 trillion calories.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.796
A single Big Mac has 563 calories.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.036
That means the world will be short
379 billion Big Macs in 2027.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.060
That is more Big Macs
than McDonald's has ever produced.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.836
So how did we get
to these numbers in the first place?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.060
They're not made up.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.036
This map shows you
where the world was 40 years ago.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.076
It shows you net calorie gaps
in every country in the world.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.556
Now, simply put,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.596
this is just calories
consumed in that country

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.676
minus calories produced
in that same country.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.476
This is not a statement
on malnutrition or anything else.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.516
It's simply saying how many calories
are consumed in a single year

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.396
minus how many are produced.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.796
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.196
or self-sufficient.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.260
They have some in storage for a rainy day.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.716
Red countries are net calorie importers.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.676
The deeper, the brighter the red,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.940
the more you're importing.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.476
40 years ago, such few countries
were net exporters of calories,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.072
I could count them with one hand.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.276
Most of the African continent,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.916
Europe, most of Asia,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.956
South America excluding Argentina,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.700
were all net importers of calories.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.000
And what's surprising is that China
used to actually be food self-sufficient.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.460
India was a big net importer of calories.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.260
40 years later, this is today.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.260
You can see the drastic transformation
that's occurred in the world.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.356
Brazil has emerged
as an agricultural powerhouse.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.636
Europe is dominant in global agriculture.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.636
India has actually flipped
from red to blue.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.916
It's become food self-sufficient.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.396
And China went from that light blue

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.060
to the brightest red
that you see on this map.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.460
How did we get here? What happened?

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.620
So this chart shows you India and Africa.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.580
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.396
How is it that two regions
that started off so similarly

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.556
in such similar trajectories

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.716
take such different paths?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.780
India had a green revolution.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.916
Not a single African country
had a green revolution.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.156
The net outcome?

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.876
India is food self-sufficient

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.276
and in the past decade
has actually been exporting calories.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.260
The African continent now imports
over 300 trillion calories a year.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.396
Then we add China, the green line.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.100
Remember the switch
from the blue to the bright red?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.996
What happened and when did it happen?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.876
China seemed to be
on a very similar path to India

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.676
until the start of the 21st century,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.380
where it suddenly flipped.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.236
A young and growing population

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.356
combined with significant economic growth

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.796
made its mark with a big bang

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.300
and no one in the markets saw it coming.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.076
This flip was everything
to global agricultural markets.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.916
Luckily now, South America

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.156
was starting to boom
at the same time as China's rise,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.180
and so therefore, supply and demand
were still somewhat balanced.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.540
So the question becomes,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.060
where do we go from here?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.156
Oddly enough,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.380
it's not a new story,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.996
except this time
it's not just a story of China.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.396
It's a continuation of China,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.516
an amplification of Africa

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.500
and a paradigm shift in India.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.940
By 2023,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.876
Africa's population is forecasted
to overtake that of India's and China's.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.556
By 2023, these three regions combined

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.740
will make up over half
the world's population.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.236
This crossover point starts to present
really interesting challenges

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.996
for global food security.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.420
And a few years later,
we're hit hard with that reality.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.300
What does the world look like in 10 years?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.836
So far, as I mentioned,
India has been food self-sufficient.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.260
Most forecasters predict
that this will continue.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.220
We disagree.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.116
India will soon become
a net importer of calories.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.396
This will be driven both by the fact

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.916
that demand is growing
from a population growth standpoint

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.196
plus economic growth.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.476
It will be driven by both.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.196
And even if you have
optimistic assumptions

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.116
around production growth,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.260
it will make that slight flip.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.700
That slight flip
can have huge implications.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.156
Next, Africa will continue
to be a net importer of calories,

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.180
again driven by population growth
and economic growth.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.836
This is again assuming optimistic
production growth assumptions.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.276
Then China,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.876
where population is flattening out,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.876
calorie consumption will explode

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.916
because the types of calories consumed

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.460
are also starting to be
higher-calorie-content foods.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.156
And so therefore,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.036
these three regions combined

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.356
start to present a really interesting
challenge for the world.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.476
Until now, countries with calorie deficits

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.076
have been able to meet these deficits

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.940
by importing from surplus regions.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.356
By surplus regions, I'm talking about

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.516
North America, South America and Europe.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.956
This line chart over here shows you

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.276
the growth and the projected growth
over the next decade of production

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.596
from North America,
South America and Europe.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.036
What it doesn't show you

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.500
is that most of this growth is actually
going to come from South America.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.876
And most of this growth

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.300
is going to come
at the huge cost of deforestation.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.836
And so when you look
at the combined demand increase

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.180
coming from India, China
and the African continent,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.836
and look at it versus
the combined increase in production

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.636
coming from India,
China, the African continent,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.020
North America, South America and Europe,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.516
you are left with
a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.276
one we can't produce.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.236
And this, by the way, is actually assuming
we take all the extra calories

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.641
produced in North America,
South America and Europe

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.940
and export them solely
to India, China and Africa.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.500
What I just presented to you
is a vision of an impossible world.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.180
We can do something to change that.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.516
We can change consumption patterns,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.796
we can reduce food waste,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.036
or we can make a bold commitment

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.380
to increasing yields exponentially.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.676
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.196
changing consumption patterns
or reducing food waste,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.276
because those conversations
have been going on for some time now.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.516
Nothing has happened.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.996
Nothing has happened
because those arguments

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.956
ask the surplus regions
to change their behavior

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.420
on behalf of deficit regions.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.276
Waiting for others
to change their behavior

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.796
on your behalf, for your survival,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.316
is a terrible idea.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.940
It's unproductive.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.100
So I'd like to suggest an alternative
that comes from the red regions.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.156
China, India, Africa.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.476
China is constrained in terms
of how much more land it actually has

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.036
available for agriculture,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.836
and it has massive
water resource availability issues.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.500
So the answer really lies
in India and in Africa.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.596
India has some upside
in terms of potential yield increases.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.196
Now this is the gap
between its current yield

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.340
and the theoretical
maximum yield it can achieve.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.756
It has some unfarmed
arable land remaining, but not much,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.060
India is quite land-constrained.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.716
Now, the African continent,
on the other hand,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.036
has vast amounts of arable land remaining

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.740
and significant
upside potential in yields.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.996
Somewhat simplified picture here,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.036
but if you look at sub-Saharan
African yields in corn today,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.540
they are where North American
yields were in 1940.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.156
We don't have 70-plus years
to figure this out,

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.716
so it means we need to try something new

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.900
and we need to try something different.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.380
The solution starts with reforms.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.676
We need to reform and commercialize

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.236
the agricultural industries in Africa

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.460
and in India.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.276
Now, by commercialization --

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.436
commercialization is not
about commercial farming alone.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.036
Commercialization is about leveraging data

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.356
to craft better policies,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.996
to improve infrastructure,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.876
to lower the transportation costs

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.156
and to completely reform
banking and insurance industries.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.276
Commercialization
is about taking agriculture

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.396
from too risky an endeavor
to one where fortunes can be made.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.676
Commercialization
is not about just farmers.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.980
Commercialization is about
the entire agricultural system.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.716
But commercialization
also means confronting the fact

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.156
that we can no longer place
the burden of growth

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.300
on small-scale farmers alone,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.676
and accepting that commercial farms
and the introduction of commercial farms

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.396
could provide certain economies of scale

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.660
that even small-scale
farmers can leverage.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.836
It is not about small-scale farming
or commercial agriculture,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.716
or big agriculture.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.996
We can create the first successful models
of the coexistence and success

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.796
of small-scale farming
alongside commercial agriculture.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.836
This is because, for the first time ever,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.596
the most critical tool
for success in the industry --

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.116
data and knowledge --

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.380
is becoming cheaper by the day.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.956
And very soon, it won't matter
how much money you have

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.436
or how big you are

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.756
to make optimal decisions
and maximize probability of success

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.260
in reaching your intended goal.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.740
Companies like Gro are working
really hard to make this a reality.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.996
So if we can commit
to this new, bold initiative,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.036
to this new, bold change,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:55.476
not only can we solve
the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.100
but we can actually set the world
on a whole new path.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.876
India can remain food self-sufficient

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.660
and Africa can emerge
as the world's next dark blue region.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.276
The new question is,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.436
how do we produce 214 trillion calories

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.620
to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.060
We have the solution.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.580
We just need to act on it.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.556
Thank you.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.939
(Applause)
