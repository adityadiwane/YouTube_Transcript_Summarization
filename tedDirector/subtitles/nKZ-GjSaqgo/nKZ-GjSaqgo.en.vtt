00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
about the human genome and what that might mean,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and discovering new sets of genes.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
We're actually starting at a new point:

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
we've been digitizing biology,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
and now we're trying to go from that digital code

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
into a new phase of biology

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
with designing and synthesizing life.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
have been trying to understand

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
at various levels.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
We've tried various approaches,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
paring it down to minimal components.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
when we sequenced the human genome,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
it was going from the analog world of biology

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.330
into the digital world of the computer.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
or can we create new life

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
out of this digital universe?"

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
This is the map of a small organism,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
Mycoplasma genitalium,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
that has the smallest genome for a species

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
that can self-replicate in the laboratory,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
and we've been trying to just see if

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
we can come up with an even smaller genome.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
out of the 500 or so that are here.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
When we look at its metabolic map,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
it's relatively simple

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
compared to ours --

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
trust me, this is simple --

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
but when we look at all the genes

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
that we can knock out one at a time,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
it's very unlikely that this would yield

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
a living cell.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
So we decided the only way forward

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
was to actually synthesize this chromosome

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
so we could vary the components

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
to ask some of these most fundamental questions.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
And so we started down the road of:

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
can we synthesize a chromosome?

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Can chemistry permit making

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
these really large molecules

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
where we've never been before?

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
at an exponential pace.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Our ability to write the genetic code

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
has been moving pretty slowly

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
but has been increasing,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
We started this over 15 years ago.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
It took several stages, in fact,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
But it turns out synthesizing DNA

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
is very difficult.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
that make small pieces of DNA --

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
30 to 50 letters in length --

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
the more errors there are.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
So we had to create a new method

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
of the genome of phi X174.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
We designed the pieces, went through our error correction

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and had a DNA molecule

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
of about 5,000 letters.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.330
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
and put it in the bacteria,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
made the viral particles.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
The viral particles then were released from the cells

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and came back and killed the E. coli.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
I was talking to the oil industry recently

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
and I said they clearly understood that model.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
(Laughter)

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And so, we think this is a situation

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
where the software can actually build its own hardware

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
in a biological system.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
But we wanted to go much larger:

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
so we could actually vary the cassettes

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
to understand

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
what the actual components of a living cell are.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
Design is critical,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.330
that digital information has to be really accurate.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
We actually found, on resequencing it,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
30 errors; had we used that original sequence,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
it never would have been able to be booted up.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Part of the design is designing pieces

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
that are 50 letters long

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
to build smaller subunits

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
we have to design so they can go together.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
We design unique elements into this.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
You may have read that we put watermarks in.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
Think of this:

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Triplets of those letters

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
code for roughly 20 amino acids,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
such that there's a single letter designation

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
for each of the amino acids.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
So we can use the genetic code to write out words,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
sentences, thoughts.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
Initially, all we did was autograph it.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
We designed these pieces so

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
we can just chew back with enzymes;

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
And we started making pieces,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.330
put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
so we could sequence them

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
that you can see in a minute.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
We're trying to get to the point of automation.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
So, this looks like a basketball playoff.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
When we get into these really large pieces

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
over 100,000 base pairs,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.330
it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.330
and so we turned to other mechanisms.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
that biology uses to repair DNA

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
that can put pieces together.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Here's an example of it:

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.330
there's an organism called

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
that can take three millions rads of radiation.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
back together exactly as it was before.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
These organisms can be totally desiccated;

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
they can live in a vacuum.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
move around, find a new aqueous environment.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
with the right design of the pieces we put them in;

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
yeast puts them together automatically.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
This is not an electron micrograph;

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
this is just a regular photomicrograph.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
It's such a large molecule

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
we can see it with a light microscope.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
These are pictures over about a six-second period.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.330
it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
It's over 300 million molecular weight.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
it takes 142 pages

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
just to print this genetic code.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
It's also simpler when you go

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
into eukaryotes like ourselves:

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
you can just pop out the nucleus

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
and pop in another one,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
of a chromosome from one cell to another

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
and activate it.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
we added a few extra genes

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
so we could select for this chromosome,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
we digested it with enzymes

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
to kill all the proteins,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
and you'll appreciate

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
our very sophisticated graphics here.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
The new chromosome went into the cell.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
We find all kinds of species

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
that have taken up a second chromosome

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
or a third one from somewhere,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
adding thousands of new traits

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
in a second to that species.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
So, people who think of evolution

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
as just one gene changing at a time

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
have missed much of biology.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
that actually digest DNA.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
The chromosome that was in the cell

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
doesn't have one;

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
the chromosome we put in does.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
It got expressed and it recognized

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
the other chromosome as foreign material,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
chewed it up, and so we ended up

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
just with a cell with the new chromosome.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And with a very short period of time,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
all the characteristics of one species were lost

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
and it converted totally into the new species

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
based on the new software that we put in the cell.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
All the proteins changed,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
the membranes changed;

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
change things quite dramatically.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Now I've argued, this is not genesis;

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
where there's massive new speciation

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
based on this digital design.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Why do this?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
We're about to go from six and a half

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
to nine billion people over the next 40 years.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
To put it in context for myself:

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
I was born in 1946.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
There are now three people on the planet

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.330
for every one of us that existed in 1946;

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
within 40 years, there'll be four.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
medicines, fuel

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
for the six and a half billion.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
We use over five billion tons of coal,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
30 billion-plus barrels of oil --

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.330
that's a hundred million barrels a day.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
When we try to think of biological processes

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
or any process to replace that,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
it's going to be a huge challenge.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
Then of course, there's all that

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
CO2 from this material

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
that ends up in the atmosphere.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
We now, from our discovery around the world,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
have a database with about 20 million genes,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and look at the diversity that came out of that.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
We're limited here primarily

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
by a biological reality

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
and our imagination.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
We now have techniques,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
because of these rapid methods of synthesis,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.330
to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
We have the ability now to build a large robot

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
that can make a million chromosomes a day.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
or trying to optimize processes

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
new vaccines,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
we can just with a small team,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
do more molecular biology

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
than the last 20 years of all science.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
And it's just standard selection:

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
we can select for viability,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
chemical or fuel production,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
vaccine production, etc.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
This is a screen snapshot

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
of some true design software

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
that we're working on to actually be able to sit down

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
and design species in the computer.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.330
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
You've seen recently, corn to ethanol

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
is just a bad experiment.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
We have second- and third-generation fuels

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
that will be coming out relatively soon

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
like octane or different types of butanol.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
But the only way we think that biology

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
can have a major impact without

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.330
and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
in about 18 months.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.330
(Applause)

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
but in our discovery around the world,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
we have all kinds of other methods.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.330
This is an organism we described in 1996.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
It lives in the deep ocean,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
about a mile and a half deep,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
almost at boiling-water temperatures.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
It takes CO2 to methane

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
We're looking to see if we can take

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
captured CO2,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
which can easily be piped to sites,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
convert that CO2 back into fuel

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
to drive this process.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
So, in a short period of time,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.330
we think that we might be able to increase

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
what the basic question is of "What is life?"

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
We truly, you know,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
have modest goals

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry --

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? --

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
(Laughter)

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
become a major source of energy ...

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
But also, we're now working on using these same tools

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
to come up with instant sets of vaccines.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
You've seen this year with flu;

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
we're always a year behind and a dollar short

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
when it comes to the right vaccine.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
I think that can be changed

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
Here's what the future may begin to look like

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
speeding up evolution

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
with synthetic bacteria, Archaea

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
and, eventually, eukaryotes.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
We're a ways away from improving people:

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:47.330
(Applause)
