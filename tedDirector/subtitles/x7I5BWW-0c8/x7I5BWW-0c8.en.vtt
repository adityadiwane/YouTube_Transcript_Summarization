00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:16.273
It was the end of October
in the mountains in Austria.

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.698
I was there on a field trip
with my architecture students from Zurich.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.846
And when we reached a high valley,

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.088
I surprised them with the news
that there was no hut

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:29.730
or hotel booked for the night.

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.039
It was not a mistake.

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:34.951
It was totally on purpose.

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:40.730
The challenge was to build our own shelter
with whatever we could find.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:43.874
And we all survived.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.191
It was cold, it was really tough ...

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:49.525
and it was a great learning experience

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.359
to discover that there are a lot
of resources given by nature for free,

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:57.200
and all that we need
is our sensitivity to see them ...

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.030
and our creativity to use them.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.237
I found myself in a similar situation.

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:10.746
When I was an architecture student
about 13 years ago,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.059
I went to Bangladesh
to a remote village called Rudrapur

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.448
with the aim to design and build
a school as my thesis project.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:21.203
I had lived in that village before
when I was 19 and a volunteer

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:24.164
at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO
for rural development.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:25.870
And what I had learned from them

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:30.672
was that the most sustainable strategy
for sustainable development

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:35.855
is to cherish and to use
your very own resources and potential,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.308
and not get dependent on external factors.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.188
And this is what I tried to do
with my architecture as well.

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.560
In terms of suitable building
materials for my school,

00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:48.012
I didn't have to look far.

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.393
They were right under my feet:

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:55.407
mud, earth, dirt, clay,
however you call it ...

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:58.941
and bamboo that was growing all around.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.355
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:06.585
but we didn't need it.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.208
We had human energy

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:10.430
and the people were happy
to have the work.

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:13.947
Tools were an issue, too,

00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:15.534
but we had these guys,

00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:16.986
water buffalos.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.686
We had also tried a bit cows,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.289
but interestingly,
they were too intelligent.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.726
They were always stepping
in the holes of the previous round.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.608
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --

00:02:28.632 --> 00:02:29.682
(Laughter)

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:32.341
the sand, which are
the ingredients in the walls.

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.365
And except a small team of consultants

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.492
like my partner
for realization, Eike Roswag,

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:41.134
and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:45.516
it was all built by craftsmen
from the village.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.717
And this is the METI school
after six months of construction.

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:53.084
(Applause)

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:54.267
Thank you.

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.893
(Applause)

00:02:55.917 --> 00:03:00.022
Load-bearing earth walls
that really ground the school,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.640
and large bamboo structures
that bring the lightness in.

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.876
That's the classroom on the ground floor.

00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:10.662
Attached to it are the caves.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.997
They're for reading,
for snuggling, for solo work,

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.663
for meditation, for playing ...

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.464
and the classroom on the top.

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:25.434
The children all signed
with their names in Bengali the doors,

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:28.799
and they did not only sign,
they also helped building the school.

00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:32.929
And I'm sure you all had your hands
in mud or clay before.

00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:34.766
It's wonderful to touch. I love it.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.130
The children loved it.

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:41.569
And can you imagine the feeling
of a small boy or a girl

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:45.522
or an illiterate day laborer standing
in front of that school building

00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:47.087
and knowing that you built this

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.705
out of the ordinary bamboo
and just the dirt underneath your feet,

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.375
using nothing but your hands?

00:03:55.381 --> 00:04:01.058
That gives such an enormous boost
of trust and confidence

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:03.098
in yourself and the community.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.114
And in the material.

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:10.037
Especially mud has a very poor image.

00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.165
When we think of mud, we think of dirt --

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.403
it's ugly, it's nondurable --

00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:17.958
and this is the image I want to change.

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.726
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season
for this school now,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.004
really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,

00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:28.575
and the walls are standing strong.

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.460
(Applause)

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:34.826
So how does it work?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.006
First rule, a good foundation
that keeps the wall dry from the ground,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.726
and second rule, a good roof
that protects from the top,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.260
and third rule, erosion control.

00:04:46.013 --> 00:04:48.299
Mud walls need speed breakers

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:52.531
so that the rainwater
cannot run down the wall fast,

00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:55.837
and these speed breakers
could be lines of bamboo

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.442
or stones or straw mixed into the mud,

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:04.727
just like a hill needs trees or rocks
in order to prevent erosion.

00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.124
It works just the same way.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.193
And people always ask me
if I have to add cement to the mud,

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:12.692
and the answer is no.

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:16.870
There is no stabilizer,
no coating on these walls,

00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:18.218
only in the foundation.

00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:21.932
So this is the close-up of the wall

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:25.416
after 10 rainy seasons,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.880
and as much as I grew a bit older,

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:29.626
the wall got some wrinkles as well.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.817
The edges my not be as sharp as before,

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.993
but it still looks pretty good,

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:35.747
and if it needs repairing,

00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.762
it is really easy to do.

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:39.529
You just take the broken part,

00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:42.291
make it wet, and put it back on the wall,

00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:44.338
and it will look the same as before.

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:45.905
Wish that would work on me, too.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:49.230
(Laughter)

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.661
Yeah, and the great thing is,

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.106
if an earth wall is not needed anymore,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.371
it can go back to the ground it came from,

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:00.303
turn into a garden,

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.850
or get fully recycled
without any loss of quality.

00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:06.518
There's no other material
that can do this,

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:10.867
and this is why mud is so excellent
in terms of environmental performance.

00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:14.376
What about the economic sustainability?

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:16.338
When we built the school,

00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:18.739
I practically lived
on the construction site,

00:06:18.763 --> 00:06:21.787
and in the evening, I used to go
with the workers to the market,

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:23.887
and I could see
how they spent their money.

00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:28.104
And they would buy
the vegetables from their neighbors,

00:06:28.128 --> 00:06:31.413
they would get a new haircut
or a new blouse from the tailor.

00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:36.536
And because the main part
of the building budget

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.705
was spent on craftsmanship,

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.161
the school wasn't just a building,

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:45.349
it became a real catalyst
for local development,

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:46.873
and that made me happy.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.207
If I had designed the school
in cement and steel,

00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:54.834
this money would have been exported
and lost for those families.

00:06:56.334 --> 00:07:00.508
(Applause)

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:05.326
The building budget at that time
was 35,000 euros --

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.311
it's probably doubled by now --

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:10.423
and this is a lot of money
for that region,

00:07:10.447 --> 00:07:14.452
and especially because this money
is working within the community

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:15.754
and rotating fast,

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.460
and not on the stock market.

00:07:18.222 --> 00:07:23.079
So when it comes to the economic
sustainability of my project,

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:26.349
my main question is, who gets the profit?

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:30.786
How many of you in here

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.992
have some experience
living in a mud house?

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:35.371
Chris Anderson, where is your hand?

00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:36.452
(Laughter)

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:37.650
You? OK.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.110
Yeah.

00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:43.299
It seems totally out of our focus,

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:47.957
but approximately three billion people
all around the planet

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:50.464
are living in earth houses,

00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:52.774
and it is a traditional building material

00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:55.511
in Europe just as much as in Africa.

00:07:57.896 --> 00:07:59.437
Strangely enough,

00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:03.126
mud is not considered worthy
of being studied at universities ...

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.299
so I brought the dirt to Harvard,

00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:09.530
(Laughter)

00:08:09.554 --> 00:08:13.530
precisely 60 tons of dirt
right in front of the main facade

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:15.156
of the Graduate School of Design.

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:19.442
Students and faculty
rolled up their sleeves,

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:20.621
got their hands dirty

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:24.044
and transformed the front
into a warm place for people to gather.

00:08:25.068 --> 00:08:26.784
Children would climb the structures,

00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:28.325
skaters would ride the ramp,

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.095
students having lunch breaks,

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:34.191
and it was particularly fascinating to see
how many people were touching the wall,

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:38.068
and we usually don't go around cities
caressing our facades, right?

00:08:38.092 --> 00:08:39.953
(Laughter)

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.833
(Laughter)

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.430
Of course, this was a small-scale project,

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:53.550
but in terms of awareness-building
and in terms of education,

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:56.104
it was like an acupuncture trigger point.

00:08:57.521 --> 00:09:01.101
And in fact, in more and more countries,

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:06.110
load-bearing earthen structures
are not allowed to be built anymore

00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:09.636
although they're traditional
and have lasted for hundreds of years,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.676
and not because the material is weak,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.852
but because there are
no architects and engineers

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:17.312
who know how to deal with that material.

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:19.010
So education on all levels,

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:21.710
for craftsmen, engineers and architects,

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:23.501
is really strongly needed.

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:27.249
Equally important
is technological development,

00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:30.366
like prefabrication developed
by my colleague Martin Rauch,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.376
who is an Austrian artist
and expert in earthen structures.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.010
And he has created technologies
for rammed earth elements,

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:40.467
for prefabrication
of rammed earth elements

00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:44.252
that include insulation,
wall heatings and coolings

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:46.077
and all sorts of electrical fittings

00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:48.394
that can be layered
to multistoried buildings,

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:51.095
and this is important in order to scale up

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:53.087
and in order to fasten up the processes,

00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:56.411
like in the Ricola Herb Center
in Switzerland.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.503
And finally, we need good built projects

00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:04.622
that prove you can build
with an ancient material

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.514
in a very modern way.

00:10:07.254 --> 00:10:10.948
It is not a matter
of how old a material is;

00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:14.453
it's a matter of our creative
ability to use it today.

00:10:16.756 --> 00:10:19.011
These, for example, are three hostels

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.382
that I did in China in the village Baoxi,

00:10:21.406 --> 00:10:24.192
about six hours by bus from Shanghai.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:28.370
The outside shape is woven bamboo,

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.957
and the inside core
is stones and rammed earth.

00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:35.334
And it is a traditional building material.

00:10:35.358 --> 00:10:37.551
Even large parts
of the Great Wall of China

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.220
have been built with rammed earth,

00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:41.537
but it's getting replaced by concrete.

00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:45.705
And this trend is happening very fast.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.705
Within only a couple of years,

00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:51.722
China has consumed more cement
than the United States

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:53.982
in the entire 20th century.

00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:57.947
And this trend of replacing
natural building materials

00:10:57.971 --> 00:11:00.224
with materials that require
a lot of energy,

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:02.034
that are energy-intensive,

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.099
and that emit CO2

00:11:04.123 --> 00:11:07.463
is really clearly contributing
to climate change.

00:11:07.487 --> 00:11:08.900
And we have alternatives,

00:11:08.924 --> 00:11:13.175
such as mud, stones, timber,
bamboo, earth,

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:17.087
that are totally effective options
for all sorts of purposes.

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:20.293
This, for example,
is an office building that we did

00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:22.698
for Omicron Electronics in Austria.

00:11:22.722 --> 00:11:25.619
Mud is healthy for the planet,
but also for the human bodies,

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:28.285
and the material is low-tech,

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:30.532
but the performance is high-tech.

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:34.635
The earth walls keep the highly
sophisticated tools in the building safe

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:36.570
by naturally regulating moisture.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.922
And this wall in my own home

00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:42.374
is our humidfier.

00:11:44.192 --> 00:11:47.122
We love our six tons of dirt at home

00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:49.636
not only because
it's healthy and sustainable.

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:53.273
Its archaic warmth
is touching deep within.

00:11:54.528 --> 00:11:59.250
My personal dream is to build
a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.679
(Laughter)

00:12:01.703 --> 00:12:02.854
Yeah.

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:05.077
(Applause)

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.650
And this dream isn't so crazy

00:12:06.674 --> 00:12:08.866
if you think of the mud city
of Shibam in Yemen

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.755
that was built in the 16th century

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:14.047
and has lasted now for 500 years.

00:12:15.087 --> 00:12:19.194
What was possible that long ago
is possible today as well,

00:12:19.218 --> 00:12:22.822
and we can apply
all our technical know-how

00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:24.856
to these ancient materials

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.482
so that it meets our needs and our dreams.

00:12:30.223 --> 00:12:32.097
All around us,

00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:33.873
and just below our feet ...

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.647
are wonderful natural building materials.

00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:39.046
Let's use them.

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.957
And I deeply believe

00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:44.734
our homes, our work spaces, our cities

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:48.115
would become more healthy and sustainable

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.582
and more humane

00:12:51.907 --> 00:12:53.113
and beautiful.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:54.903
Thank you.

00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:59.970
(Applause)
