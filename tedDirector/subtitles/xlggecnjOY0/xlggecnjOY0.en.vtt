00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:14.082
I would like to talk to you about a story

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.563
about a small town kid.

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:20.238
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:23.314
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:27.344
His village is near Mogadishu.

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:29.518
Drought drives the small village into poverty

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:31.386
and to the brink of starvation.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:33.222
With nothing left for him there,

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:35.049
he leaves for the big city,

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.454
in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.284
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:44.272
no jobs, no way forward.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:46.296
He ends up living in a tent city

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.000
on the outskirts of Mogadishu.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.009
Maybe a year passes, nothing.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.309
One day, he's approached by a gentleman

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.507
who offers to take him to lunch,

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:00.583
then to dinner, to breakfast.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:03.602
He meets this dynamic group of people,

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:05.107
and they give him a break.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:06.426
He's given a bit of money

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:08.528
to buy himself some new clothes,

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:11.064
money to send back home to his family.

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:13.037
He is introduced to this young woman.

00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:14.752
He eventually gets married.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:17.557
He starts this new life.

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:20.483
He has a purpose in life.

00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:23.257
One beautiful day in Mogadishu,

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:26.145
under an azure blue sky,

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:28.666
a car bomb goes off.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.861
That small town kid with the big city dreams

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.109
was the suicide bomber,

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.467
and that dynamic group of people

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.836
were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.517
linked to al Qaeda.

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:45.389
So how does the story of a small town kid

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.210
just trying to make it big in the city

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.040
end up with him blowing himself up?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.012
He was waiting.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.910
He was waiting for an opportunity,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.692
waiting to begin his future,

00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:57.727
waiting for a way forward,

00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:00.106
and this was the first thing that came along.

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:02.520
This was the first thing that pulled him out

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.460
of what we call waithood.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.756
And his story repeats itself

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.172
in urban centers around the world.

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:12.926
It is the story of the disenfranchised,

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:14.734
unemployed urban youth

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:18.677
who sparks riots in Johannesburg,

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:21.011
sparks riots in London,

00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:25.665
who reaches out for something other than waithood.

00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:28.329
For young people, the promise of the city,

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.023
the big city dream is that of opportunity,

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:33.178
of jobs, of wealth,

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:36.919
but young people are not sharing
in the prosperity of their cities.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.017
Often it's youth who suffer from
the highest unemployment rates.

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:44.210
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.770
will be under the age of 18.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.534
If we do not include young people

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.353
in the growth of our cities,

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.832
if we do not provide them opportunities,

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:54.854
the story of waithood,

00:02:54.854 --> 00:02:57.767
the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:01.942
will be the story of cities 2.0.

00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:05.103
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:08.793
70 percent of young people
suffer from unemployment.

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:11.171
70 percent don't work,

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.198
don't go to school.

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:15.623
They pretty much do nothing.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:19.139
I went back to Mogadishu last month,

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.149
and I went to visit Madina Hospital,

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.197
the hospital I was born in.

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:25.222
I remember standing in front of that

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:28.200
bullet-ridden hospital thinking,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.233
what if I had never left?

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.426
What if I had been forced

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.945
into that same state of waithood?

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:37.956
Would I have become a terrorist?

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:40.847
I'm not really sure about the answer.

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:43.015
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:44.562
was actually to host

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:47.109
a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.105
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.351
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions

00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:55.227
to the biggest challenges facing their city.

00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:58.629
One of the young men in the room was Aden.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.084
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.273
There were no jobs, no opportunities.

00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:06.991
I remember him telling me,

00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.799
because he was a college graduate,

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.549
unemployed, frustrated,

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.946
that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:17.998
and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.

00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:21.876
They sought people like him out.

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:24.972
But his story takes a different route.

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:26.909
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.162
to getting from point A to point B are the roads.

00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:31.945
Twenty-three years of civil war

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:34.176
have completely destroyed the road system,

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.185
and a motorbike can be the easiest way

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.815
to get around.

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.056
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.181
He started a motorbike company.

00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.472
He began renting out motorbikes

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:48.772
to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:50.793
He bought 10 bikes, with the help

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:52.491
of family and friends,

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.224
and his dream is to eventually expand

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:57.205
to several hundred within the next three years.

00:04:57.205 --> 00:04:59.773
How is this story different?

00:04:59.773 --> 00:05:02.130
What makes his story different?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.960
I believe it is his ability to identify

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.298
and seize a new opportunity.

00:05:08.298 --> 00:05:10.329
It's entrepreneurship,

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:12.088
and I believe entrepreneurship can be

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:15.066
the most powerful tool against waithood.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:16.836
It empowers young people

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:20.216
to be the creators of the very economic opportunities

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:22.714
they are so desperately seeking.

00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:26.396
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.

00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:28.512
I want to talk to you about a young man

00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:30.801
who attended one of my meetings,

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:33.685
Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:35.368
He was helping me train some of the young people

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:36.805
at the summit in entrepreneurship

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:38.427
and how to be innovative

00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:41.194
and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.

00:05:41.194 --> 00:05:43.691
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen

00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.375
in over 22 years,

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.639
and until recently, until Mohamed came along,

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.529
if you wanted flowers at your wedding,

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.922
you used plastic bouquets

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:54.508
shipped from abroad.

00:05:54.508 --> 00:05:56.314
If you asked someone,

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.589
"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:01.175
for many who grew up under civil war,

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:03.958
the answer would be, "Never."

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.906
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:10.353
He started a landscaping and design floral company.

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:13.661
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:15.717
and started growing tulips and lilies,

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:17.423
which he said could survive

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:20.134
the harsh Mogadishu climate.

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:23.832
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:25.765
creating gardens at homes

00:06:25.765 --> 00:06:28.369
and businesses around the city,

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.106
and he's now working on creating

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.731
Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.

00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:35.830
There's no public park in Mogadishu.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.159
He wants to create a space where families,

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.810
young people, can come together,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.448
and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.

00:06:44.448 --> 00:06:46.404
And he doesn't grow roses because

00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:50.528
they use too much water, by the way.

00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:54.840
So the first step is to inspire young people,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.032
and in that room, Mohamed's presence

00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:00.508
had a really profound impact
on the youth in that room.

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:03.095
They had never really thought
about starting up a business.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:04.942
They've thought about working for an NGO,

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:06.629
working for the government,

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:10.936
but his story, his innovation,

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:12.889
really had a strong impact on them.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.008
He forced them to look at their city

00:07:15.008 --> 00:07:16.762
as a place of opportunity.

00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:20.510
He empowered them to believe
that they could be entrepreneurs,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.930
that they could be change makers.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.490
By the end of the day, they were coming up

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.041
with innovative solutions

00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:29.373
to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.

00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:31.976
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:34.898
to local problems.

00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:37.129
So inspiring young people

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:39.543
and creating a culture of entrepreneurship

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:41.410
is a really great step,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.099
but young people need capital

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:44.888
to make their ideas a reality.

00:07:44.888 --> 00:07:47.212
They need expertise and mentorship

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:50.612
to guide them in developing
and launching their businesses.

00:07:50.612 --> 00:07:53.099
Connect young people with the resources they need,

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.564
provide them the support they need
to go from ideation to creation,

00:07:56.564 --> 00:08:00.664
and you will create catalysts for urban growth.

00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:03.588
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:05.144
starting up a business.

00:08:05.144 --> 00:08:07.525
It's about creating a social impact.

00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:09.660
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.147
I believe he is selling hope.

00:08:12.147 --> 00:08:14.736
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:16.908
when it's created, will actually transform

00:08:16.908 --> 00:08:18.980
the way people see their city.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.133
Aden hired street kids to help rent out

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:22.995
and maintain those bikes for him.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.053
He gave them the opportunity to escape

00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:27.989
the paralysis of waithood.

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:30.019
These young entrepreneurs are having

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:33.553
a tremendous impact in their cities.

00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:36.069
So my suggestion is,

00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:38.585
turn youth into entrepreneurs,

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:41.808
incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:45.647
and you will have more stories
of flowers and Peace Parks

00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:48.740
than of car bombs and waithood.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.560
Thank you.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.073
(Applause)
