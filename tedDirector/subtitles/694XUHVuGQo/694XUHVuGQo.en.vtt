00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:20.307
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:23.637
my former professor of art history, and today

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:27.823
a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:31.794
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:35.582
to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:38.395
a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:41.022
the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:43.968
in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:47.071
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities

00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:50.998
for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:54.868
I decided, with some researchers from the United States

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:59.079
and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.198
decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:05.875
searching for the lost Leonardo.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.329
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.671
that was not exactly where we should be looking,

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:17.809
because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:22.144
came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:26.375
thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.614
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:32.470
the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.275
and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:39.155
and to find out the original doors, windows,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:43.914
and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:47.016
and then, with thermography, we went on to discover

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.247
hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:53.825
of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:57.138
of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:59.786
all the layout of this original hall

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.341
the way it was before there came Vasari,

00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:05.936
and restructured the whole thing,

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:09.272
including a staircase that was very important

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:13.411
in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.675
on a specific area of one of the two walls.

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:20.916
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:25.404
to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:29.736
by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:33.177
we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces

00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:36.434
specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:38.799
and leaving a small air gap.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.487
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:45.605
so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:48.991
like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,

00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.476
since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:55.983
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas

00:02:55.983 --> 00:03:01.211
just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:06.046
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:08.668
an air gap, and that's where

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:10.218
we believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:12.184
or at least the part that we know has been painted,

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:15.512
which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:19.105
Well, from there, unfortunately,

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:21.759
in 2004, the project

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.906
came to a halt. Many political reasons.

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:27.240
So I decided to go back to my alma mater,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.912
and, at the University of California, San Diego,

00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:32.278
and I proposed to open up a research center

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.090
for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.613
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:42.426
for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:45.189
and archaeology. So students started to flow in,

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.323
and we started to build technologies, because that's

00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:49.972
basically what we also needed in order to move forward

00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:52.732
and go and do fieldwork.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.130
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.761
and this time, with a great group of students,

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.201
and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.903
who is now the director at CISA3, and we

00:04:05.903 --> 00:04:10.076
came back just since we knew already where to look for

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:13.056
to find out if there was still something left.

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:17.189
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.186
for several reasons that it's not worth explaining,

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:23.932
to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,

00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:27.727
and with a 4mm camera attached to it,

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:32.516
we were successful in documenting and taking

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:37.320
some fragments of what it turns out to be

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.920
a reddish color, black color, and there is some

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.317
beige fragments that later on

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.311
we ran a much more sophisticated exams,

00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:52.551
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive

00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:55.214
so far. It seems to indicate that indeed

00:04:55.214 --> 00:04:58.270
we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.571
that no other artist has painted on that wall

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.090
before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.951
those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:09.566
and most likely to Leonardo.

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:14.389
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.630
work of art ever achieved by mankind.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.835
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:23.671
commission that Leonardo has ever had,

00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:28.284
and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:33.089
the number one artist influence at the time.

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.696
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.356
to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:43.427
but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,

00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:45.983
the state of conservation. See here the face of the

00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:50.707
Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it

00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:53.395
you suddenly see another, different lady,

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.690
aged lady, I should rather say.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.279
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.126
and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.

00:06:02.126 --> 00:06:05.883
But also, technology has helped to write new pages

00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:08.805
of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.

00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:10.943
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn,"

00:06:10.943 --> 00:06:13.421
another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.

00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:15.893
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:19.570
if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.929
And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately,

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:26.707
continuing with the scientific examination of this painting

00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:29.707
came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,

00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:32.364
did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting

00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:37.100
unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.991
of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately,

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:43.151
is not very reliable. (Laughter)

00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:45.751
Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:49.846
if science really could move in the field of authenticity

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:53.234
of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:56.395
to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.787
let me add. Take this example:

00:06:58.787 --> 00:07:02.481
Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life"

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.576
at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:10.311
and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed

00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.911
that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says

00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.926
when it was made and also the location.

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:20.325
So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:25.489
and so, again, authenticity and science could go together

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:29.786
and change the way, not attributions being made,

00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:33.629
but at least lay the ground for a more objective,

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.350
or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.098
as it is done today.

00:07:40.098 --> 00:07:43.392
But I would say the discovery that really caught

00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:47.499
my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:51.111
drawing under this layer, brown layer,

00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:54.363
of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see

00:07:54.363 --> 00:07:58.793
a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,

00:07:58.793 --> 00:08:02.000
and just peering through this brown layer

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.751
of this masterpiece to reveal

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.451
what could have been underneath.

00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:09.803
Well, this happens to be the most important painting

00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:12.660
we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.396
look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:21.087
for five centuries. Look at these portraits.

00:08:21.087 --> 00:08:23.460
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.117
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly

00:08:27.117 --> 00:08:30.024
on the ground layer of the panel, and see

00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:36.096
this cool thing, finding, I should rather say,

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:39.358
an elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,

00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:43.127
over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:46.457
This was an epiphany. We came to understand

00:08:46.457 --> 00:08:50.183
and to prove that the brown coating that we see today

00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:52.950
was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.457
only the other drawing that for five centuries

00:08:55.457 --> 00:09:00.667
we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:05.043
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:07.821
this pleasure, this privilege to see all this,

00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:11.359
to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:14.201
So we thought of an augmented reality application

00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:18.489
using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:22.078
what we could be doing, any of us could be doing,

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:24.253
in a museum environment.

00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:28.715
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?

00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:32.011
And we just aim the camera of the tablet

00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:38.142
to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.

00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:44.016
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause,

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:48.178
and now let me turn to you so the moment the image,

00:09:48.178 --> 00:09:51.531
or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,

00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:54.197
then the images you just saw up there in the drawing

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.954
are being loaded. And so, see.

00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:01.757
We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.

00:10:01.757 --> 00:10:06.702
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:09.959
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:14.500
and we see the elephant. (Applause)

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.044
(Applause)

00:10:18.044 --> 00:10:20.756
Okay? And then if we want,

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:23.536
we can continue the scroll to find out, for example,

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:27.631
on the staircase, the whole iconography is going

00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:29.959
to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:32.590
from the ruins of an old temple a new temple,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.378
and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?

00:10:36.378 --> 00:10:39.584
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes

00:10:39.584 --> 00:10:42.632
not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,

00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:44.983
the meaning of the painting,

00:10:44.983 --> 00:10:47.773
and we believe this is a cool way, easy way,

00:10:47.773 --> 00:10:50.913
that everybody could have access to, to become more

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:54.006
the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just

00:10:54.006 --> 00:10:57.380
be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.574
endless rooms of museums.

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:06.910
(Applause)

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.667
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:13.142
very obvious if we were to talk about real patients,

00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:15.398
but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,

00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:17.530
it's never been tapped as an idea.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.085
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,

00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:22.570
the very first step, to do real conservation,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.058
and allowing us to really explore and to understand

00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:28.849
everything related to the state of our conservation,

00:11:28.849 --> 00:11:32.223
the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:36.814
we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on

00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:40.345
the environment surrounding the painting.

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:43.755
Well, our vision is to rediscover

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:46.164
the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.773
where engineering for cultural heritage is actually

00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:52.475
a symbol of blending art and science together.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:54.905
We definitely need a new breed of engineers

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.638
that will go out and do this kind of work and

00:11:57.638 --> 00:12:01.980
rediscover for us these values, these cultural values

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.534
that we badly need, especially today.

00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:08.268
And if you want to summarize in one just single word,

00:12:08.268 --> 00:12:11.184
well, this is what we're trying to do.

00:12:11.184 --> 00:12:13.422
We're trying to give a future to our past

00:12:13.422 --> 00:12:15.824
in order to have a future.

00:12:15.824 --> 00:12:18.892
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,

00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:23.078
there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:28.855
(Applause)
