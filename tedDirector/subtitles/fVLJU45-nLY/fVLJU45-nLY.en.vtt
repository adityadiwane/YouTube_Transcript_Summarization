00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.399
I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:21.614
you hope you're not going to meet at TED.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:22.950
First, I don't have a mobile,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.781
so I'm on the safe side.

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:26.982
Secondly, a political theorist

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.447
who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:33.519
is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.002
And plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.836
I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:42.002
And one of the things that I want to question

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.719
is this very popular hope these days

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.653
that transparency and openness

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:50.953
can restore the trust in democratic institutions.

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:54.669
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:58.646
You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.854
(Laughter)

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:05.771
Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:08.686
As you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.270
And according to the surveys,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.837
we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:15.621
(Laughter)

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:19.211
The Economist magazine recently wrote an article

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.762
covering one of the recent studies on happiness,

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:26.596
and the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."

00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:28.196
(Laughter)

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:32.043
So now when you know what to expect,

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:33.479
let's give you the story.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.430
And this is a rainy election day in a small country --

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.762
that can be my country, but could be also your country.

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:45.562
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,

00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:48.247
nobody went to the polling stations.

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.012
But then the rain stopped,

00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:52.246
people went to vote.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:55.396
And when the votes had been counted,

00:01:55.396 --> 00:02:02.712
three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.062
The government and the opposition,

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.996
they have been simply paralyzed.

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:10.113
Because you know what to do about the protests.

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.097
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:17.445
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:21.778
So the government decided to have the elections once again.

00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:24.328
And this time even a greater number,

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:29.511
83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.

00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.262
Basically they went to the ballot boxes

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:35.328
to tell that they have nobody to vote for.

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:40.360
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.843
called "Seeing."

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:44.093
But in my view it very well captures

00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:48.477
part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:51.145
On one level nobody's questioning

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:55.044
that democracy is the best form of government.

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.780
Democracy is the only game in town.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.093
The problem is that many people start to believe

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:02.795
that it is not a game worth playing.

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:07.093
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed

00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:11.643
that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,

00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:15.561
and the people who are least interested to vote

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:20.198
are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:23.623
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.315
And this is a major issue.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.046
Because especially now with the economic crisis,

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:30.497
you can see that the trust in politics,

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:33.079
that the trust in democratic institutions,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.998
was really destroyed.

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:38.614
According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:43.496
89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap

00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:49.822
between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.

00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:53.830
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.980
believe that their vote matters.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.046
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:03.548
but they cannot change policies.

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:06.164
And the question which I want to ask is the following:

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:10.080
How did it happen that we are living in societies

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.630
which are much freer than ever before --

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.314
we have more rights, we can travel easier,

00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:17.663
we have access to more information --

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:21.047
at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions

00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:23.630
basically has collapsed?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.066
So basically I want to ask:

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:29.915
What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:31.716
when we talk about democracy?

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:35.599
And I'll start with what went right.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.661
And the first thing that went right was, of course,

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:41.132
these five revolutions which, in my view,

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:45.716
very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:50.941
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.756
which put the individual at the center of politics.

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:56.174
It was the human rights moment.

00:04:56.174 --> 00:05:00.024
Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,

00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:03.890
a culture of basically non-conformism,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.191
which was not known before.

00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.540
So I do believe that even things like that

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.992
are very much the children of '68 --

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:15.407
nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.

00:05:15.407 --> 00:05:18.456
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.

00:05:18.456 --> 00:05:22.090
And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.707
the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:

00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:28.384
"The government does not know better."

00:05:28.384 --> 00:05:31.291
And you have more choice-driven societies.

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:37.858
And of course, you have 1989 -- the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:40.158
And it was the birth of the global world.

00:05:40.158 --> 00:05:42.290
And you have the Internet.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.257
And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.674
to what extent the Internet empowered people.

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:50.507
It has changed the way we are communicating

00:05:50.507 --> 00:05:52.257
and basically we are viewing politics.

00:05:52.257 --> 00:05:55.275
The very idea of political community totally has changed.

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.590
And I'm going to name one more revolution,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.423
and this is the revolution in brain sciences,

00:05:59.423 --> 00:06:01.324
which totally changed the way

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:04.660
we understand how people are making decisions.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.624
So this is what went right.

00:06:07.624 --> 00:06:09.958
But if we're going to see what went wrong,

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.390
we're going to end up with the same five revolutions.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.891
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:18.757
cultural and social revolution,

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:22.324
which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.

00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:27.160
The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about --

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.957
nation, class, family.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.441
We start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.

00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:35.790
All this was very much under attack.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.141
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics

00:06:40.141 --> 00:06:42.840
when they believe that what really matters

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.009
is where they personally stand.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.759
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:54.720
and the huge increase of inequality in societies.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.626
Remember, until the 1970s,

00:06:56.626 --> 00:07:00.366
the spread of democracy has always been accompanied

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:03.826
by the decline of inequality.

00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:05.992
The more democratic our societies have been,

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:10.025
the more equal they have been becoming.

00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:12.359
Now we have the reverse tendency.

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:15.059
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.943
by the increase in inequality.

00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:20.177
And I find this very much disturbing

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:24.125
when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.009
with democracy these days.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.011
And if you go to 1989 --

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.525
something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize --

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:35.476
but many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:40.776
that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:42.693
When the Soviet Union was still there,

00:07:42.693 --> 00:07:46.076
the rich and the powerful, they needed the people,

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:48.359
because they feared them.

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:51.660
Now the elites basically have been liberated.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.825
They're very mobile. You cannot tax them.

00:07:53.825 --> 00:07:56.159
And basically they don't fear the people.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.176
So as a result of it, you have this very strange situation

00:07:59.176 --> 00:08:03.693
in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.

00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:05.192
So this is not by accident

00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:08.178
that the voters are not interested to vote anymore.

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:10.292
And when we talk about the Internet,

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.793
yes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:19.476
but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos

00:08:19.476 --> 00:08:24.578
in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.

00:08:24.578 --> 00:08:26.510
And it's becoming more and more difficult

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.276
to understand the people who are not like you.

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.144
I know that many people here

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:35.908
have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,

00:08:35.908 --> 00:08:39.942
but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:43.793
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.

00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:46.459
This is the other side of the things that we like.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.477
And when you go to the brain sciences,

00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:52.843
what political consultants learned from the brain scientists

00:08:52.843 --> 00:08:56.195
is don't talk to me about ideas anymore,

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:58.460
don't talk to me about policy programs.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.227
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:06.294
And you have this very strongly

00:09:06.294 --> 00:09:10.695
to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:16.694
these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.

00:09:16.694 --> 00:09:19.160
Before, revolutions used to have ideological names.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.093
They could be communist, they could be liberal,

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.878
they could be fascist or Islamic.

00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:27.126
Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.

00:09:27.126 --> 00:09:30.260
You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.660
The content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.195
I'm saying this because one of my major points

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:41.994
is what went right is also what went wrong.

00:09:41.994 --> 00:09:45.727
And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,

00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:48.676
when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,

00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:51.243
we should keep this ambiguity in mind.

00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:54.261
Because probably some of the things that we love most

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.462
are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.

00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:00.646
These days it's very popular to believe

00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:02.960
that this push for transparency,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:09.345
this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:13.009
and much more transparency-friendly legislation

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:16.077
can restore trust in politics.

00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:19.760
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.444
it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:25.959
it's going to be more difficult for them to steal

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.644
and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.

00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:31.660
This is probably true.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.710
But I do believe that we should be also very clear

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.977
that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics

00:10:39.977 --> 00:10:43.576
where the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:47.159
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.878
Transparency is politics' management of mistrust.

00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:56.410
We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.236
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.

00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:01.376
This is why you have checks and balances.

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:05.527
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust

00:11:05.527 --> 00:11:08.611
between the representatives and those whom they represent.

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:13.510
But when politics is only management of mistrust,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.593
then -- I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned --

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:20.343
now we're going to have "1984" in reverse.

00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:22.460
It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.760
it's going to be we being the Big Brother

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.510
watching the political class.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.126
But is this the idea of a free society?

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:31.660
For example, can you imagine

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:37.778
that decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:39.560
if they really do believe

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.360
that politics is also about managing mistrust?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.394
Are you not afraid with all these technologies

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.394
that are going to track down

00:11:48.394 --> 00:11:52.009
any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:55.876
are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians

00:11:55.876 --> 00:12:00.510
to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.527
because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?

00:12:04.527 --> 00:12:06.209
And the Americans who are in the room,

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:09.261
are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:12.636
on the basis of what they said in the primary elections?

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:14.627
I find this extremely important,

00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:18.659
because democracy is about people changing their views

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:21.809
based on rational arguments and discussions.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:25.293
And we can lose this with the very noble idea

00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:27.309
to keep people accountable

00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:29.927
for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate

00:12:29.927 --> 00:12:32.645
politicians the opportunism in politics.

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:34.977
So for me this is extremely important.

00:12:34.977 --> 00:12:38.243
And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,

00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:40.442
probably it makes sense

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:43.844
to look also at this type of a story.

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:47.394
But also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.

00:12:47.394 --> 00:12:51.159
[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:53.561
they're going to be selectively transparent.

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.593
In a small country that could be my country,

00:12:55.593 --> 00:12:57.026
but could be also your country,

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:59.211
they took a decision -- it is a real case story --

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:01.826
that all of the governmental decisions,

00:13:01.826 --> 00:13:04.392
discussions of the council of ministers,

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:07.693
were going to be published on the Internet

00:13:07.693 --> 00:13:12.093
24 hours after the council discussions took place.

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:14.261
And the public was extremely all for it.

00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.712
So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.310
why he made this decision.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.026
He said, "Listen, this is the best way

00:13:20.026 --> 00:13:24.654
to keep the mouths of my ministers closed.

00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:27.739
Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:29.921
knowing that 24 hours after

00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:31.825
this is going to be on the public space,

00:13:31.825 --> 00:13:35.771
and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."

00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:37.238
So when we talk about transparency,

00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:38.837
when we talk about openness,

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:40.954
I really do believe that what we should keep in mind

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:44.704
is that what went right is what went wrong.

00:13:44.704 --> 00:13:48.888
And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,

00:13:48.888 --> 00:13:51.370
some centuries ago he said,

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.707
"There is a big shadow where there is much light."

00:13:54.707 --> 00:13:56.239
Thank you very much.

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:57.889
(Applause)
