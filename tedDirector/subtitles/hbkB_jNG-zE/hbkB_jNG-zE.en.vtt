00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:18.174
Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN
created the World Wide Web.

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:22.083
Since then, the Internet has transformed 
the way we communicate,

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.545
the way we do business,
and even the way we live.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.717
In many ways,

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:32.542
the ideas that gave birth to Google,
Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.146
have now really transformed our lives,

00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:39.433
and this has brought us many real benefits
such as a more connected society.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.234
However, there are also
some downsides to this.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:45.967
Today, the average person
has an astounding amount

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.080
of personal information online,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.737
and we add to this online information
every single time we post on Facebook,

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:53.939
each time we search on Google,

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:55.721
and each time we send an email.

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.343
Now, many of us probably think,

00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:01.453
well, one email,
there's nothing in there, right?

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:04.659
But if you consider
a year's worth of emails,

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.561
or maybe even a lifetime of email,

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.907
collectively, this tells a lot.

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:13.470
It tells where we have been,
who we have met,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.709
and in many ways,
even what we're thinking about.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.086
And the more scary part about this is
our data now lasts forever,

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.093
so your data can and will outlive you.

00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:27.622
What has happened is that we've largely
lost control over our data

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.944
and also our privacy.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:33.474
So this year, as the web turns 25,

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:35.772
it's very important for us
to take a moment

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:38.304
and think about the implications of this.

00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:40.006
We have to really think.

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.796
We've lost privacy, yes,

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:45.125
but actually what we've also lost
is the idea of privacy itself.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:47.749
If you think about it,

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.763
most of us here today probably remember 
what life was like before the Internet,

00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:54.305
but today, there's a new generation

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.725
that is being taught from a very young age
to share everything online,

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:02.204
and this is a generation that is not 
going to remember when data was private.

00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:05.592
So we keep going down this road,
20 years from now,

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.688
the word 'privacy' is going to have
a completely different meaning

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:10.973
from what it means to you and I.

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:13.413
So, it's time for us 
to take a moment and think,

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:16.220
is there anything we can do about this?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.705
And I believe there is.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.266
Let's take a look at one of the most
widely used forms of communication

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.533
in the world today: email.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.294
Before the invention of email,
we largely communicated using letters,

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:30.616
and the process was quite simple.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.728
You would first start by writing
your message on a piece of paper,

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:36.132
then you would place it
into a sealed envelope,

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:38.387
and from there,
you would go ahead and send it

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.345
after you put a stamp and address on it.

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:41.825
Unfortunately, today,

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.642
when we actually send an email,
we're not sending a letter.

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:47.417
What you are sending, in many ways,
is actually a postcard,

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.064
and it's a postcard in the sense
that everybody that sees it

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:54.699
from the time it leaves your computer
to when it gets to the recipient

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.319
can actually read the entire contents.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.778
So, the solution to this
has been known for some time,

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:02.621
and there's many attempts to do it.

00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.770
The most basic solution
is to use encryption,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.697
and the idea is quite simple.

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:09.466
First, you encrypt the connection

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.074
between your computer
and the email server.

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:15.700
Then, you also encrypt the data
as it sits on the server itself.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.646
But there's a problem with this,

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:20.595
and that is, the email servers
also hold the encryption keys,

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:24.980
so now you have a really big lock
with a key placed right next to it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.211
But not only that, any government
could lawfully ask for

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:30.441
and get the key to your data,

00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:33.064
and this is all without you
being aware of it.

00:03:33.064 --> 00:03:38.337
So the way we fix this problem
is actually relatively easy, in principle:

00:03:38.337 --> 00:03:40.739
You give everybody their own keys,

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.012
and then you make sure the server
doesn't actually have the keys.

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:46.148
This seems like common sense, right?

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:49.751
So the question that comes up is,
why hasn't this been done yet?

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.796
Well, if we really think about it,

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.721
we see that the business model
of the Internet today

00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.788
really isn't compatible with privacy.

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:00.574
Just take a look at some
of the biggest names on the web,

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.501
and you see that advertising
plays a huge role.

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:08.329
In fact, this year alone,
advertising is 137 billion dollars,

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.500
and to optimize the ads
that are shown to us,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.633
companies have to know
everything about us.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.552
They need to know where we live,

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:18.207
how old we are, what we like,
what we don't like,

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.369
and anything else
they can get their hands on.

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:22.098
And if you think about it,

00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:26.246
the best way to get this information
is really just to invade our privacy.

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:29.437
So these companies
aren't going to give us our privacy.

00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:31.252
If we want to have privacy online,

00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:34.795
what we have to do is
we've got to go out and get it ourselves.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:37.063
For many years, when it came to email,

00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:39.978
the only solution
was something known as PGP,

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:43.192
which was quite complicated
and only accessible to the tech-savvy.

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:45.610
Here's a diagram that basically shows

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.345
the process for encrypting
and decrypting messages.

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:51.231
So needless to say,
this is not a solution for everybody,

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:54.363
and this actually is part of the problem,

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:56.825
because if you think about communication,

00:04:56.825 --> 00:05:01.180
by definition, it involves
having someone to communicate with.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.394
So while PGP does a great job
of what it's designed to do,

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:07.215
for the people out there
who can't understand how to use it,

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:10.117
the option to communicate privately
simply does not exist.

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:13.125
And this is a problem
that we need to solve.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.123
So if we want to have privacy online,

00:05:15.123 --> 00:05:18.442
the only way we can succeed
is if we get the whole world on board,

00:05:18.442 --> 00:05:21.693
and this is only possible
if we bring down the barrier to entry.

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:25.222
I think this is actually the key challenge
that lies in the tech community.

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:29.285
What we really have to do
is work and make privacy more accessible.

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:32.281
So last summer, when
the Edward Snowden story came out,

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.896
several colleagues and I decided to see
if we could make this happen.

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:40.883
At that time, we were working at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research

00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:44.614
at the world's largest particle collider,
which collides protons, by the way.

00:05:44.614 --> 00:05:48.059
We were all scientists,
so we used our scientific creativity

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.683
and came up with a very
creative name for our project:

00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:53.389
ProtonMail.
(Laughter)

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.257
Many startups these days
actually begin in people's garages

00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:57.941
or people's basements.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.438
We were a bit different.

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:02.081
We started out at the CERN cafeteria,

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:04.537
which actually is great, because look,

00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:07.010
you have all the food
and water you could ever want.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.490
But even better than this
is that every day

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.461
between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,
free of charge,

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.710
the CERN cafeteria comes with
several thousand scientists and engineers,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.496
and these guys basically know
the answers to everything.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:23.283
So it was in this environment
that we began working.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:26.394
What we actually want to do
is we want to take your email

00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:29.854
and turn it into something
that looks more like this,

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:32.129
but more importantly,
we want to do it in a way

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.274
that you can't even tell
that it's happened.

00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:37.261
So to do this, we actually need
a combination of technology

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:38.848
and also design.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.138
So how do we go about
doing something like this?

00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:46.172
Well, it's probably a good idea
not to put the keys on the server.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:50.070
So what we do is we generate
encryption keys on your computer,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.858
and we don't generate a single key,
but actually a pair of keys,

00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:57.563
so there's an RSA private key
and an RSA public key,

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:00.191
and these keys
are mathematically connected.

00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:02.396
So let's have a look
and see how this works

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:04.787
when multiple people communicate.

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:09.232
So here we have Bob and Alice,
who want to communicate privately.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:12.794
So the key challenge
is to take Bob's message

00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:17.103
and to get it to Alice in such a way
that the server cannot read that message.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.516
So what we have to do
is we have to encrypt it

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:21.640
before it even leaves Bob's computer,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.141
and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it
using the public key from Alice.

00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:31.333
Now this encrypted data is sent
through the server to Alice,

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:35.613
and because the message was encrypted
using Alice's public key,

00:07:35.613 --> 00:07:39.901
the only key that can now decrypt it
is a private key that belongs to Alice,

00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:44.616
and it turns out Alice is the only person
that actually has this key.

00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:47.284
So we've now accomplished the objective,

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:49.451
which is to get the message
from Bob to Alice

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:52.143
without the server being able
to read what's going on.

00:07:52.143 --> 00:07:55.100
Actually, what I've shown here
is a highly simplified picture.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.105
The reality is much more complex

00:07:57.105 --> 00:08:00.819
and it requires a lot of software
that looks a bit like this.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:03.259
And that's actually
the key design challenge:

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:06.780
How do we take all this complexity,
all this software,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.898
and implement it in a way
that the user cannot see it.

00:08:10.898 --> 00:08:14.496
I think with ProtonMail,
we have gotten pretty close to doing this.

00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:16.958
So let's see how it works in practice.

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.975
Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:21.945
who also want to communicate securely.

00:08:21.945 --> 00:08:24.132
They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:26.542
which is quite simple
and takes a few moments,

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.964
and all the key encryption and generation

00:08:28.964 --> 00:08:31.354
is happening automatically
in the background

00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:33.060
as Bob is creating his account.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.602
Once his account is created,
he just clicks "compose,"

00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:38.589
and now he can write his email
like he does today.

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:40.456
So he fills in his information,

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:43.740
and then after that, 
all he has to do is click "send,"

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.281
and just like that,
without understanding cryptography,

00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.834
and without doing anything different
from how he writes email today,

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:53.481
Bob has just sent an encrypted message.

00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:57.593
What we have here
is really just the first step,

00:08:57.593 --> 00:08:59.890
but it shows that
with improving technology,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.065
privacy doesn't have to be difficult,
it doesn't have to be disruptive.

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:08.512
If we change the goal from maximizing 
ad revenue to protecting data,

00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:11.008
we can actually make it accessible.

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:13.468
Now, I know a question
on everybody's minds is,

00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:15.858
okay, protecting privacy,
this is a great goal,

00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:18.298
but can you actually do this

00:09:18.298 --> 00:09:21.090
without the tons of money
that advertisements give you?

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.476
And I think the answer is actually yes,

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:25.706
because today, we've reached a point

00:09:25.706 --> 00:09:29.652
where people around the world really
understand how important privacy is,

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.625
and when you have that,
anything is possible.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:33.789
Earlier this year,

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:37.454
ProtonMail actually had so many users 
that we ran out of resources,

00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:40.283
and when this happened,
our community of users got together

00:09:40.283 --> 00:09:42.399
and donated half a million dollars.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.830
So this is just an example
of what can happen

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.643
when you bring the community together
towards a common goal.

00:09:47.643 --> 00:09:49.379
We can also leverage the world.

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:50.597
Right now,

00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:54.023
we have a quarter of a million people
that have signed up for ProtonMail,

00:09:54.023 --> 00:09:55.832
and these people come from everywhere,

00:09:55.832 --> 00:09:57.464
and this really shows that privacy

00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:59.716
is not just an American
or a European issue,

00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:02.061
it's a global issue
that impacts all of us.

00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:05.521
It's something that we really
have to pay attention to going forward.

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.517
So what do we have to do
to solve this problem?

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.514
Well, first of all,

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:13.508
we need to support a different
business model for the Internet,

00:10:13.508 --> 00:10:15.841
one that does not rely
entirely on advertisements

00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.175
for revenue and for growth.

00:10:18.175 --> 00:10:20.684
We actually need to build a new Internet

00:10:20.684 --> 00:10:26.377
where our privacy and our ability 
to control our data is first and foremost.

00:10:26.377 --> 00:10:28.122
But even more importantly,

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:32.990
we have to build an Internet 
where privacy is no longer just an option

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.893
but is also the default.

00:10:35.923 --> 00:10:38.493
We have done the first step
with ProtonMail,

00:10:38.493 --> 00:10:42.074
but this is really just the first step
in a very, very long journey.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.997
The good news I can share
with you guys today,

00:10:44.997 --> 00:10:47.525
the exciting news,
is that we're not traveling alone.

00:10:47.525 --> 00:10:50.375
The movement to protect people's privacy
and freedom online

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.861
is really gaining momentum,

00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:55.455
and today, there are dozens of projects
from all around the world

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:58.966
who are working together
to improve our privacy.

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:02.612
These projects protect things
from our chat to voice communications,

00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:05.416
also our file storage, our online search,

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:08.457
our online browsing,
and many other things.

00:11:08.457 --> 00:11:11.986
And these projects are not backed
by billions of dollars in advertising,

00:11:11.986 --> 00:11:14.309
but they've found support
really from the people,

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:17.356
from private individuals like you and I
from all over the world.

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:20.473
This really matters, because ultimately,

00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:23.944
privacy depends on each
and every one of us,

00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:26.777
and we have to protect it now
because our online data

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:29.541
is more than just a collection
of ones and zeros.

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.397
It's actually a lot more than that.

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:33.743
It's our lives, our personal stories,

00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:36.041
our friends, our families,

00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:39.547
and in many ways,
also our hopes and our aspirations.

00:11:39.547 --> 00:11:42.651
We need to spend time now
to really protect our right

00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.601
to share this only with people
that we want to share this with,

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.341
because without this,
we simply can't have a free society.

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.194
So now's the time for us
to collectively stand up and say,

00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:54.687
yes, we do want to live
in a world with online privacy,

00:11:54.687 --> 00:11:59.215
and yes, we can work together
to turn this vision into a reality.

00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:01.350
Thank you.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:08.107
(Applause)
