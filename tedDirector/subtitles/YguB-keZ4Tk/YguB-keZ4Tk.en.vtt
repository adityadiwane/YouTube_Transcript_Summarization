00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
This may sound strange,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
with a very simple idea:

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
modules made of cement of a fixed measurement

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that fit together.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Very quickly concrete blocks became

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
the most-used construction unit in the world.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
buildings, bridges,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
one brick at a time.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Essentially concrete blocks had become

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the building block of our time.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
LEGO came up with this.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And in a few short years,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
LEGO bricks took place in every household.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
You don't have to be an engineer

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
LEGO made it accessible.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and made it into the building block

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
of our imagination.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Meanwhile the exact same year,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
the next building block.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
The transistor was a small plastic unit

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that would take us from a world

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
of static bricks piled on top of each other

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to a world where everything was interactive.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Like the concrete block,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
the transistor allows you to build

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
But there's a main difference:

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
The transistor was only for experts.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I personally don't accept this,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
that the building block of our time

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
is reserved for experts,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
so I decided to change that.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I started exploring this idea

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
of how to put the power of engineers

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in the hands of artists and designers.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Let me show you how they work.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
LittleBits are electronic modules

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
with each one specific function.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
They're pre-engineered

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
to be light, sound,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
motors and sensors.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And the best part about it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
is they snap together with magnets.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
So you can't put them the wrong way.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The bricks are color-coded.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Green is output, blue is power,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
pink is input and orange is wire.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You put a blue to a green,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
you can make light.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
You can put a knob in between

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and now you've made a little dimmer.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Switch out the knob

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
for a pulse module,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
which is here,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and now you've made a little blinker.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Add this buzzer

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
for some extra punch

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and you've created a noise machine.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
I'm going to stop that.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So beyond simple play,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
littleBits allow you to program

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
using very simple intuitive gestures.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
So to make this blink faster or slower,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
you would just turn this knob

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and basically make it pulse faster or slower.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The idea behind littleBits

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
is that it's a growing library.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
We want to make every single interaction in the world

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
into a ready-to-use brick.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
everything should be accessible.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And it's been an incredible experience.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
The nicest thing is how they start to understand

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
the electronics around them from everyday

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that they don't learn at schools.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
For example, how a nightlight works,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
or why an elevator door stays open,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
or how an iPod responds to touch.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So for example, we've had designers

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
with no experience with electronics whatsoever

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
start to play with littleBits as a material.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
we have Geordie making ...

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
(Clanging)

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
(Buzzing)

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and gave them to some designers

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
with no experience in engineering whatsoever --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Here's an example of a project they made,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
a motion-activated confetti canon ball.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
(Laughter)

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It's a lobster made of playdough

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that's afraid of the dark.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
(Laughter)

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
electronics became just another material.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So littleBits is open-source.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
We want to encourage a world

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
of creators, of inventors, of contributors,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
because this world that we live in,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
this interactive world, is ours.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
So go ahead and start inventing.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Thank you.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
(Applause)
