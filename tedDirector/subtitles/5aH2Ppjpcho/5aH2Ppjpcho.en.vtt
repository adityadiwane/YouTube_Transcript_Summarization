00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:16.809
I want to talk a little bit today
about labor and work.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.222
When we think about how people work,

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.615
the naive intuition we have

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:26.003
is that people are like rats in a maze --

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:27.996
that all people care about is money,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.672
and the moment we give them money,

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.394
we can direct them to work one way,

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:33.398
we can direct them to work another way.

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:37.033
This is why we give bonuses to bankers
and pay in all kinds of ways.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.525
And we really have
this incredibly simplistic view

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.819
of why people work, and what
the labor market looks like.

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:47.166
At the same time, if you think about it,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.499
there's all kinds of strange behaviors
in the world around us.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.251
Think about something like mountaineering
and mountain climbing.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:58.526
If you read books of people
who climb mountains, difficult mountains,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.239
do you think that those books are full
of moments of joy and happiness?

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.016
No, they are full of misery.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.698
In fact, it's all about frostbite
and having difficulty walking,

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.382
and difficulty breathing --

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.444
cold, challenging circumstances.

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:16.922
And if people were just trying
to be happy,

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:18.803
the moment they would get to the top,

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:20.952
they would say,
"This was a terrible mistake.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:22.357
I'll never do it again."

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.498
(Laughter)

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:27.137
"Instead, let me sit on a beach
somewhere drinking mojitos."

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:30.835
But instead, people go down,

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.177
and after they recover, they go up again.

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.826
And if you think about
mountain climbing as an example,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.865
it suggests all kinds of things.

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:42.793
It suggests that we care
about reaching the end, a peak.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.642
It suggests that we care
about the fight, about the challenge.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:50.126
It suggests that there's all kinds
of other things that motivate us

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.497
to work or behave in all kinds of ways.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.797
And for me personally,
I started thinking about this

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:59.614
after a student came to visit me.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:03.990
This was one of my students
from a few years earlier,

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:05.798
and he came one day back to campus.

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:08.047
And he told me the following story:

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.781
He said that for more than two weeks,

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.472
he was working
on a PowerPoint presentation.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.596
He was working in a big bank,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.009
and this was in preparation
for a merger and acquisition.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.921
And he was working very hard
on this presentation --

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:23.930
graphs, tables, information.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:26.901
He stayed late at night every day.

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.654
And the day before it was due,

00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.988
he sent his PowerPoint
presentation to his boss,

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:35.618
and his boss wrote him back and said,

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:39.134
"Nice presentation,
but the merger is canceled."

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.157
And the guy was deeply depressed.

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:44.635
Now at the moment when he was working,

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.519
he was actually quite happy.

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:48.798
Every night he was enjoying his work,

00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:53.496
he was staying late, he was perfecting
this PowerPoint presentation.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.191
But knowing that nobody would ever
watch it made him quite depressed.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.303
So I started thinking
about how do we experiment

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:04.596
with this idea of the fruits of our labor.

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:09.564
And to start with, we created
a little experiment

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.594
in which we gave people Legos,

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:15.142
and we asked them to build with Legos.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.477
And for some people,
we gave them Legos and we said,

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:24.246
"Hey, would you like to build
this Bionicle for three dollars?

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.320
We'll pay you three dollars for it."

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:29.491
And people said yes,
and they built with these Legos.

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:33.438
And when they finished, we took it,
we put it under the table,

00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:36.447
and we said, "Would you like
to build another one,

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:38.096
this time for $2.70?"

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.488
If they said yes,
we gave them another one,

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.369
and when they finished, we asked them,

00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:46.213
"Do you want to build another one?"
for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,

00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:48.087
until at some point people said,

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:50.832
"No more. It's not worth it for me."

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:54.754
This was what we called
the meaningful condition.

00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:57.805
People built one Bionicle after another.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.655
After they finished every one of them,

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.024
we put them under the table.

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:03.432
And we told them that at the end
of the experiment,

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:06.532
we will take all these Bionicles,
we will disassemble them,

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:08.379
we will put them back in the boxes,

00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:10.743
and we will use it
for the next participant.

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.258
There was another condition.

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:17.338
This other condition was inspired
by David, my student.

00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:21.242
And this other condition we called
the Sisyphic condition.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:23.451
And if you remember
the story about Sisyphus,

00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:28.702
Sisyphus was punished by the gods
to push the same rock up a hill,

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.787
and when he almost got to the end,

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.771
the rock would roll over,
and he would have to start again.

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:38.667
And you can think about this
as the essence of doing futile work.

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:41.644
You can imagine that if he pushed
the rock on different hills,

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:44.292
at least he would have
some sense of progress.

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.000
Also, if you look at prison movies,

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:50.183
sometimes the way that the guards
torture the prisoners

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:53.842
is to get them to dig a hole,
and when the prisoner is finished,

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:56.865
they ask him to fill the hole
back up and then dig again.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.071
There's something
about this cyclical version

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:01.710
of doing something over and over and over

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.187
that seems to be
particularly demotivating.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:06.782
So in the second condition
of this experiment,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.472
that's exactly what we did.

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:09.783
We asked people,

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:12.966
"Would you like to build
one Bionicle for three dollars?"

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.879
And if they said yes, they built it.

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.714
Then we asked them, "Do you want
to build another one for $2.70?"

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:21.882
And if they said yes,
we gave them a new one,

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:23.691
and as they were building it,

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:26.428
we took apart the one
that they just finished.

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:29.112
And when they finished that,

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:31.308
we said, "Would you like
to build another one,

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:32.854
this time for 30 cents less?"

00:05:32.878 --> 00:05:34.077
And if they said yes,

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:37.252
we gave them the one
that they built and we broke.

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:40.863
So this was an endless cycle
of them building,

00:05:40.887 --> 00:05:43.413
and us destroying in front of their eyes.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:48.319
Now what happens when you compare
these two conditions?

00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:51.874
The first thing that happened was
that people built many more Bionicles --

00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:54.136
eleven in the meaningful condition,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.898
versus seven in the Sisyphus condition.

00:05:56.922 --> 00:06:00.035
And by the way, we should point out
that this was not big meaning.

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.596
People were not curing cancer
or building bridges.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.359
People were building
Bionicles for a few cents.

00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:08.336
And not only that, everybody knew

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.662
that the Bionicles
would be destroyed quite soon.

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:14.517
So there was not a real
opportunity for big meaning.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.646
But even the small meaning
made a difference.

00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.789
Now we had another version
of this experiment.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.728
In this other version of the experiment,

00:06:22.752 --> 00:06:24.695
we didn't put people in this situation,

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.725
we just described to them the situation,

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:28.855
much as I am describing to you now,

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.234
and we asked them to predict
what the result would be.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.417
What happened?

00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:37.117
People predicted the right direction
but not the right magnitude.

00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:41.174
People who were just given
the description of the experiment

00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:43.086
said that in the meaningful condition,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.768
people would probably build
one more Bionicle.

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.021
So people understand
that meaning is important,

00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.879
they just don't understand
the magnitude of the importance,

00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:52.854
the extent to which it's important.

00:06:53.657 --> 00:06:56.101
There was one other piece
of data we looked at.

00:06:56.474 --> 00:06:59.331
If you think about it, there are
some people who love Legos,

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:00.817
and some people who don't.

00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:03.404
And you would speculate
that the people who love Legos

00:07:03.428 --> 00:07:05.520
would build more Legos,
even for less money,

00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:08.741
because after all,
they get more internal joy from it.

00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:11.861
And the people who love Legos less
would build less Legos

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:14.789
because the enjoyment
that they derive from it is lower.

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:17.741
And that's actually what we found
in the meaningful condition.

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:20.574
There was a very nice correlation
between the love of Legos

00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.703
and the amount of Legos people built.

00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:25.254
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.290
In that condition,
the correlation was zero --

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.035
there was no relationship
between the love of Legos,

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.822
and how much people built,

00:07:32.846 --> 00:07:35.521
which suggests to me
that with this manipulation

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:37.983
of breaking things
in front of people's eyes,

00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:42.556
we basically crushed any joy
that they could get out of this activity.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.238
We basically eliminated it.

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:49.054
Soon after I finished
running this experiment,

00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:52.498
I went to talk to a big
software company in Seattle.

00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:57.236
I can't tell you who they were,
but they were a big company in Seattle.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.348
This was a group
within the software company

00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:01.164
that was put in a different building,

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:02.808
and they asked them to innovate,

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:06.090
and create the next big product
for this company.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.119
And the week before I showed up,

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:12.550
the CEO of this big software company
went to that group, 200 engineers,

00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:14.522
and canceled the project.

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.341
And I stood there in front of 200

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:20.441
of the most depressed
people I've ever talked to.

00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:23.637
And I described to them
some of these Lego experiments,

00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:28.561
and they said they felt like they had
just been through that experiment.

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:30.276
And I asked them, I said,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.892
"How many of you now show up
to work later than you used to?"

00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:35.870
And everybody raised their hand.

00:08:35.894 --> 00:08:39.069
I said, "How many of you now go home
earlier than you used to?"

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:40.619
Everybody raised their hand.

00:08:41.006 --> 00:08:43.685
I asked them, "How many of you now add

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:46.842
not-so-kosher things
to your expense reports?"

00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:48.517
And they didn't raise their hands,

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:49.986
but they took me out to dinner

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.599
and showed me what they could do
with expense reports.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.032
And then I asked them, I said,

00:08:56.056 --> 00:09:00.397
"What could the CEO have done
to make you not as depressed?"

00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.524
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.

00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:05.929
They said the CEO could have asked
them to present to the whole company

00:09:05.953 --> 00:09:07.956
about their journey
over the last two years

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.382
and what they decided to do.

00:09:09.406 --> 00:09:13.166
He could have asked them to think
about which aspect of their technology

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.512
could fit with other parts
of the organization.

00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:19.854
He could have asked them to build
some next-generation prototypes,

00:09:19.878 --> 00:09:21.879
and see how they would work.

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:26.888
But the thing is that any one of those
would require some effort and motivation.

00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:31.092
And I think the CEO basically did not
understand the importance of meaning.

00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:33.314
If the CEO, just like our participants,

00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:36.299
thought the essence
of meaning is unimportant,

00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:37.537
then he [wouldn't] care.

00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:40.460
And he would say, "At the moment
I directed you in this way,

00:09:40.484 --> 00:09:42.507
and now that I'm directing
you in this way,

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:44.053
everything will be okay."

00:09:44.077 --> 00:09:46.752
But if you understood
how important meaning is,

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:49.354
then you would figure out
that it's actually important

00:09:49.378 --> 00:09:51.172
to spend some time, energy and effort

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:54.100
in getting people to care more
about what they're doing.

00:09:55.322 --> 00:09:57.433
The next experiment
was slightly different.

00:09:57.457 --> 00:10:00.092
We took a sheet of paper
with random letters,

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:02.203
and we asked people
to find pairs of letters

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.258
that were identical next to each other.

00:10:04.282 --> 00:10:05.442
That was the task.

00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:06.870
People did the first sheet,

00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:10.239
then we asked if they wanted to do
another for a little less money,

00:10:10.263 --> 00:10:13.139
the next sheet for a little bit
less, and so on and so forth.

00:10:13.163 --> 00:10:14.723
And we had three conditions.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:18.327
In the first condition, people
wrote their name on the sheet,

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.641
found all the pairs of letters,

00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:22.306
gave it to the experimenter,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.213
the experimenter would look at it,

00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:25.972
scan it from top to bottom,

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:29.910
say "Uh huh," and put it
on the pile next to them.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.966
In the second condition,
people did not write their name on it.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.355
The experimenter looked at it,

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:39.322
took the sheet of paper,
did not look at it, did not scan it,

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:42.950
and simply put it on the pile of pages.

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:45.510
So you take a piece,
you just put it on the side.

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:46.859
In the third condition,

00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:49.226
the experimenter got the sheet of paper,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.732
and put it directly into a shredder.

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:53.756
(Laughter)

00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:57.970
What happened in those three conditions?

00:10:57.994 --> 00:11:02.196
In this plot I'm showing you
at what pay rate people stopped.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.802
So low numbers mean
that people worked harder.

00:11:04.826 --> 00:11:06.928
They worked for much longer.

00:11:06.952 --> 00:11:08.506
In the acknowledged condition,

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.630
people worked all the way
down to 15 cents.

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:13.271
At 15 cents per page,

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:15.119
they basically stopped these efforts.

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:20.129
In the shredder condition, it was twice
as much -- 30 cents per sheet.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:22.392
And this is basically
the result we had before.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:25.780
You shred people's efforts, output --

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:28.464
you get them not to be as happy
with what they're doing.

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.192
But I should point out, by the way,

00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:32.946
that in the shredder condition,
people could have cheated.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.975
They could have done not so good work,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:37.498
because they realized
people were just shredding it.

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:39.609
So maybe the first sheet
you'd do good work,

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:41.768
but then you see nobody
is really testing it,

00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:43.705
so you would do more and more and more.

00:11:43.729 --> 00:11:45.569
So in fact, in the shredder condition,

00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:48.427
people could have submitted more work
and gotten more money,

00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:49.831
and put less effort into it.

00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:52.416
But what about the ignored condition?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.170
Would the ignored condition
be more like the acknowledged

00:11:55.194 --> 00:11:58.113
or more like the shredder,
or somewhere in the middle?

00:11:58.137 --> 00:12:00.561
It turns out it was
almost like the shredder.

00:12:01.473 --> 00:12:04.141
Now there's good news and bad news here.

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:08.980
The bad news is that ignoring
the performance of people

00:12:09.004 --> 00:12:13.276
is almost as bad as shredding
their effort in front of their eyes.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.649
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.

00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:21.522
The good news is that by simply looking
at something that somebody has done,

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:23.539
scanning it and saying "Uh huh,"

00:12:23.563 --> 00:12:25.149
that seems to be quite sufficient

00:12:25.173 --> 00:12:27.942
to dramatically improve
people's motivations.

00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:31.365
So the good news is that adding motivation

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:33.888
doesn't seem to be so difficult.

00:12:33.912 --> 00:12:36.066
The bad news is
that eliminating motivations

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.841
seems to be incredibly easy,

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:41.657
and if we don't think about it
carefully, we might overdo it.

00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:45.092
So this is all in terms
of negative motivation,

00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:47.450
or eliminating negative motivation.

00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:51.905
The next part I want to show you
is something about positive motivation.

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:56.160
So there is a store
in the U.S. called IKEA.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.175
And IKEA is a store
with kind of okay furniture

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.183
that takes a long time to assemble.

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:05.316
(Laughter)

00:13:05.714 --> 00:13:06.866
I don't know about you,

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.763
but every time I assemble one of those,

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.128
it takes me much longer,
it's much more effortful,

00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:14.517
it's much more confusing,
I put things in the wrong way --

00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:17.766
I can't say I enjoy those pieces.

00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:20.473
I can't say I enjoy the process.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.676
But when I finish it,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.818
I seem to like those
IKEA pieces of furniture

00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:26.694
more than I like other ones.

00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:27.774
(Laughter)

00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:31.151
And there's an old story about cake mixes.

00:13:31.758 --> 00:13:34.985
So when they started
cake mixes in the '40s,

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:38.465
they would take this powder
and they would put it in a box,

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:41.530
and they would ask housewives
to basically pour it in,

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.276
stir some water in it,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.562
mix it, put it in the oven,
and -- voila -- you had cake.

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:49.615
But it turns out they were very unpopular.

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:51.450
People did not want them,

00:13:51.474 --> 00:13:53.999
and they thought about
all kinds of reasons for that.

00:13:54.023 --> 00:13:55.432
Maybe the taste was not good?

00:13:55.456 --> 00:13:56.632
No, the taste was great.

00:13:56.656 --> 00:14:01.656
What they figured out was
that there was not enough effort involved.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.057
It was so easy that nobody
could serve cake to their guests

00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:07.365
and say, "Here is my cake."

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.965
No, it was somebody else's cake,
as if you bought it in the store.

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:13.232
It didn't really feel like your own.

00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:15.019
So what did they do?

00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:18.289
They took the eggs and the milk
out of the powder.

00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:20.039
(Laughter)

00:14:20.063 --> 00:14:23.880
Now you had to break
the eggs and add them,

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:27.060
you had to measure the milk
and add it, mixing it.

00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:29.917
Now it was your cake.
Now everything was fine.

00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.305
(Laughter)

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:39.251
(Applause)

00:14:39.904 --> 00:14:42.133
Now, I think a little bit
like the IKEA effect,

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:43.785
by getting people to work harder,

00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:46.222
they actually got them to love
what they're doing

00:14:46.246 --> 00:14:47.762
to a higher degree.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.586
So how do we look at this
question experimentally?

00:14:51.046 --> 00:14:53.199
We asked people to build some origami.

00:14:53.223 --> 00:14:55.976
We gave them instructions
on how to create origami,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.738
and we gave them a sheet of paper.

00:14:57.762 --> 00:14:59.580
And these were all novices,

00:14:59.604 --> 00:15:02.158
and they built something
that was really quite ugly --

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:04.317
nothing like a frog or a crane.

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:08.127
But then we told them,
"Look, this origami really belongs to us.

00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:11.175
You worked for us, but I'll tell
you what, we'll sell it to you.

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:13.203
How much do you want to pay for it?"

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.286
And we measured how much
they were willing to pay for it.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.118
And we had two types of people:

00:15:18.142 --> 00:15:20.086
We had the people who built it,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.889
and the people who did not build it,

00:15:21.913 --> 00:15:24.713
and just looked at it
as external observers.

00:15:25.173 --> 00:15:27.404
And what we found
was that the builders thought

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:30.056
that these were beautiful
pieces of origami --

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.342
(Laughter)

00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:33.857
and they were willing to pay
five times more for them

00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:36.485
than the people who just
evaluated them externally.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.918
Now you could say --
if you were a builder,

00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:43.110
do you think [you'd say],
"Oh, I love this origami,

00:15:43.134 --> 00:15:45.728
but I know that nobody
else would love it?"

00:15:46.474 --> 00:15:51.868
Or "I love this origami,
and everybody else will love it as well?"

00:15:51.892 --> 00:15:54.273
Which one of those two is correct?

00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:57.749
Turns out the builders
not only loved the origami more,

00:15:57.773 --> 00:16:01.077
they thought that everybody
would see the world in their view.

00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:03.793
They thought everybody else
would love it more as well.

00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:06.889
In the next version,
we tried to do the IKEA effect.

00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:08.777
We tried to make it more difficult.

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:11.754
So for some people, we gave the same task.

00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:15.636
For some people, we made it harder
by hiding the instructions.

00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:18.383
At the top of the sheet,
we had little diagrams

00:16:18.407 --> 00:16:20.366
of how you fold origami.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.719
For some people, we just eliminated that.

00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:24.484
So now this was tougher.

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:26.024
What happened?

00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:28.095
Well in an objective way,

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:31.585
the origami now was uglier,
it was more difficult.

00:16:32.064 --> 00:16:35.071
Now when we looked at the easy
origami, we saw the same thing --

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:38.317
builders loved it more,
evaluators loved it less.

00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:40.500
When you looked at the hard instructions,

00:16:40.524 --> 00:16:43.222
the effect was larger.

00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:44.398
Why?

00:16:44.422 --> 00:16:47.492
Because now the builders
loved it even more.

00:16:47.516 --> 00:16:48.722
(Laughter)

00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:50.902
They put all this extra effort into it.

00:16:51.352 --> 00:16:53.188
And evaluators?

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.839
They loved it even less.

00:16:54.863 --> 00:16:58.712
Because in reality, it was even uglier
than the first version.

00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.077
(Laughter)

00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:04.073
Of course, this tells you something
about how we evaluate things.

00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:06.414
Now think about kids.

00:17:07.216 --> 00:17:10.323
Imagine I asked you, "How much
would you sell your kids for?"

00:17:11.748 --> 00:17:13.756
Your memories and associations and so on.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.419
Most people would say
for a lot, a lot of money.

00:17:16.443 --> 00:17:17.607
(Laughter)

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.015
On good days.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.279
(Laughter)

00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:22.208
But imagine this was slightly different.

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:24.042
Imagine if you did not have your kids.

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:26.801
And one day you went to the park
and you met some kids.

00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:28.307
They were just like your kids,

00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.349
and you played with them for a few hours,

00:17:30.373 --> 00:17:33.722
and when you were about to leave,
the parents said, "Hey, by the way,

00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:36.729
just before you leave,
if you're interested, they're for sale."

00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:38.859
(Laughter)

00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:41.113
How much would you pay for them now?

00:17:41.803 --> 00:17:43.900
Most people say not that much.

00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:48.719
And this is because our kids
are so valuable,

00:17:48.743 --> 00:17:50.873
not just because of who they are,

00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:52.508
but because of us,

00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:54.692
because they are so connected to us,

00:17:54.716 --> 00:17:57.287
and because of the time and connection.

00:17:57.311 --> 00:18:00.218
By the way, if you think
IKEA instructions are not good,

00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:03.630
what about the instructions that come
with kids, those are really tough.

00:18:03.654 --> 00:18:04.662
(Laughter)

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:08.928
By the way, these are my kids, which,
of course, are wonderful and so on.

00:18:08.952 --> 00:18:10.876
Which comes to tell you one more thing,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.350
which is, much like our builders,

00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:17.215
when they look at the creature
of their creation,

00:18:17.239 --> 00:18:20.503
we don't see that other people
don't see things our way.

00:18:22.463 --> 00:18:24.297
Let me say one last comment.

00:18:25.162 --> 00:18:28.955
If you think about Adam Smith
versus Karl Marx,

00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:32.194
Adam Smith had a very important
notion of efficiency.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.892
He gave an example of a pin factory.

00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:38.421
He said pins have 12 different steps,

00:18:38.445 --> 00:18:42.350
and if one person does all 12 steps,
production is very low.

00:18:42.818 --> 00:18:44.946
But if you get one person to do step one,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.723
and one person to do step two
and step three and so on,

00:18:47.747 --> 00:18:50.358
production can increase tremendously.

00:18:50.382 --> 00:18:52.121
And indeed, this is a great example,

00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:55.596
and the reason for the Industrial
Revolution and efficiency.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.856
Karl Marx, on the other hand,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.341
said that the alienation
of labor is incredibly important

00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:04.761
in how people think about the connection
to what they are doing.

00:19:04.785 --> 00:19:08.055
And if you do all 12 steps,
you care about the pin.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:11.531
But if you do one step every time,
maybe you don't care as much.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:15.353
I think that in the Industrial Revolution,

00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:17.964
Adam Smith was more
correct than Karl Marx.

00:19:18.488 --> 00:19:21.323
But the reality is that we've switched,

00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:23.355
and now we're in the knowledge economy.

00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:26.266
You can ask yourself, what happens
in a knowledge economy?

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.537
Is efficiency still more
important than meaning?

00:19:29.561 --> 00:19:30.971
I think the answer is no.

00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:33.189
I think that as we move to situations

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:36.172
in which people have
to decide on their own

00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:40.366
about how much effort, attention,
caring, how connected they feel to it,

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.765
are they thinking about labor
on the way to work,

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:44.366
and in the shower and so on,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.978
all of a sudden Marx
has more things to say to us.

00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:50.249
So when we think about labor,

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.673
we usually think about motivation
and payment as the same thing,

00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:57.299
but the reality is that we should
probably add all kinds of things to it --

00:19:57.323 --> 00:20:01.519
meaning, creation, challenges,
ownership, identity, pride, etc.

00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:04.506
The good news is that if we added
all of those components

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.108
and thought about them --

00:20:06.132 --> 00:20:09.545
how do we create our own
meaning, pride, motivation,

00:20:09.569 --> 00:20:11.419
and how do we do it in our workplace,

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.841
and for the employees --

00:20:12.865 --> 00:20:16.830
I think we could get people to be
both more productive and happier.

00:20:16.854 --> 00:20:18.160
Thank you very much.

00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:19.984
(Applause)
