00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:13.988
Is there a real you?

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:16.338
This might seem to you 
like a very odd question.

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:18.897
Because, you might ask,

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:21.225
how do we find the real you,

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.259
how do you know what the real you is?

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.223
And so forth.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.591
But the idea that there must be a real you,

00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:28.634
surely that's obvious.

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.895
If there's anything real 
in the world, it's you.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.840
Well, I'm not quite sure.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.457
At least we have to understand 
a bit better what that means.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:40.291
Now certainly, I think there are
lots of things in our culture around us

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.498
which sort of reinforce the idea

00:00:42.498 --> 00:00:46.249
that for each one of us,
we have a kind of a core, an essence.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.683
There is something about what it means
to be you which defines you,

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.003
and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.813
The most kind of crude way
in which we have it,

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:55.107
are things like horoscopes.

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:58.147
You know, people are very wedded
to these, actually.

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:00.111
People put them on their Facebook profile

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.594
as though they are meaningul,

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.271
you even know 
your Chinese horoscope as well.

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:06.724
There are also 
more scientific versions of this,

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.781
all sorts of ways of profiling
personality type,

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.454
such as the Myers-Briggs tests,
for example.

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:13.835
I don't know if you've done those.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.739
A lot of companies 
use these for recruitment.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:19.036
You answer a lot of questions,

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.792
and this is supposed to reveal
something about your core personality.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.093
And of course, the popular fascination 
with this is enormous.

00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:27.761
In magazines like this, you'll see,

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:31.223
in the bottom left corner,
they'll advertise in virtually every issue

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.333
some kind of personality thing.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.113
And if you pick up one of those magazines,

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:36.361
it's hard to resist, isn't it?

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.226
Doing the test to find
what is your learning style,

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:42.354
what is your loving style,
or what is your working style?

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.954
Are you this kind of person or that?

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:48.987
So I think that we have a common-sense idea

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:51.634
that there is a kind of core 
or essence of ourselves

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:53.168
to be discovered.

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:56.424
And that this is kind of a permanent truth
about ourselves,

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:58.864
something that's the same throughout life.

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:02.615
Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.457
And I have to say now,
I'll say it a bit later,

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.285
but I'm not challenging this
just because I'm weird,

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:11.082
the challenge actually has a very,
very long and distinguished history.

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:13.251
Here's the common-sense idea.

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.287
There is you.

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:17.595
You are the individuals you are,
and you have this kind of core.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:22.227
Now in your life, what happens
is that you, of course,

00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:24.446
accumulate different experiences
and so forth.

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:26.716
So you have memories,

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:28.966
and these memories help 
to create what you are.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.623
You have desires, maybe for a cookie,

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.418
maybe for something
that we don't want to talk about

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:36.293
at 11 o'clock in the morning
in a school.

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:38.274
You will have beliefs.

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:40.187
This is a number plate
from someone in America.

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:42.959
I don't know whether this number plate,
which says "messiah 1,"

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.251
indicates that the driver
believes in the messiah,

00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:47.445
or that they are the messiah.

00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:50.158
Either way, they have beliefs 
about messiahs.

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:51.620
We have knowledge.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.878
We have sensations and experiences as well.

00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:56.395
It's not just intellectual things.

00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:58.998
So this is kind of 
the common-sense model, I think,

00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:00.150
of what a person is.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.441
There is a person who has all the things
that make up our life experiences.

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:08.960
But the suggestion 
I want to put to you today

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.395
is that there's something 
fundamentally wrong with this model.

00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:14.853
And I can show you what's wrong
with one click.

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:21.708
Which is there isn't actually a "you"
at the heart of all these experiences.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:23.321
Strange thought?
Well, maybe not.

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.079
What is there, then?

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.348
Well, clearly there are memories,
desires, intentions, sensations,

00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:30.291
and so forth.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:32.549
But what happens is
these things exist,

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.618
and they're kind of all integrated,

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:38.407
they're overlapped, they're connected
in various different ways.

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.997
They're connecting partly,
and perhaps even mainly,

00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:44.324
because they all belong to one body
and one brain.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.387
But there's also a narrative, 
a story we tell about ourselves,

00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:50.282
the experiences we have
when we remember past things.

00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:52.514
We do things because of other things.

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:56.126
So what we desire
is partly a result of what we believe,

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:59.692
and what we remember is also
informing us what we know.

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:02.354
And so really, there are all these things,

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:05.393
like beliefs, desires, 
sensations, experiences,

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.823
they're all related to each other,

00:04:07.823 --> 00:04:11.371
and that just is you.

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:16.208
In some ways, it's a small difference
from the common-sense understanding.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:18.462
In some ways, it's a massive one.

00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:20.638
It's the shift between thinking of yourself

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:24.034
as a thing which has 
all the experiences of life,

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:26.977
and thinking of yourself
as simply that collection

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:28.999
of all experiences in life.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.847
You are the sum of your parts.

00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:33.969
Now those parts are also physical parts, 
of course,

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.871
brains, bodies and legs and things,

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:38.174
but they aren't so important, actually.

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:40.847
If you have a heart transplant,
you're still the same person.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.227
If you have a memory transplant,
are you the same person?

00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:46.602
If you have a belief transplant, 
would you be the same person?

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:51.501
Now this idea, that what we are, 
the way to understand ourselves,

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:55.962
is as not of some permanent being,
which has experiences,

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.360
but is kind of a collection of experiences,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.971
might strike you as kind of weird.

00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:03.055
But actually, I don't think 
it should be weird.

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:04.914
In a way, it's common sense.

00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:09.215
Because I just invite you 
to think about, by comparison,

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:12.172
think about pretty much anything else
in the universe,

00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:14.922
maybe apart from the 
very most fundamental forces or powers.

00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:17.657
Let's take something like water.

00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:20.198
Now my science isn't very good.

00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:23.213
We might say something like 
water has two parts hydrogen

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:25.099
and one parts oxygen, right?

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.747
We all know that.

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:30.212
I hope no one in this room
thinks that what that means

00:05:30.212 --> 00:05:34.414
is there is a thing called water, 
and attached to it 

00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:37.051
are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,

00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.244
and that's what water is.

00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:39.099
Of course we don't.

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.351
We understand, very easily,
very straightforwardly,

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.083
that water is nothing more

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:49.117
than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules
suitably arranged.

00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:51.030
Everything else in the universe is the same.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.199
There's no mystery about my watch,
for example.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.562
We say the watch has a face, and hands,

00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:00.362
and a mechanism and a battery,

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:01.523
But what we really mean is,

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.128
we don't think 
there is a thing called the watch

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:05.861
to which we then attach all these bits.

00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:08.897
We understand very clearly 
that you get the parts of the watch,

00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:10.994
you put them together,
and you create a watch.

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:13.638
Now if everything else 
in the universe is like this,

00:06:13.638 --> 00:06:15.944
why are we different?

00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:17.508
Why think of ourselves

00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:21.460
as somehow not just being 
a collection of all our parts,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.328
but somehow being a separate,
permanent entity which has those parts?

00:06:26.328 --> 00:06:29.438
Now this view is not particularly new, 
actually.

00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:31.113
It has quite a long lineage.

00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:32.463
You find it in Buddhism,

00:06:32.463 --> 00:06:35.009
you find it in 17th, 
18th-century philosophy

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.604
going through to the current day,
people like Locke and Hume.

00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.687
But interestingly, it's also a view

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:44.731
increasingly being heard reinforced
by neuroscience.

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:48.375
This is Paul Broks, 
he's a clinical neuropsychologist,

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.574
and he says this:

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:51.956
"We have a deep intuition
that there is a core,

00:06:51.956 --> 00:06:54.505
an essence there, 
and it's hard to shake off,

00:06:54.505 --> 00:06:57.516
probably impossible to shake off, 
I suspect.

00:06:57.516 --> 00:07:01.443
But it's true that neuroscience shows
that there is no centre in the brain

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:03.733
where things do all come together."

00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:06.203
So when you look at the brain,

00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:10.220
and you look at how the brain
makes possible a sense of self,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.004
you find that there isn't 
a central control spot in the brain.

00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:17.303
There is no kind of center
where everything happens.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.888
There are lots of different processes
in the brain,

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:22.987
all of which operate, in a way,
quite independently.

00:07:22.987 --> 00:07:26.097
But it's because of the way 
that they relate

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.958
that we get this sense of self.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.447
The term I use in the book, 
I call it the ego trick.

00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:37.106
It's like a mechanical trick.

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.586
It's not that we don't exist,

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:42.870
it's just that the trick is 
to make us feel that inside of us

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.356
is something more unified
than is really there.

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:49.493
Now you might think
this is a worrying idea.

00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:51.825
You might think that if it's true,

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:55.576
that for each one of us there is
no abiding core of self,

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:57.561
no permanent essence,

00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.493
does that mean that really,
the self is an illusion?

00:08:01.493 --> 00:08:03.807
Does it mean that we really don't exist?

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:05.615
There is no real you.

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:08.696
Well, a lot of people actually do use 
this talk of illusion and so forth.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:12.674
These are three psychologists,
Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,

00:08:12.674 --> 00:08:14.978
Susan Blackmore,

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.963
a lot of these people do talk 
the language of illusion,

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:20.029
the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:23.075
But I don't think this is 
a very helpful way of looking at it.

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:23.852
Go back to the watch.

00:08:23.852 --> 00:08:27.904
The watch isn't an illusion, 
because there is nothing to the watch

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:30.152
other than a collection of its parts.

00:08:30.152 --> 00:08:32.109
In the same way, 
we're not illusions either.

00:08:32.109 --> 00:08:37.552
The fact that we are, in some ways,
just this very, very complex collection,

00:08:37.552 --> 00:08:39.137
ordered collection of things,

00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.012
does not mean we're not real.

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.911
I can give you 
a very sort of rough metaphor for this.

00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.516
Let's take something like a waterfall.

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:50.123
These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:52.625
Now if you take something like this,

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:55.919
you can appreciate the fact 
that in lots of ways,

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.029
there's nothing permanent about this.

00:08:58.029 --> 00:08:59.462
For one thing, it's always changing.

00:08:59.462 --> 00:09:02.309
The waters 
are always carving new channels.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:04.600
with changes and tides and the weather,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.024
some things dry up, 
new things are created.

00:09:09.024 --> 00:09:12.511
Of course the water that flows 
through the waterfall

00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.413
is different every single instance.

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:18.165
But it doesn't mean that 
the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:19.798
It doesn't mean it's not real.

00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:23.132
What it means is we have 
to understand what it is

00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:25.361
as something which has a history,

00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:28.003
has certain things that keep it together,

00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:30.799
but it's a process, it's fluid, 
it's forever changing.

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:34.531
Now that, I think, is a model
for understanding ourselves,

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.195
and I think it's a liberating model.

00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:39.231
Because if you think that you have
this fixed, permanent essence,

00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:42.237
which is always the same,
throughout your life, no matter what,

00:09:42.237 --> 00:09:44.807
in a sense you're kind of trapped.

00:09:44.807 --> 00:09:47.418
You're born with an essence,

00:09:47.418 --> 00:09:50.101
that's what you are until you die,

00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:53.130
if you believe in an afterlife, 
maybe you continue.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.100
But if you think of yourself
as being, in a way,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.880
not a thing as such, 
but a kind of a process,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.407
something that is changing,

00:10:01.407 --> 00:10:02.944
then I think that's quite liberating.

00:10:02.944 --> 00:10:05.812
Because unlike the the waterfalls,

00:10:05.812 --> 00:10:08.307
we actually have the capacity to channel

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:11.929
the direction of our development for ourselves
to a certain degree.

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:14.302
Now we've got to be careful here, right?

00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:17.392
If you watch the X-Factor too much,
you might buy into this idea

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:19.721
that we can all be whatever we want to be.

00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:21.039
That's not true.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:23.209
I've heard some fantastic musicians
this morning,

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:26.927
and I am very confident
that I could in no way be as good as them.

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.324
I could practice hard 
and maybe be good,

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:32.328
but I don't have
that really natural ability.

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:34.985
There are limits to what we can achieve.

00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:37.460
There are limits to what 
we can make of ourselves.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.122
But nevertheless, we do have 
this capacity

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:44.112
to, in a sense, shape ourselves.

00:10:44.112 --> 00:10:46.368
The true self, as it were then,

00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:50.429
is not something that is just there
for you to discover,

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:54.078
you don't sort of look into your soul
and find your true self,

00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:55.899
What you are partly doing, at least,

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:58.290
is actually creating your true self.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.213
And this, I think, is very,
very significant,

00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:02.179
particularly at this stage of life you're at.

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:03.578
You'll be aware of the fact

00:11:03.578 --> 00:11:06.132
how much of you changed over recent years.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.371
If you have any videos of yourself, 
three or four years ago,

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:12.651
you probably feel embarrassed 
because you don't recognize yourself.

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:15.532
So I want to get that message over,
that what we need to do

00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:18.592
is think about ourselves as things
that we can shape,

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:19.645
and channel and change.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:20.941
This is the Buddha, again:

00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:23.360
"Well-makers lead the water,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.761
fletchers bend the arrow,

00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:27.226
carpenters bend a log of wood,

00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:31.000
wise people fashion themselves."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.461
And that's the idea 
I want to leave you with,

00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:39.668
that your true self is not something 
that you will have to go searching for,

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:42.873
as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.

00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:44.574
To the extent you have a true self,

00:11:44.574 --> 00:11:47.308
it's something that you in part discover,

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.701
but in part create.

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:54.197
and that, I think, 
is a liberating and exciting prospect.

00:11:54.197 --> 00:11:56.313
Thank you very much.
