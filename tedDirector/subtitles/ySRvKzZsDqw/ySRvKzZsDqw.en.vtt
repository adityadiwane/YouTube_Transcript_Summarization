00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
that we think is going to change the way that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
That technology is simulating humans.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
It's simulated humans with a simulated body

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
and a simulated nervous system to control that body.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Now, before I talk more about that technology,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
at the moment in computer games.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
We already saw that briefly yesterday.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
It's one of the most successful games of all time.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.160
But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
They pretty much look the same.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And you can see he looks always the same.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
The reason for that is that these characters

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
are actually not real characters.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
They are a graphical visualization of a character.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
what's going to happen in the actual game,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
and then has to animate that particular sequence.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and then these particular animations are just played back

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
at appropriate times in the computer game.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
All you have is animations that are played back

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
at more or less the appropriate times.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
what you actually put into it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
There's no real emergence there.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
Now, the only way to get around that

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
is to actually simulate the human body

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
to show what the difference is --

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and that's because he has a physical body,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and because he has the motor skills to control that body.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
It's a very trivial thing.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
Torsten Reil: That's it, yes.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
So, that's what we're trying to simulate --

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and we tried to start very simply.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
that actually makes it work.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
that controls walking in humans.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
It's called the central pattern generator.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
is to teach that network how to walk.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
We heard about those already yesterday,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
But, just briefly, the concept is that

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
you create a large number of different individuals --

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
neural networks, in this case --

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
all of which are random at the beginning.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
of that two-legged creature here --

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
and hope that it does something interesting.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Most of them won't move at all,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
but some of them might make a tiny step.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Those are then selected by the algorithm,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And you repeat that process over and over again,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
until you have something that walks --

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
in this case, in a straight line, like this.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
So that was the idea behind this.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
like I've just demonstrated,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
and this is what I got instead.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:38.160
(Laughter)

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
So, it was back to the drawing board for us.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
We did get it to work eventually,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
after tweaking a bit here and there.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
At the beginning, it can't walk at all,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
but it will get better and better over time.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.160
(Laughter)

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.160
(Laughter)

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more --

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
still not quite there.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.160
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
That was the real breakthrough for us.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
It was, academically, quite a challenging project,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
that we could try and do other things as well with this approach --

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
actually simulating the body

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
for things like computer games or online worlds.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
What you see here is the character standing there,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
which is what I'm doing now, here,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
it will fall over it in a completely different way.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
(Laughter)

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Okay. That's the video. Thanks.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
because this is not something you get at the moment

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
in any interactive or any virtual worlds.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
What we really wanted was a full human body.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160
So we started the company.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
was to create the human body, basically.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
and tried to make it as realistic as possible.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
What you see here on the screen right now

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
is a very simple visualization of that body.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
so you can concentrate on the movement.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
Nothing really interesting, basically.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
It's going to stick out its hands.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
So that's what you see here.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Now, it gets really interesting

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160
if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
So here, we've got the same character.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
I'm going to push it a bit harder now,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
harder than I just pushed Chris.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
What you see is it takes steps backwards,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
it tries to counter-balance,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
I'll show you this again.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And then, finally hits the floor.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Now, this becomes really exciting

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.160
when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
That's something that you cannot do right now.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
First, starting with a push from the right.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
so you can see that the reaction is different.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
Again, a push, now this time from the front.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
And you see it falls differently.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
And now from the left --

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
and it falls differently.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
That was really exciting for us to see that.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
That was the first time we've seen that.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
This is the first time the public sees this as well,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
because we have been in stealth mode.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
I haven't shown this to anybody yet.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Now, just a fun thing:

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
what happens if you put that character --

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160
(Laughter)

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
And this is what happens.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
(Laughter)

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
(Applause)

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
It's nothing we had to do about this.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
We just took this character that I just talked about,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
Now, when we went to film studios and games developers

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
and showed them that technology, we got a very good response.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.160
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
That's what people want. That's what we're giving them.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.160
(Laughter)

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
You can see, it's always reacting.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
feels the force and tries to protect its head.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
You feel kind of sorry for that thing,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
and we've seen it so many times now that

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
we don't really care any more.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160
(Laughter)

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
Now, here's another one.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
a strong force applied to the character,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
and have the character react to it in midair.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
So that you don't have a character that looks limp,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
that looks kind of alive in midair as well.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
So this character is going to be hit by a force,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
it's going to realize it's in the air,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
and it's going to try and, well,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
That's one angle; here's another angle.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
We now think that the realism we're achieving with this

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
is good enough to be used in films.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
This is something I just got last night

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
from an animation studio in London, who are using our software

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
and experimenting with it right now.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
but in a slightly better rendered version.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
So if you look at the character carefully,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
you see there are lots of body movements going on,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
none of which you have to animate like in the old days.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
Animators had to actually animate them.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
This is all happening automatically in the simulation.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
This is a slightly different angle,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
and again a slow motion version of this.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
At the moment, doing something like this by hand

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
would take you probably a couple of days.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
This is another behavior they requested.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
In this case, the character's hands

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
are fixed to a particular point in space,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
And it looks organic. It looks realistic.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
You feel kind of sorry for the guy.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
if you render that a bit more realistically.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And this is all a physical simulation of the body,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
to create a slightly more complex stunt scene,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
Got a very short clip here.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
Yes, you can just about see it here.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
"Can we do that ourselves as well?"

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Can we use the physical simulation of the character,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
use artificial intelligence,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
put that artificial intelligence into the character,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
and then skydive afterwards,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
pretty much, to create the simulation.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
And that's what it looks like, here.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
just to see what we'd get out of it.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
But what we found over the past few months

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
is incredibly powerful.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160
There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
There's so many things we can do with this right now.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
for some major productions.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
The second thing is video games.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
that have real bodies that really react.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
Probably starting with sports games,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
which are going to become much more interactive.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160
But I particularly am really excited

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
about using this technology in online worlds,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160
The degree of interactivity you're going to get

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
We've been approached by several simulation companies,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.160
is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.160
to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
to predict the outcome of operations on these children.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
As you probably know,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
if you try and correct the gait.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
is what people think right now, is the outcome.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
and the surgeon can then work on that simulation

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
and try out different ways to improve that gait,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
before he actually commits to an actual surgery.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
That's one project we're particularly excited about,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
and that's going to start next month.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
Just finally, this is only just the beginning.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
We can only do several behaviors right now.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160
Right now, we don't have that

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
We do have one unintentional dancer actually,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
the last thing I'm going to show you.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
That's what we thought was going to come out of this.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
But this is what emerged out of it, in the end.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:27.160
(Music)

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
So, this was not something we actually put in there.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
He just started to create that dance himself.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
And what you see after a while --

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
And I think -- there you go.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
(Laughter)

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
So it's just --

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160
(Applause)

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Thanks.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.160
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160
so thanks very much for your time.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Thanks.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
(Applause)

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
CA: Incredible. That was really incredible.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160
TR: Thanks.
