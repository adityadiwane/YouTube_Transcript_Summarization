00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.816
A girl I've never met before

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.120
changed my life and the life
of thousands of other people.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.976
It's one of the largest organizations
in the world for young people.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.896
In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts
in the United States.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.456
And we're not homophobic.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.640
(Laughter)

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.616
And it's true -- the way we communicate
with young people is by text,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.000
because that's how
young people communicate.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.055
So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.776
things like collecting peanut butter
for food pantries,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.640
or making Valentine's Day cards
for senior citizens who are homebound.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.456
And we'll text them.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.416
And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.136
It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.136
We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.536
and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.336
This is big scale. OK --

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.040
(Applause)

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.280
But there's one weird side effect.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.936
Every time we send out a text message,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.256
we get back a few dozen text messages
having nothing to do with peanut butter

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.056
or hunger or senior citizens --

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.576
but text messages about being bullied,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.400
text messages about being addicted to pot.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.160
And the worst message
we ever got said exactly this:

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.200
"He won't stop raping me.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.240
It's my dad.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.840
He told me not to tell anyone.
Are you there?"

00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:52.096
We couldn't believe this was happening.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.776
We couldn't believe that something
so horrific could happen to a human being,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.440
and that she would share it with us --
something so intimate, so personal.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.736
And we realized
we had to stop triaging this

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.760
and we had to build a crisis text line
for these people in pain.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080
So we launched Crisis Text Line,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.456
very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso --
just a few thousand people in each market.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.216
And in four months,
we were in all 295 area codes in America.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.860
Just to put that into perspective,

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:26.496
that's zero marketing and faster growth
than when Facebook first launched.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.056
(Applause)

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.456
Text is unbelievably private.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.176
No one hears you talking.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.296
So we spike everyday at lunch time --

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.016
kids are sitting at the lunch table

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.216
and you think that she's texting
the cute boy across the hall,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.880
but she's actually texting us
about her bulimia.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.056
And we don't get the word "like"
or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840
We just get facts.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.816
We get things like, "I want to die.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.760
I have a bottle of pills
on the desk in front of me."

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.296
And so the crisis counselor says,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.320
"How about you put those pills
in the drawer while we text?"

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.136
And they go back and forth for a while.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And the crisis counselor
gets the girl to give her her address,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.896
because if you're texting
a text line, you want help.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.096
So she gets the address

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.296
and the counselor triggers
an active rescue

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320
while they're texting back and forth.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.216
And then it goes quiet --

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.880
23 minutes with no response
from this girl.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.616
And the next message that comes in says --

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.256
it's the mom --

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.856
"I had no idea, and I was in the house,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.360
we're in an ambulance
on our way to the hospital."

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.080
As a mom that one just --

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.880
The next message comes a month later.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.976
"I just got out of the hospital.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.520
I was diagnosed as bipolar,
and I think I'm going to be OK."

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.136
(Applause)

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.816
I would love to tell you
that that's an unusual exchange,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.376
but we're doing on average
2.41 active rescues a day.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.360
Thirty percent of our text messages
are about suicide and depression -- huge.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.936
The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.536
is that these are strangers
counseling other strangers

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.216
on the most intimate issues,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.616
and getting them from hot moments
to cold moments.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.936
It's exciting, and I will tell you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.216
that we have done a total
of more than 6.5 million text messages

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.536
in less than two years.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.536
(Applause)

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.776
But the thing that really gets me
hot and sweaty about this,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.656
the thing that really gets me
psyched is the data:

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.016
6.5 million messages --

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.680
that's the volume, velocity and variety
to provide a really juicy corpus.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.856
We can do things like predictive work.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.416
We can do all kinds of conclusions
and learnings from that data set.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.656
So we can be better,
and the world can be better.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.096
So how do we use the data
to make us better?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.456
Alright, chances are someone here,
someone watching this

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.056
has seen a therapist or a shrink
at some point in time in your life --

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.747
you do not have to raise your hand.

00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:11.376
(Laughter)

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.656
How do you know that person's any good?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.936
Oh, they have a degree
from Harvard on the wall?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.627
Are you sure he didn't graduate
in the bottom 10 percent?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.056
(Laughter)

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.296
When my husband and I
saw a marriage counselor,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.273
I thought she was a genius when she said,

00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:27.736
"I'll see you guys in two weeks --
but I need to see you next week, sir."

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.416
(Laughter)

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.360
We have the data to know
what makes a great counselor.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.656
We know that if you text
the words "numbs" and "sleeve,"

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.816
there's a 99 percent match for cutting.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.656
We know that if you text
in the words "mg" and "rubber band,"

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.960
there's a 99 percent match
for substance abuse.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.096
And we know that if you text in
"sex," "oral" and "Mormon,"

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.880
you're questioning if you're gay.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.656
Now that's interesting information
that a counselor could figure out

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.816
but that algorithm in our hands
means that an automatic pop-up says,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.216
"99 percent match for cutting --
try asking one of these questions"

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.576
to prompt the counselor.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.376
Or "99 percent match for substance abuse,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.040
here are three drug clinics
near the texter."

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.240
It makes us more accurate.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.976
On the day that Robin Williams
committed suicide,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.256
people flooded hotlines
all over this country.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.536
It was sad to see an icon,
a funnyman, commit suicide,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.256
and there were three hour wait times
on every phone hotline in the country.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.616
We had a spike in volume also.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.896
The difference was

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.856
if you text us, "I want to die,"
or "I want to kill myself,"

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.336
the algorithm reads that,
you're code orange,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.536
and you become number one in the queue.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.656
So we can handle severity,
not chronological.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.816
(Applause)

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.176
This data is also making the world better

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.696
because I'm sitting on the world's
first map of real-time crises.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.936
Think about it:

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.336
those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging
through natural language processes,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.856
all of these data points --

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.760
I can tell you that the worst day
of the week for eating disorders: Monday.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.920
The worst time of day
for substance abuse: 5am.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.336
And that Montana is
a beautiful place to visit

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.136
but you do not want to live there,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.720
because it is the number one state
for suicidal ideation.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.816
And we've made this data public
and free and open.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.936
We've pulled all the personally
identifiable information.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.216
And it's in a place
called CrisisTrends.org.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.576
Because I want schools to be able to see

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.936
that Monday is the worst day
for eating disorders,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.816
so that they can plan meals

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.256
and guidance counselors
to be there on Mondays.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.016
And I want families to see that
substance abuse questions spike at 5am.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.320
I want somebody to take care of those
Native American reservations in Montana.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.016
(Applause)

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.320
Data, evidence

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.056
makes policy, research,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.256
journalism, policing, school boards --
everything better.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.656
I don't think of myself
as a mental health activist.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.816
I think of myself
as a national health activist.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.720
I get really excited about this data,
I'm a little nerdy.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.136
Yeah, that sounded too girly.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.576
I'm nerdy.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.096
(Laughter)

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.080
I love data.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.816
And the only difference really between me
and those people in hoodies down the road

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.856
with their fat-funded companies,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.696
is that I'm not inspired by helping you
find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.736
or helping you touch your wrist
and get a car immediately,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.616
or swipe right and get laid.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.015
I'm inspired --

00:08:55.039 --> 00:09:00.816
(Laughter, applause)

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.416
I want to use tech and data
to make the world a better place.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.136
I want to use it to help that girl,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.440
who texted in about 
being raped by her father.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.296
Because the truth is
we never heard from her again.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.016
And I hope that she is
somewhere safe and healthy,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.296
and I hope that she sees this talk

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.936
and she knows that her desperation

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.896
and her courage inspired
the creation of Crisis Text Line

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.320
and inspires me every freaking day.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.760
(Applause)
