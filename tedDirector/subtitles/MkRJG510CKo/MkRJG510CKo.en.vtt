00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.518
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.370
and I have never had a patient tell me,

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.236
"I really want you
to be creative during surgery,"

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.379
and so I guess
there's a little bit of irony to it.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.703
I will say though that,
after having done surgery a lot,

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.937
it's similar to playing
a musical instrument.

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.791
And for me, this deep
and enduring fascination with sound

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:37.557
is what led me to both be a surgeon

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:40.115
and to study the science
of sound, particularly music.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.188
I'm going to talk
over the next few minutes

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:43.503
about my career

00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:45.811
in terms of how I'm able to study music

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:47.869
and try to grapple
with all these questions

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:50.236
of how the brain is able to be creative.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.890
I've done most of this work
at Johns Hopkins University,

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:55.899
and at the National Institute
of Health where I was previously.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:59.430
I'll go over some science experiments
and cover three musical experiments.

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.510
I will start off by playing
a video for you.

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:04.637
This video is of Keith Jarrett,
who's a well-known jazz improviser

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.105
and probably the most
well-known, iconic example

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.622
of someone who takes improvisation
to a higher level.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.785
And he'll improvise entire concerts
off the top of his head,

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:15.214
and he'll never play it
exactly the same way again,

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.223
so as a form of intense creativity,

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:18.865
I think this is a great example.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.236
And so why don't we go
and click the video.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
(Music)

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:19.056
(Music ends)

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.419
It's really a remarkable
thing that happens there.

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:23.171
I've always as a listener, as a fan,

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:24.912
I listen to that, and I'm astounded.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.672
I think -- how can this possibly be?

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.987
How can the brain generate
that much information,

00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:30.596
that much music, spontaneously?

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.236
And so I set out
with this concept, scientifically,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.611
that artistic creativity,
it's magical, but it's not magic,

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.642
meaning that it's a product of the brain.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:42.100
There's not too many brain-dead
people creating art.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:45.755
With this notion that artistic creativity
is in fact a neurologic product,

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.236
I took this thesis that we could study it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.374
just like we study any other
complex neurologic process,

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:53.453
and there are subquestions
that I put there.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.863
Is it possible to study
creativity scientifically?

00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:57.924
And I think that's a good question.

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:00.634
And I'll tell you that most
scientific studies of music,

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:02.176
they're very dense,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.595
and when you go through them,

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.689
it's very hard to recognize
the music in it.

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:07.932
In fact, they seem to be
unmusical entirely

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:09.750
and to miss the point of the music.

00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:11.330
This brings the second question:

00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:13.236
Why should scientists study creativity?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.339
Maybe we're not the right people to do it.

00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:16.362
(Laughter)

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:19.838
Well it may be, but I will say that,
from a scientific perspective,

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:21.880
we talked a lot about innovation today,

00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:23.236
the science of innovation,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.213
how much we understand
about how the brain is able to innovate

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:27.481
is in its infancy,

00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:30.972
and truly, we know very little
about how we are able to be creative.

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:32.520
I think that we're going to see,

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:34.236
over the next 10, 20, 30 years,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.431
a real science of creativity
that's burgeoning

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:37.656
and is going to flourish,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.112
Because we now have new methods
that can enable us

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.660
to take this process
like complex jazz improvisation,

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.058
and study it rigorously.

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:46.229
So it gets down to the brain.

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:48.047
All of us have this remarkable brain,

00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:50.526
which is poorly understood,
to say the least.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.748
I think that neuroscientists
have more questions than answers,

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.974
and I'm not going
to give you answers today,

00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:58.359
just ask a lot of questions.

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.890
And that's what I do in my lab.

00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:03.228
I ask questions about what is the brain
doing to enable us to do this.

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:06.029
This is the main method that I use.
This is functional MRI.

00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:08.776
If you've been in an MRI scanner,
it's very much the same,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.715
but this one is outfitted in a special way
to not just take pictures of your brain,

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.666
but to also take pictures
of active areas of the brain.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.595
The way that's done is by the following:

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.429
There's something called BOLD imaging,

00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:21.852
which is Blood Oxygen
Level Dependent imaging.

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.126
When you're in an fMRI scanner,
you're in a big magnet

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.523
that's aligning your molecules
in certain areas.

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:31.266
When an area of the brain is active,
meaning a neural area is active,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.528
it gets blood flow shunted to that area.

00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:37.902
That blood flow causes an increase
in local blood to that area

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:40.909
with a deoxyhemoglobin
change in concentration.

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:43.088
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,

00:04:43.112 --> 00:04:44.962
whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:46.940
So through this method of inference --

00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:49.506
and we're measuring blood flow,
not neural activity --

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.266
we say that an area of the brain
that's getting more blood

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.832
was active during a particular task,
and that's the crux of how fMRI works.

00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:59.761
And it's been used since the '90s
to study really complex processes.

00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:03.285
I'm going to review a study that I did,
which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:05.812
It was done with a colleague,
Alan Braun, at the NIH.

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:08.236
This is a short video
of how we did this project.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.041
(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic
MIDI piano keyboard

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:12.846
that we use for the jazz experiments.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.923
And it's a 35-key keyboard

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.407
designed to fit both inside the scanner,

00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:18.767
be magnetically safe,

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:22.633
have minimal interference
that would contribute to any artifact,

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.577
and have this cushion
so that it can rest on the players' legs

00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:28.556
while they're lying down in the scanner,
playing on their back.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.609
It works like this --
this doesn't actually produce any sound.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:34.076
It sends out what's called
a MIDI signal --

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.149
or a Musical Instrument
Digital Interface --

00:05:36.173 --> 00:05:38.834
through these wires into the box
and then the computer,

00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:41.793
which then trigger
high-quality piano samples like this.

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:45.058
(Music)

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:52.063
(Music)

00:06:07.593 --> 00:06:09.568
(Music ends)

00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:11.236
OK, so it works.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.236
And so through this piano keyboard,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.003
we have the means to take
a musical process and study it.

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.954
So what do you do now that you have
this cool piano keyboard?

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.423
You can't just say,
"It's great we have a keyboard."

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.771
We have to come up
with a scientific experiment.

00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:25.918
The experiment
really rests on the following:

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.833
What happens in the brain during something
that's memorized and over-learned,

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.012
and what happens in the brain
during something

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.310
that is spontaneously
generated, or improvised,

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:36.148
in a way that's matched motorically

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:39.017
and in terms of lower-level
sensory motor features?

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.636
I have here what we call the paradigms.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.156
There's a scale paradigm, which is playing
a scale up and down, memorized,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.914
then there's improvising on a scale,

00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:48.975
quarter notes, metronome, right hand --

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.570
scientifically very safe,

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.467
but musically really boring.

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.462
Then there's the bottom one,
which is called the jazz paradigm.

00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:57.890
So we brought professional
jazz players to the NIH,

00:06:57.914 --> 00:07:00.867
and we had them memorize
this piece of music on the lower-left,

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.709
which is what you heard me playing --

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:05.226
and we had them improvise
to the same chord changes.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.458
And if you can hit
that lower-right sound icon,

00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:10.310
that's an example
of what was recorded in the scanner.

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:14.064
(Music)

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:37.065
(Music ends)

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.505
In the end, it's not the most
natural environment,

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.435
but they're able to play real music.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.430
And I've listened to that solo 200 times,

00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:44.631
and I still like it.

00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:47.042
And the musicians
were comfortable in the end.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.890
We first measured the number of notes.

00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:51.571
Were they playing more notes
when they were improvising?

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:53.185
That was not what was going on.

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:55.194
And then we looked at the brain activity.

00:07:55.218 --> 00:07:57.026
I will try to condense this for you.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.530
These are contrast maps that are showing
subtractions between what changes

00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:03.650
when you're improvising
vs. when you're doing something memorized.

00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:06.459
In red is an area that's active
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:08:06.483 --> 00:08:07.942
the frontal lobe of the brain,

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.145
and in blue is this area
that was deactivated.

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:13.045
So we had this focal area
called the medial prefrontal cortex

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:14.456
that went way up in activity.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.710
We had this broad patch of area
called the lateral prefrontal cortex

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:19.259
that went way down in activity,

00:08:19.283 --> 00:08:20.771
I'll summarize that for you.

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:22.903
These are multifunctional
areas of the brain,

00:08:22.927 --> 00:08:25.082
these are not the jazz areas of the brain.

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:27.034
They do a whole host of things

00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:28.917
that have to do with self-reflection,

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.301
introspection, working memory etc.

00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.812
Really, consciousness is seated
in the frontal lobe.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:35.870
But we have this combination

00:08:35.894 --> 00:08:39.343
of an area that's thought to be involved
in self-monitoring, turning off,

00:08:39.367 --> 00:08:41.830
and this area that's thought
to be autobiographical,

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.389
or self-expressive, turning on.

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:45.484
We think, at least in this preliminary --

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:48.261
it's one study; it's probably wrong,
but it's one study --

00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:49.324
(Laughter)

00:08:49.348 --> 00:08:52.079
we think that at least
a reasonable hypothesis

00:08:52.103 --> 00:08:53.264
is that, to be creative,

00:08:53.288 --> 00:08:56.164
you should have this weird dissociation
in your frontal lobe.

00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:58.712
One area turns on,
and a big area shuts off,

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:01.674
so that you're not inhibited,
you're willing to make mistakes,

00:09:01.698 --> 00:09:03.866
so that you're not constantly
shutting down

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.815
all of these new generative impulses.

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:09.284
Now a lot of people know that music
is not always a solo activity --

00:09:09.308 --> 00:09:11.028
sometimes it's done communicatively.

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:12.236
The next question was:

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.832
What happens when musicians
are trading back and forth,

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:16.469
something called "trading fours,"

00:09:16.493 --> 00:09:19.316
which is something they do
normally in a jazz experiment.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.753
So this is a 12-bar blues,

00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:22.886
and I've broken it
down into four-bar groups,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.722
so you would know how you would trade.

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:27.032
We brought a musician
into the scanner, same way,

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:28.468
had them memorize this melody

00:09:28.492 --> 00:09:31.058
then had another musician
out in the control room

00:09:31.082 --> 00:09:33.051
trading back and forth interactively.

00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:35.699
So this is a musician, Mike Pope,

00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:38.809
one of the world's best bassists
and a fantastic piano player.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:45.092
(Music)

00:09:45.116 --> 00:09:47.482
He's now playing the piece
that we just saw

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:49.236
a little better than I wrote it.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.026
(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.820
Mike Pope: May the force be with you.

00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:54.610
Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?

00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:56.177
MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:08.615
CL: You have to have the right
attitude to agree to do it.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.895
(Laughter)

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.734
It's kind of fun, actually.

00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:13.357
(Music)

00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:15.080
Now we're playing back and forth.

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:17.316
He's in there.
You can see his legs up there.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.682
(Music)

00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:21.896
And then I'm in the control room here,
playing back and forth.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.920
(Music)

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.540
(Music ends)

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.604
(Video) Mike Pope:
This is a pretty good representation

00:10:36.628 --> 00:10:38.412
of what it's like.

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:40.436
And it's good that it's not too quick.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.039
The fact that we do it over and over again

00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:46.333
lets you acclimate to your surroundings.

00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:49.951
So the hardest thing for me
was the kinesthetic thing,

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:53.236
looking at my hands through two mirrors,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.236
laying on my back,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.938
and not able to move at all
except for my hand.

00:10:57.962 --> 00:10:59.834
That was challenging.

00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:01.008
But again --

00:11:02.212 --> 00:11:04.998
there were moments, for sure --

00:11:05.022 --> 00:11:06.023
(Laughter)

00:11:06.047 --> 00:11:10.410
there were moments of real, honest-to-God
musical interplay, for sure.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.048
CL: At this point,
I'll take a few moments.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.953
So what you're seeing here --

00:11:14.977 --> 00:11:17.054
and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,

00:11:17.078 --> 00:11:18.888
which is to show you preliminary data.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.665
This is one subject's data.

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:22.436
This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.936
So what am I showing you here?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.071
When he was trading fours with me,
improvising vs. memorized,

00:11:28.095 --> 00:11:30.844
his language areas lit up,
his Broca's area,

00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:32.930
in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.

00:11:32.954 --> 00:11:34.863
He had it also homologous on the right.

00:11:34.887 --> 00:11:38.046
This is an area thought to be
involved in expressive communication.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.198
This whole notion
that music is a language --

00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:42.521
maybe there's a neurologic
basis to it after all,

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:45.899
and we can see it when two musicians
are having a musical conversation.

00:11:45.923 --> 00:11:47.896
So we've done this on eight subjects now,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.849
and we're getting all the data together,

00:11:49.873 --> 00:11:52.698
hopefully we'll have something
to say about it meaningfully.

00:11:52.722 --> 00:11:55.965
Now when I think about improvisation
and the language, what's next?

00:11:55.989 --> 00:11:58.236
Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.007
I've always been fascinated by freestyle.

00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.544
And let's play this video.

00:12:02.568 --> 00:12:05.406
(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,
standing five-ten I be

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.452
Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.496
Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.854
Go and try to injure me,
broke 'em down chemically

00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:15.307
Ain't the number 10 MC,
talk about how been I be

00:12:15.331 --> 00:12:17.729
Styled it like Kennedy,
late like a 10 to three

00:12:17.753 --> 00:12:20.571
When I say when I be,
girls say bend that key cut

00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:22.413
CL: So there's a lot of analogy

00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:24.893
between what takes place
in freestyle rap and jazz.

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:27.834
There are a lot of correlates
between the two forms of music,

00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:30.305
I think, in different time periods,
in lot of ways,

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:33.160
rap serves the same social function
that jazz used to serve.

00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:35.077
So how do you study rap scientifically?

00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:38.236
And my colleagues think I'm crazy,
but I think it's very viable.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.487
This is what you do:

00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:42.258
You have a freestyle artist come
and memorize a rap

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:43.503
that you write for them,

00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:46.959
that they've never heard before,
and then you have them freestyle.

00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:49.401
So I told my lab members
that I would rap for TED,

00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:51.067
and they said, "No, you won't."

00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:52.294
And then I thought --

00:12:52.318 --> 00:12:53.634
(Laughter)

00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:59.384
(Applause)

00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:00.688
But here's the thing.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:03.613
With this big screen,
you can all rap with me. OK?

00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:05.481
So what we had them do

00:13:05.505 --> 00:13:08.101
was memorize this lower-left
sound icon, please.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:11.018
This is the control condition.
This is what they memorized.

All of these words keep
pouring out like rain

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.995
I need a mad scientist to check my brain

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:46.326

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:53.350

that will never happen again.

00:13:57.728 --> 00:13:59.669

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:01.881
So now, what's great
about these free-stylers,

00:14:01.905 --> 00:14:03.767
they will get cued different words.

00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:05.235
They don't know what's coming,

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.175
but they'll hear something off the cuff.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:08.608
Go hit that right sound icon,

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.352

so what do we see in his brain?

but then, eyes closed --

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.573
when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,

00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:43.751
you've got major visual areas lighting up.

00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:47.464
You've got major cerebellar activity,
which is involved in motor coordination.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.844
You have heightened brain activity
when you're doing a comparable task,

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:53.826
when that one task is creative
and the other task is memorized.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.634
It's very preliminary,
but I think it's kind of cool.

00:15:56.658 --> 00:15:58.966
To conclude, we've got
a lot of questions to ask,

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.895
and like I said, we'll ask questions
here, not answer them.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:05.370
But we want to get at the root
of what is creative genius neurologically,

00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:07.951
and I think, with these methods,
we're getting close.

00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:10.278
And I think, hopefully
in the next 10, 20 years,

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.199
you'll see real, meaningful studies

00:16:12.223 --> 00:16:15.236
that say science has to catch up to art,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.648
