00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.330
is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.330
what's going on with no difficulty at all.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
but would miss the point.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
(Laughter)

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
He would have a great time.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.330
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.330
a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
he had a secret weapon yesterday,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
literally, in his sword swallowing act.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.330
but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
so we're actually looking forward to it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.330
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
And our friend, Betty Edwards,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.330
to her drawing class and says,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
"The problem you have with learning to draw

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
is not that you can't move your hand,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.330
but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
It's trying to perceive images into objects

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
rather than seeing what's there."

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.330
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
She does this with cardboard, but since I have

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
an expensive computer here

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.330
that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
They measure very, very carefully.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
you'll see that those two shapes are

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
exactly the same size.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
who had that insight back then,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.330
then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
happening inside here. It's a waking dream,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.330
is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
And what that means: "simple and understandable"

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
might not be actually simple or understandable,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.330
and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
until we admit we're blind.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
Once you start down at this very humble level,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
then you can start finding ways to see things.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
little additional parts for our brain --

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
made out of powerful ideas that help us

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
see the world in different ways.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.330
telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.330
in the ability to change perspective on things.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.330
I'll talk about that a little bit.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
It's this change in perspective

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
on what it is we think we're perceiving

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.330
that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
than we have in the rest of human history.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
is when we do more. We like more.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
the simplicity gets complex

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
another name for them could be "architecture"

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
as a metaphor for taking the same old material

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.330
and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
of having the descriptions

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
at various levels be rather similar --

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.330
all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
are both sticky and standoffish,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and they're in violent motion.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Those three things give rise to all the different levels

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
of what seem to be complexity in our world.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
But how simple?

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.330
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.330
in conveying complex ideas simply.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.330
And I put some effort in to try and check

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.330
to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.330
actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
and I found that they matched up very well.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.330
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.330
without removing what's important about the data.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
Whereas the film yesterday that we saw

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
of the simulation of the inside of a cell,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.330
as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.330
but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
about molecular biology, and that is:

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.330
why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
finding each other just the right way

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
so they combine together and be catalyzed?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
And what we saw yesterday was

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
every reaction was fortuitous;

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.330
they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
about a million revolutions per second;

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.330
they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
they're completely crowded together, they're jammed,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
they're bashing up against each other.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330
what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
and I think that's exactly the wrong image

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
for when you're trying to teach science.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.330
So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.330
with the actual understanding of some principle.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
So a kid who's 14 in high school

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:36.330
gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
which is a truly subtle and interesting proof,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:46.330
but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.330
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.330
is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.330
so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
three more triangles and we copy that,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.330
notice that we can move those triangles down like this.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:19.330
and bingo. That is all you have to do.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
in order to get an idea of what it means

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.330
before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
Now let's go to young children.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
This is a very unusual teacher

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
but was a natural mathematician.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.330
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
but is a terrific musician;

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
she just had a feeling for math.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
And here are her six-year-olds,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.330
and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
And what this teacher did on every project

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
and then something like science.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
So they had created these artifacts.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.330
which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
to slow them down so they'll think.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and pasting them up.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.330
But the whole point of this thing is

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
for them to look at this chart and fill it out.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.330
"What have you noticed about what you did?"

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.330
and the second one took three more

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
and the total was four on that one,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.330
and then the next one.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:18.330
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
around the edges was always going to grow by two,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:30.330
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
where she wasn't sure what six times six was

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
and what seven times seven was,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
but then she was confident again.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
So that's what Lauren did.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:55.330
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.330
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
will recognize these two progressions

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
as a first-order discrete differential equation

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.330
and a second-order discrete differential equation,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.330
derived by six-year-olds.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.330
Well, that's pretty amazing.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:27.330
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And so the first idea here is

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.330
just to show you the kind of things that children do.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.330
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:46.330
So I'd like to draw a little car here --

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:53.330
I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.330
I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
Each time I click it, car turn.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.330
I just drag these guys out and set them going.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And I can try steering the car here by ...

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
See the car turn by five here?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
So what if I click this down to zero?

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.330
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Make it go in the other direction.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
as far as driving a car,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
so the kids want to do a steering wheel;

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
so they draw a steering wheel.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And we'll call this a wheel.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
See this wheel's heading here?

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.330
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
those numbers coming out there

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
and to just drop it into the script here,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.330
and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
And it's interesting.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
You know how much trouble the children have with variables,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
they never forget from this single trial

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
what a variable is and how to use it.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
So if you look at the little script here,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
the speed is always going to be 30.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.330
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.330
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.330
of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.330
What do I get there?"

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:05.330
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
So how do the children do science?

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Student 1: Ooh, this is nice.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
Teacher: Do not pay any attention

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
to what anybody else is doing.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
Who's got the apple?

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
Student 3: 0.99 seconds.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
Teacher: So put "sponge ball" ...

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.330
because they're two totally different weights,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
and if you drop them at the same time,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
maybe they'll drop at the same speed.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.330
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
about this particular point

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And it was not until Galileo actually did it

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
that an adult thought like a child,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
only 400 years ago.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.330
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.330
who will actually cut straight to the chase.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.330
Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.330
We can take a movie of what's going on,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.330
but even if we single stepped this movie,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
it's tricky to see what's going on.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
or stack them up.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.330
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:04.330
and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:10.330
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.330
to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.330
like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:27.330
and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
in the speed is constant.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.330
We've done that already."

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:42.330
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:47.330
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.330
we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.330
Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.330
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.330
this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
but it's a great story.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
And I thought I would do just one thing

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:31.330
on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.330
So once you have gravity, here's this --

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.330
increase the speed by something,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.330
increase the ship's speed.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.330
If I start the little game here that the kids have done,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.330
it'll crash the space ship.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.330
But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.330
(Laughter)

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.330
One more.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.330
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:06.330
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.330
Marshall McLuhan said,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.330
"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
but in fact, if you think of it,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
children are the future we send to the future.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.330
Forget about messages;

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.330
children are the future,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.330
and children in the first and second world

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.330
and, most especially, in the third world

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.330
need mentors.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.330
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.330
and maybe 50 million next year.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:43.330
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:49.330
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.330
but the mentoring that is required to go

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:57.330
from a simple new iChat instant messaging system

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.330
to something with depth is missing.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.330
and this new kind of user interface could be done

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.330
with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:18.330
It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:23.330
we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.330
so this is actually cheap.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.330
And Einstein said,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.330
"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.330
Thank you.
