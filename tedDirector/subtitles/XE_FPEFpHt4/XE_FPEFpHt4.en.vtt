00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:18.118
I've always written primarily about architecture,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.643
about buildings, and writing about architecture

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:23.384
is based on certain assumptions.

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.842
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.322
or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.596
a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.993
of politics and culture and economics that shapes

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:36.996
these places, at the end of the day, you can go

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.652
and you can visit them. You can walk around them.

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:41.325
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:44.818
You can experience their sense of place.

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:47.167
But what was striking to me over the last several years

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:50.542
was that less and less was I going out into the world,

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:53.771
and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:58.091
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.967
I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.064
but I was also getting up at the end of the day

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:05.364
and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.223
And what was surprising to me was how quickly

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:11.160
my relationship to the physical world had changed.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.935
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:16.391
call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.350
you know, four or five years of being online all the time,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.524
our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:24.323
our attention is constantly divided. You know,

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.887
we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.719
out in the world around us.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.246
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:34.248
got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen

00:01:34.248 --> 00:01:38.037
seemed to have no physical reality of its own.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:40.805
If you went and looked for images of the Internet,

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:43.923
this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:47.053
of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse

00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:49.149
where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.573
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:55.190
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.920
the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.617
I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:04.302
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.

00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:07.667
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.524
the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them

00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:13.505
together in the same place.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.712
And then this happened.

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:19.310
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.044
and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:24.171
the dusty clump of cables behind the couch,

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:27.381
and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.257
and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.

00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:32.811
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:35.602
and he said, "There's your problem.

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:40.023
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)

00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:43.150
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.524
a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:49.979
everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.608
It was unequivocally not something

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:55.919
a squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.797
But that in fact seemed to be the case.

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:00.999
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.186
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:05.366
if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:06.970
to follow it. Where would it go?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.478
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:11.827
Could I go there? Who would I meet?

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:15.203
You know, was there something actually out there?

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:18.240
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.020
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.450
as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.009
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.091
because that's where you get the best reception,

00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.396
but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.568
for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:39.942
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:42.808
for a short while, and she looks at it and she says,

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:46.198
"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:50.158
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:52.475
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:54.771
that only fools seem to look for.

00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:57.606
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:59.852
black box with a blinking red light on it.

00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:02.180
It wasn't a real world out there.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.492
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:07.258
and that's what I spent about two years visiting,

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:10.803
these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:13.448
that use as much power as the cities in which they sit,

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:16.637
and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,

00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:18.345
which is one of the buildings in the world,

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.243
one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,

00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:23.887
where more networks of the Internet connect to each other

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:25.245
than anywhere else.

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:27.862
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:30.347
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:33.289
a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.720
connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.414
the ceiling and down into the router of another network,

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:42.791
and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.084
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,

00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:48.410
has 10 times more networks connecting within it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.258
than the next tier of buildings.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:52.326
There's a very short list of these places.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.234
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home

00:04:55.234 --> 00:04:57.823
to about a half a dozen very important networks,

00:04:57.823 --> 00:05:00.121
which are the networks which serve the undersea cables

00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:02.469
that travel underneath the ocean

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.722
that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:08.309
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.169
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:14.625
in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.730
the ocean, cables like this.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.616
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:22.558
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:26.621
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,

00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:28.261
as expansive as you can imagine.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.816
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.427
or eight thousand miles in length, and

00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:36.036
if the material science and the computational technology

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:39.569
is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.349
is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.634
and comes out on the other, and it usually comes

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:49.267
from a building called a landing station that's often

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:52.214
tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,

00:05:52.214 --> 00:05:54.948
and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor

00:05:54.948 --> 00:05:57.468
that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles

00:05:57.468 --> 00:06:01.125
they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:04.331
is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.829
wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:10.013
connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,

00:06:10.013 --> 00:06:13.291
but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:16.248
through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe

00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:19.267
50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:22.135
through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:24.737
eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.

00:06:24.737 --> 00:06:28.227
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.

00:06:28.227 --> 00:06:30.056
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.394
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,

00:06:32.394 --> 00:06:35.483
this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.

00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:39.973
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:42.954
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:44.850
when I started thinking about this, there was one cable

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.017
down the Western coast of Africa, represented

00:06:48.017 --> 00:06:50.891
in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.

00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:55.736
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.

00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:58.367
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.167
they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.983
an industry around it, they need to know that their connection

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:05.693
isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.760
you have to send a ship out into the water, throw

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.675
a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,

00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:13.718
and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.

00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:18.258
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.

00:07:18.258 --> 00:07:22.556
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:25.228
worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:28.226
of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:31.208
And I've never met him. We've only communicated

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:34.665
via this telepresence system, which always makes me

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:38.561
think of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)

00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:41.758
And he is English. The undersea cable industry

00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:45.403
is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:48.578
(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time

00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:51.078
with the boom about 20 years ago.

00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:54.338
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business

00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:56.803
when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic

00:07:56.803 --> 00:07:59.963
and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces

00:07:59.963 --> 00:08:03.507
onto them, until they had built a belt around the world,

00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:05.604
which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.

00:08:05.604 --> 00:08:07.827
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world,

00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:10.038
and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around

00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:13.223
the other direction. And then having done that,

00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:17.167
they started to look for places to wire next.

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.657
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant

00:08:19.657 --> 00:08:22.451
North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:26.222
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.

00:08:26.222 --> 00:08:29.181
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.

00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:32.494
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see

00:08:32.494 --> 00:08:35.346
one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:37.666
online we experience these fleeting moments of connection,

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:40.960
these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.800
or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.876
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:49.223
was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.

00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:51.508
And Simon was working on a new cable,

00:08:51.508 --> 00:08:54.019
WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:56.140
from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.009
to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.342
And he said there was coming soon, depending

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.536
on the weather, but he'd let me know when,

00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:06.737
and so with about four days notice, he said to go

00:09:06.737 --> 00:09:09.568
to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:13.264
this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)

00:09:13.264 --> 00:09:17.584
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,

00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:20.297
called a messenger line, and that was the first link

00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:22.850
between sea and land, this link that would then be

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.713
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.

00:09:26.713 --> 00:09:29.303
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:32.660
specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.408
on these buoys until it was in the right place.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.150
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.963
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:44.322
in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,

00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.621
and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable

00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.526
dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:50.399
to the ship, and when he got there,

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.812
they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,

00:09:52.812 --> 00:09:55.231
and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,

00:09:55.231 --> 00:10:02.391
and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)

00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:05.103
And then once that cable was on shore,

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:08.607
they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:11.564
for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.

00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:14.422
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start

00:10:14.422 --> 00:10:17.358
sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a --

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:19.420
sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.128
like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up

00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:23.805
with the cable that had come down,

00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:26.796
and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:30.127
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:32.770
you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.707
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.

00:10:36.707 --> 00:10:39.215
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:42.062
is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much

00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:44.967
as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process

00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:48.734
itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.723
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer

00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:53.898
giving directions in the background. And more importantly,

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:56.541
the places are the same. These cables still connect

00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:59.591
these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,

00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:02.750
Mumbai, Singapore, New York.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.836
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days,

00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:11.027
and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover

00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:13.998
back on top, and they push the sand over that,

00:11:13.998 --> 00:11:17.080
and we all forget about it.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.331
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,

00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:21.241
but every time we put something on the cloud,

00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.443
we give up some responsibility for it.

00:11:23.443 --> 00:11:27.307
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.

00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:28.590
And that doesn't seem right.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.932
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says

00:11:30.932 --> 00:11:35.329
that wired people should know something about wires.

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.599
And we should know, I think, we should know

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:40.352
where our Internet comes from, and we should know

00:11:40.352 --> 00:11:45.174
what it is that physically, physically connects us all.

00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:47.513
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:47.513 --> 00:11:49.910
(Applause)

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.520
Thanks. (Applause)
