00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.582
So when I was eight years old,

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.740
a new girl came to join the class,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.773
and she was so impressive,

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:23.055
as the new girl always seems to be.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.733
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.773
and a cute little pencil case,

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:32.361
super strong on state capitals,

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:34.853
just a great speller.

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:39.803
And I just curdled with jealousy that year,

00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:43.346
until I hatched my devious plan.

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:47.579
So one day I stayed a little late after school,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.659
a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.994
When the coast was clear, I emerged,

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:55.733
crept into the classroom,

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.590
and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.926
And then I did it.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:04.293
I fiddled with my rival's grades,

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:07.123
just a little, just demoted some of those A's.

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:10.222
All of those A's. (Laughter)

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:13.965
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.999
when hang on, some of my other classmates

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.492
had appallingly good grades too.

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:22.540
So, in a frenzy,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.528
I corrected everybody's marks,

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:26.437
not imaginatively.

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:28.951
I gave everybody a row of D's

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.752
and I gave myself a row of A's,

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:34.552
just because I was there, you know, might as well.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:40.162
And I am still baffled by my behavior.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.574
I don't understand where the idea came from.

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:45.903
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:47.426
I felt great.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.005
I don't understand why I was never caught.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.601
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.914
I was never caught.

00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:55.435
But most of all, I am baffled by,

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:56.942
why did it bother me so much

00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:58.886
that this little girl, this tiny little girl,

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.600
was so good at spelling?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.710
Jealousy baffles me.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.634
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:08.100
We know babies suffer from jealousy.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.750
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.270
We know that jealousy is the number one cause

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.186
of spousal murder in the United States.

00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:21.290
And yet, I have never read a study

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.205
that can parse to me its loneliness

00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:29.059
or its longevity or its grim thrill.

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.906
For that, we have to go to fiction,

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:34.246
because the novel is the lab

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:35.820
that has studied jealousy

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.894
in every possible configuration.

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:41.218
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:43.250
that if we didn't have jealousy,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.800
would we even have literature?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.390
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.228
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."

00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:55.365
No Shakespeare.

00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:57.555
There goes high school reading lists,

00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.367
because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:01.616
we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:05.743
we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."

00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:08.150
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.911
I know it's fashionable to say that Proust

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.518
has the answers to everything,

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:14.224
but in the case of jealousy,

00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.965
he kind of does.

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.951
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.952
and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:27.104
and just regular competitiveness, my brand,

00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:29.689
that we can hope to have. (Laughter)

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.116
And we think about Proust, we think

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.610
about the sentimental bits, right?

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.565
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.746
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:41.772
We forget how harsh his vision was.

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:43.612
We forget how pitiless he is.

00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:45.933
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.269
were tough as cat gut.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.317
I don't know what cat gut is,

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:53.218
but let's assume it's formidable.

00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:56.436
Let's look at why they go so well together,

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:00.114
the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:03.345
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:06.728
which boils down into person, desire, impediment,

00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:11.396
is such a solid narrative foundation?

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:14.071
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,

00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:16.120
because let's think about what happens

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.898
when we feel jealous.

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:21.850
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.133
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.807
and these stories make us feel terrible

00:04:28.807 --> 00:04:31.030
because they're designed to make us feel terrible.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.564
As the teller of the tale and the audience,

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.538
we know just what details to include,

00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:39.107
to dig that knife in. Right?

00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:42.462
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,

00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:44.478
and this is something Proust understood.

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:47.651
In the first volume, Swann's Way,

00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:49.475
the series of books,

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:51.181
Swann, one of the main characters,

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:54.409
is thinking very fondly of his mistress

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.101
and how great she is in bed,

00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:59.143
and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,

00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:01.184
and these are Proustian sentences,

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:02.696
so they're long as rivers,

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.959
but in the course of a few sentences,

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.366
he suddenly recoils and he realizes,

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:10.649
"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:14.420
somebody else would love about this woman.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.511
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.220
could be giving somebody else pleasure,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.498
maybe right about now."

00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:24.282
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.145
and from then on, Proust writes that

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:29.192
every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:31.856
he adds to his "collection of instruments

00:05:31.856 --> 00:05:35.478
in his private torture chamber."

00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:37.753
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,

00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.429
were notoriously jealous.

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:41.133
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:43.737
the country if they wanted to break up with him.

00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:46.640
But you don't have to be that jealous

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.551
to concede that it's hard work. Right?

00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:51.160
Jealousy is exhausting.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.807
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.

00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:56.896
And what does jealousy like?

00:05:56.896 --> 00:05:59.986
Jealousy likes information.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:02.375
Jealousy likes details.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.198
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.664
the cute little pencil case.

00:06:07.664 --> 00:06:09.206
Jealousy likes photos.

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:12.936
That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)

00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:16.897
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:19.339
When Swann is in his jealous throes,

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.510
and suddenly he's listening at doorways

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.533
and bribing his mistress' servants,

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:24.985
he defends these behaviors.

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:27.402
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,

00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:29.208
but it is no different

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.558
from interpreting an ancient text

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.225
or looking at a monument."

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.822
He says, "They are scientific investigations

00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:38.825
with real intellectual value."

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.937
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy

00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:43.828
feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,

00:06:43.828 --> 00:06:48.498
but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,

00:06:48.498 --> 00:06:51.899
a quest for truth, painful truth,

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.828
and actually, where Proust is concerned,

00:06:53.828 --> 00:06:56.620
the more painful the truth, the better.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.357
Grief, humiliation, loss:

00:07:01.357 --> 00:07:04.313
These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.

00:07:04.313 --> 00:07:08.215
He says, "A woman whom we need,

00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:11.001
who makes us suffer, elicits from us

00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.506
a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital

00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:18.945
than a man of genius who interests us."

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:21.820
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.117
No. I think he's trying to say

00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:27.286
that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.

00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:30.182
And does any other emotion crack us open

00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:32.510
in this particular way?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.590
Does any other emotion reveal to us

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.923
our aggression and our hideous ambition

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:40.322
and our entitlement?

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:42.972
Does any other emotion teach us to look

00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:46.164
with such peculiar intensity?

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:48.316
Freud would write about this later.

00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:50.570
One day, Freud was visited

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.892
by this very anxious young man who was consumed

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.395
with the thought of his wife cheating on him.

00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:57.472
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,

00:07:57.472 --> 00:07:59.586
because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.

00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:01.557
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.

00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:02.887
The poor creature is just

00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:04.885
under suspicion for no cause.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.694
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing

00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:10.194
without noticing, unintentional behaviors.

00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.511
Is she smiling too brightly here,

00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:15.851
or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.527
[Freud] says that the man is becoming

00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:22.875
the custodian of his wife's unconscious.

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.696
The novel is very good on this point.

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:27.504
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy

00:08:27.504 --> 00:08:31.488
trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:35.563
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,

00:08:35.563 --> 00:08:38.082
the more we become residents of fantasy.

00:08:38.082 --> 00:08:41.002
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:43.818
just provoke us to do violent things

00:08:43.818 --> 00:08:45.818
or illegal things.

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:48.100
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.458
that are wildly inventive.

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:52.901
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,

00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.920
but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.828
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught

00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:03.697
creating a fake Facebook account

00:09:03.697 --> 00:09:07.420
from which she sent vile, hideous messages

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.645
to herself for a year.

00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:13.770
For a year. A year.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.645
And she was trying to frame

00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:17.802
her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,

00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:21.443
and I have to confess when I heard this,

00:09:21.443 --> 00:09:23.355
I just reacted with admiration.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.932
(Laughter)

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:27.347
Because, I mean, let's be real.

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:31.664
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?

00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:34.084
This is something from a novel.

00:09:34.084 --> 00:09:37.485
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.655
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:43.707
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.

00:09:43.707 --> 00:09:45.900
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train"

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.948
and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"

00:09:47.948 --> 00:09:51.013
books that are all about how jealousy,

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:52.888
it muddles our minds,

00:09:52.888 --> 00:09:55.882
and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,

00:09:55.882 --> 00:10:01.145
the membrane between what is and what could be

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:04.038
can be pierced in an instant.

00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:06.486
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.

00:10:06.486 --> 00:10:09.325
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:11.501
or wanting what you have

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:14.929
to being you and having what you once had,

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:16.462
and you're under the floorboards,

00:10:16.462 --> 00:10:17.825
he's answering to your name,

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:19.517
he's wearing your rings,

00:10:19.517 --> 00:10:21.518
emptying your bank account.

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:23.493
That's one way to go.

00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:27.157
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.

00:10:27.157 --> 00:10:29.194
I can't give the world D's,

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:32.041
as much as I would really like to, some days.

00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.539
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:38.446
We live in jealous times.

00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:40.459
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:43.843
aren't we, where the currency is envy?

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:48.312
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.

00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:51.753
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,

00:10:51.753 --> 00:10:53.929
when they are in possession of a mystery.

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:56.203
Let's go to 221B Baker Street

00:10:56.203 --> 00:10:58.221
and ask for Sherlock Holmes.

00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:00.690
When people think of Holmes,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.799
they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:06.006
right, this criminal mastermind.

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:08.469
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:11.374
who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard

00:11:11.374 --> 00:11:13.104
who needs Holmes desperately,

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:15.408
needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.265
Oh, it's so familiar to me.

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:21.282
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:24.593
and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.

00:11:24.593 --> 00:11:28.470
But as they work together, something starts to change,

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.513
and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"

00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:35.443
once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,

00:11:35.443 --> 00:11:38.884
Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,

00:11:38.884 --> 00:11:43.165
"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.

00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:46.524
We're proud of you."

00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:48.853
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard

00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:51.852
who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.

00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:54.237
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved

00:11:54.237 --> 00:11:56.332
in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:59.396
this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?

00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:01.309
It seems to treat jealousy

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:04.047
as a problem of geometry, not emotion.

00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:06.913
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:08.836
The next minute they're on the same side.

00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:10.983
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself

00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:13.950
admire this mind that he's resented.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.879
Could it be so simple though?

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.310
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.020
just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.350
in relation to another?

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.221
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent

00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:28.282
somebody's excellence.

00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:31.656
We could align ourselves with it.

00:12:31.656 --> 00:12:33.912
But I like contingency plans.

00:12:33.912 --> 00:12:36.248
So while we wait for that to happen,

00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:38.944
let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.

00:12:38.944 --> 00:12:41.395
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:43.478
Fiction alone domesticates it,

00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:45.356
invites it to the table.

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.229
And look who it gathers:

00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:51.065
sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,

00:12:51.065 --> 00:12:55.534
crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.

00:12:55.534 --> 00:12:57.948
We are in excellent company.

00:12:57.948 --> 00:12:59.368
Thank you.

00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:04.184
(Applause)
