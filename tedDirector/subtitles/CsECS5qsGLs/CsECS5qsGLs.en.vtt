00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:17.793
This is a painting from the 16th century
from Lucas Cranach the Elder.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.926
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:27.034
If you drink its water or you bathe in it,
you will get health and youth.

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:33.406
Every culture, every civilization
has dreamed of finding eternal youth.

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:38.796
There are people like Alexander the Great
or Ponce De LeÃ³n, the explorer,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.251
who spent much of their life
chasing the Fountain of Youth.

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:43.894
They didn't find it.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.050
But what if there was something to it?

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:50.773
What if there was something
to this Fountain of Youth?

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:56.462
I will share an absolutely amazing
development in aging research

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.096
that could revolutionize
the way we think about aging

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.322
and how we may treat age-related
diseases in the future.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.654
It started with experiments that showed,

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:09.972
in a recent number
of studies about growing,

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:15.997
that animals -- old mice --
that share a blood supply with young mice

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.625
can get rejuvenated.

00:01:18.148 --> 00:01:22.757
This is similar to what you might see
in humans, in Siamese twins,

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:24.869
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.

00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:31.285
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
researcher, reported in 2007,

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:34.809
was that old muscle from a mouse
can be rejuvenated

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.462
if it's exposed to young blood
through common circulation.

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:44.546
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.165
and others then showed that similar
rejuvenating effects could be observed

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.975
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:57.071
But what I'm most excited about,
and several other labs as well,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.514
is that this may even apply to the brain.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:06.046
So, what we found is that an old mouse
exposed to a young environment

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.083
in this model called parabiosis,

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:10.899
shows a younger brain --

00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:13.105
and a brain that functions better.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.556
And I repeat:

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.793
an old mouse that gets young blood
through shared circulation

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:24.801
looks younger and functions
younger in its brain.

00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:27.530
So when we get older --

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:30.226
we can look at different aspects
of human cognition,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.003
and you can see on this slide here,

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.410
we can look at reasoning,
verbal ability and so forth.

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:41.178
And up to around age 50 or 60,
these functions are all intact,

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:45.684
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:46.716
(Laughter)

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.547
But it's scary to see
how all these curves go south.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.160
And as we get older,

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:56.235
diseases such as Alzheimer's
and others may develop.

00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.575
We know that with age,
the connections between neurons --

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.250
the way neurons talk to each other,
the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:08.580
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:12.596
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.

00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:18.482
One big problem we have -- to try
to understand how this really works

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:21.102
at a very molecular mechanistic level --

00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:25.176
is that we can't study the brains
in detail, in living people.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.019
We can do cognitive tests,
we can do imaging --

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:31.739
all kinds of sophisticated testing.

00:03:31.763 --> 00:03:35.381
But we usually have to wait
until the person dies

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:40.499
to get the brain and look at how it really
changed through age or in a disease.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.952
This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:50.000
So, how about we think of the brain
as being part of the larger organism.

00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:52.501
Could we potentially understand more

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.454
about what happens in the brain
at the molecular level

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:59.064
if we see the brain
as part of the entire body?

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:03.965
So if the body ages or gets sick,
does that affect the brain?

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.412
And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
does that influence the rest of the body?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.541
And what connects all the different
tissues in the body

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:13.715
is blood.

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:20.191
Blood is the tissue that not only carries
cells that transport oxygen, for example,

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:21.456
the red blood cells,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.680
or fights infectious diseases,

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:27.975
but it also carries messenger molecules,

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.911
hormone-like factors
that transport information

00:04:31.935 --> 00:04:36.068
from one cell to another,
from one tissue to another,

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:37.549
including the brain.

00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:42.711
So if we look at how the blood
changes in disease or age,

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:45.098
can we learn something about the brain?

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:50.487
We know that as we get older,
the blood changes as well,

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.470
so these hormone-like factors
change as we get older.

00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:57.693
And by and large,
factors that we know are required

00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:01.138
for the development of tissues,
for the maintenance of tissues --

00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:04.039
they start to decrease as we get older,

00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:08.766
while factors involved in repair,
in injury and in inflammation --

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.740
they increase as we get older.

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:15.806
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:19.981
And to illustrate what we can do
potentially with that,

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:22.657
I want to talk you through
an experiment that we did.

00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:26.330
We had almost 300 blood samples
from healthy human beings

00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.871
20 to 89 years of age,

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.790
and we measured over 100
of these communication factors,

00:05:32.814 --> 00:05:36.908
these hormone-like proteins that
transport information between tissues.

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:38.942
And what we noticed first

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:41.783
is that between the youngest
and the oldest group,

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:45.104
about half the factors
changed significantly.

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.263
So our body lives in a very
different environment as we get older,

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:50.038
when it comes to these factors.

00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:53.558
And using statistical
or bioinformatics programs,

00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:58.276
we could try to discover
those factors that best predict age --

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.943
in a way, back-calculate
the relative age of a person.

00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:05.193
And the way this looks
is shown in this graph.

00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:10.987
So, on the one axis you see
the actual age a person lived,

00:06:11.011 --> 00:06:12.316
the chronological age.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.062
So, how many years they lived.

00:06:14.086 --> 00:06:16.794
And then we take these top factors
that I showed you,

00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:21.662
and we calculate their relative age,
their biological age.

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:26.342
And what you see is that
there is a pretty good correlation,

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:29.681
so we can pretty well predict
the relative age of a person.

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.620
But what's really exciting
are the outliers,

00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:35.448
as they so often are in life.

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:40.490
You can see here, the person
I highlighted with the green dot

00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:43.110
is about 70 years of age

00:06:43.134 --> 00:06:48.140
but seems to have a biological age,
if what we're doing here is really true,

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:50.207
of only about 45.

00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.715
So is this a person that actually
looks much younger than their age?

00:06:54.183 --> 00:06:58.699
But more importantly: Is this a person
who is maybe at a reduced risk

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:02.047
to develop an age-related disease
and will have a long life --

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:03.566
will live to 100 or more?

00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:08.963
On the other hand, the person here,
highlighted with the red dot,

00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:13.893
is not even 40,
but has a biological age of 65.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:18.315
Is this a person at an increased risk
of developing an age-related disease?

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:21.995
So in our lab, we're trying
to understand these factors better,

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:24.257
and many other groups
are trying to understand,

00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.357
what are the true aging factors,

00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:31.354
and can we learn something about them
to possibly predict age-related diseases?

00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:36.343
So what I've shown you so far
is simply correlational, right?

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:40.398
You can just say,
"Well, these factors change with age,"

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:44.077
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:48.079
So what I'm going to show you now
is very remarkable

00:07:48.103 --> 00:07:53.174
and it suggests that these factors
can actually modulate the age of a tissue.

00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:57.143
And that's where we come back
to this model called parabiosis.

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.707
So, parabiosis is done in mice

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:04.643
by surgically connecting
the two mice together,

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.000
and that leads then
to a shared blood system,

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:11.811
where we can now ask,
"How does the old brain get influenced

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:13.573
by exposure to the young blood?"

00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:16.348
And for this purpose, we use young mice

00:08:16.372 --> 00:08:19.825
that are an equivalency
of 20-year-old people,

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:24.185
and old mice that are roughly
65 years old in human years.

00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.784
What we found is quite remarkable.

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:31.528
We find there are more neural stem cells
that make new neurons

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:32.884
in these old brains.

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:35.933
There's an increased
activity of the synapses,

00:08:35.957 --> 00:08:37.996
the connections between neurons.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.305
There are more genes expressed
that are known to be involved

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:43.076
in the formation of new memories.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.167
And there's less of this bad inflammation.

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:53.923
But we observed that there are no cells
entering the brains of these animals.

00:08:53.947 --> 00:08:55.333
So when we connect them,

00:08:55.357 --> 00:09:00.733
there are actually no cells
going into the old brain, in this model.

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.040
Instead, we've reasoned, then,
that it must be the soluble factors,

00:09:05.064 --> 00:09:09.847
so we could collect simply the soluble
fraction of blood which is called plasma,

00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:13.815
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:16.207
and we could reproduce
these rejuvenating effects,

00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.945
but what we could also do now

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.419
is we could do memory tests with mice.

00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:24.296
As mice get older, like us humans,
they have memory problems.

00:09:24.818 --> 00:09:26.411
It's just harder to detect them,

00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:28.779
but I'll show you in a minute
how we do that.

00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:31.498
But we wanted to take this
one step further,

00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:35.562
one step closer to potentially
being relevant to humans.

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:38.783
What I'm showing you now
are unpublished studies,

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:43.340
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,

00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:45.213
and as a control, saline,

00:09:45.237 --> 00:09:47.113
and injected it into old mice,

00:09:47.137 --> 00:09:51.989
and asked, can we again
rejuvenate these old mice?

00:09:52.013 --> 00:09:53.673
Can we make them smarter?

00:09:54.104 --> 00:09:57.393
And to do this, we used a test.
It's called a Barnes maze.

00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:00.572
This is a big table
that has lots of holes in it,

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:04.079
and there are guide marks around it,

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.709
and there's a bright light,
as on this stage here.

00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:09.866
The mice hate this and they try to escape,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.146
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.115
where a tube is mounted underneath

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:19.332
where they can escape
and feel comfortable in a dark hole.

00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:21.779
So we teach them, over several days,

00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:24.706
to find this space
on these cues in the space,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.524
and you can compare this for humans,

00:10:27.548 --> 00:10:31.778
to finding your car in a parking lot
after a busy day of shopping.

00:10:31.802 --> 00:10:32.803
(Laughter)

00:10:32.827 --> 00:10:36.578
Many of us have probably had
some problems with that.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.620
So, let's look at an old mouse here.

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:41.130
This is an old mouse
that has memory problems,

00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:42.843
as you'll notice in a moment.

00:10:43.305 --> 00:10:48.029
It just looks into every hole,
but it didn't form this spacial map

00:10:48.053 --> 00:10:53.300
that would remind it where it was
in the previous trial or the last day.

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:59.340
In stark contrast, this mouse here
is a sibling of the same age,

00:10:59.364 --> 00:11:04.783
but it was treated with young
human plasma for three weeks,

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:07.340
with small injections every three days.

00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:11.964
And as you noticed, it almost
looks around, "Where am I?" --

00:11:11.988 --> 00:11:14.895
and then walks straight
to that hole and escapes.

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:17.783
So, it could remember where that hole was.

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:22.430
So by all means, this old mouse
seems to be rejuvenated --

00:11:22.454 --> 00:11:24.833
it functions more like a younger mouse.

00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:27.563
And it also suggests
that there is something

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:32.578
not only in young mouse plasma,
but in young human plasma

00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:36.262
that has the capacity
to help this old brain.

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:37.986
So to summarize,

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.209
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:45.684
They're not set in stone;
we can actually change them.

00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:47.181
It can be rejuvenated.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.277
Young blood factors can reverse aging,

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.013
and what I didn't show you --

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:57.259
in this model, the young mouse actually
suffers from exposure to the old.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:12:00.663
So there are old-blood factors
that can accelerate aging.

00:12:01.725 --> 00:12:06.042
And most importantly,
humans may have similar factors,

00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:10.144
because we can take young human
blood and have a similar effect.

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:14.148
Old human blood, I didn't show you,
does not have this effect;

00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:15.934
it does not make the mice younger.

00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:20.699
So, is this magic transferable to humans?

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:24.352
We're running a small
clinical study at Stanford,

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:28.252
where we treat Alzheimer's patients
with mild disease

00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:34.886
with a pint of plasma
from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.505
and do this once a week for four weeks,

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:40.692
and then we look
at their brains with imaging.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.894
We test them cognitively,

00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:46.924
and we ask their caregivers
for daily activities of living.

00:12:46.948 --> 00:12:50.867
What we hope is that there are
some signs of improvement

00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:52.255
from this treatment.

00:12:52.758 --> 00:12:55.314
And if that's the case,
that could give us hope

00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:57.758
that what I showed you works in mice

00:12:57.782 --> 00:12:59.560
might also work in humans.

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:02.836
Now, I don't think we will live forever.

00:13:03.955 --> 00:13:06.292
But maybe we discovered

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:09.403
that the Fountain of Youth
is actually within us,

00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:11.165
and it has just dried out.

00:13:11.574 --> 00:13:14.402
And if we can turn it
back on a little bit,

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:19.053
maybe we can find the factors
that are mediating these effects,

00:13:19.077 --> 00:13:21.664
we can produce these factors synthetically

00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:25.701
and we can treat diseases of aging,
such as Alzheimer's disease

00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:26.955
or other dementias.

00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:28.433
Thank you very much.

00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:31.750
