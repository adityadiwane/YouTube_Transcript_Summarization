00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.476
So, let me add to the complexity

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.066
of the situation we find ourselves in.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.416
At the same time that we're solving
for climate change,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.243
we're going to be building cities
for three billion people.

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:29.005
That's a doubling
of the urban environment.

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.400
If we don't get that right,

00:00:31.424 --> 00:00:35.955
I'm not sure all the climate solutions
in the world will save mankind,

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:40.402
because so much depends
on how we shape our cities:

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:42.656
not just environmental impacts,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.316
but our social well-being,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.622
our economic vitality,

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.445
our sense of community and connectedness.

00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:53.145
Fundamentally, the way we shape cities
is a manifestation

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:55.828
of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:58.962
And so getting it right is, I think,

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.632
the order of the day.

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:04.284
And to a certain degree, getting it right
can help us solve climate change,

00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:05.460
because in the end,

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:08.912
it's our behavior that seems
to be driving the problem.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.814
The problem isn't free-floating,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:14.744
and it isn't just ExxonMobil
and oil companies.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.481
It's us; how we live.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.380
How we live.

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:21.429
There's a villain in this story.

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:24.966
It's called sprawl,
and I'll be upfront about that.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.775
But it's not just the kind of sprawl
you think of, or many people think of,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.429
as low-density development

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.101
out at the periphery
of the metropolitan area.

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:38.472
Actually, I think sprawl can happen
anywhere, at any density.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.317
The key attribute
is that it isolates people.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.764
It segregates people
into economic enclaves

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:48.380
and land-use enclaves.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:50.500
It separates them from nature.

00:01:50.524 --> 00:01:53.678
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:54.966
the interaction,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.413
that make cities great places

00:01:57.437 --> 00:01:59.683
and that make society thrive.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.951
So the antidote to sprawl is really
what we all need to be thinking about,

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:09.398
especially when we're taking on
this massive construction project.

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:12.410
So let me take you through one exercise.

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:16.200
We developed the model
for the state of California

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:19.307
so they could get on
with reducing carbon emissions.

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:25.362
We did a whole series of scenarios
for how the state could grow,

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.509
and this is just one
overly simplified one.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.329
We mixed different development prototypes

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:35.164
and said they're going to carry us
through the year 2050,

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:39.944
10 million new crew
in our state of California.

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:41.763
And one was sprawl.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:45.319
It's just more of the same:
shopping malls, subdivisions,

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:46.527
office parks.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.341
The other one was dominated by,
not everybody moving to the city,

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:52.048
but just compact development,

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.630
what we used to think of
as streetcar suburbs,

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:55.893
walkable neighborhoods,

00:02:55.917 --> 00:03:00.182
low-rise, but integrated,
mixed-used environments.

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.225
And the results are astounding.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.412
They're astounding not just
for the scale of the difference

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.671
of this one shift
in our city-making habit

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:15.409
but also because each one represents
a special interest group,

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:20.442
a special interest group
that used to advocate for their concerns

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.631
one at a time.

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:26.754
They did not see the, what I call,
"co-benefits" of urban form

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:29.253
that allows them to join with others.

00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:30.865
So, land consumption:

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.703
environmentalists are really
concerned about this,

00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:34.912
so are farmers;

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:37.738
there's a whole range of people,

00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:41.149
and, of course, neighborhood groups
that want open space nearby.

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.767
The sprawl version of California

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.417
almost doubles the urban
physical footprint.

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.924
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:55.763
because in California, our biggest
carbon emission comes from cars,

00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:59.487
and cities that don't depend
on cars as much

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:02.558
obviously create huge savings.

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:06.497
Vehicle miles traveled:
that's what I was just talking about.

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.506
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles
per household per year,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.860
from somewhere
in the mid-26,000 per household,

00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:21.764
has a huge impact
not just on air quality and carbon

00:04:21.788 --> 00:04:24.359
but also on the household pocketbook.

00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:27.376
It's very expensive to drive that much,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.792
and as we've seen,

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.331
the middle class is struggling to hold on.

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:36.118
Health care: we were talking about
how do you fix it once we broke it --

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.301
clean the air.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:39.316
Why not just stop polluting?

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.768
Why not just use our feet and bikes more?

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:45.983
And that's a function of the kinds
of cities that we shape.

00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:48.526
Household costs:

00:04:49.063 --> 00:04:51.361
2008 was a mark in time,

00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:54.947
not of just the financial
industry running amok.

00:04:55.463 --> 00:05:00.122
It was that we were trying to sell
too many of the wrong kind of housing:

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:03.097
large lot, single family, distant,

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:07.322
too expensive for the average
middle-class family to afford

00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:10.948
and, quite frankly, not a good fit
to their lifestyle anymore.

00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:12.888
But in order to move inventory,

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:16.492
you can discount the financing
and get it sold.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.364
I think that's a lot of what happened.

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:21.054
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --

00:05:21.078 --> 00:05:23.915
remember, in California
the median is 50,000 --

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:25.820
this is a big element.

00:05:25.844 --> 00:05:28.473
That's just cars and utility costs.

00:05:28.497 --> 00:05:32.697
So the affordable housing advocates,
who often sit off in their silos

00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:37.185
separate from the environmentalists,
separate from the politicians,

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.187
everybody fighting with everyone,

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:41.129
now begin to see common cause,

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:44.589
and I think the common cause
is what really brings about the change.

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:48.537
Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,

00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:51.585
has now decided to transform itself

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:54.981
into a more transit-oriented environment.

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:56.739
As a matter of fact, since '08,

00:05:56.763 --> 00:06:00.712
they've voted in 400 billion dollars
of bonds for transit

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.585
and zero dollars for new highways.

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:04.777
What a transformation:

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:08.132
LA becomes a city of walkers and transit,

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:09.335
not a city of cars.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.366
(Applause)

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.590
How does it happen?

00:06:11.614 --> 00:06:13.751
You take the least
desirable land, the strip,

00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:15.822
you add where there's space, transit

00:06:15.846 --> 00:06:20.109
and then you infill mixed-use development,

00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:22.316
you satisfy new housing demands

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.331
and you make the existing neighborhoods

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.820
all around it more complex,

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.749
more interesting, more walkable.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.893
Here's another kind of sprawl:

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:35.115
China, high-density sprawl,
what you think of as an oxymoron,

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.573
but the same problems,
everything isolated in superblocks,

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:42.125
and of course this amazing smog
that was just spoken to.

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.378
Twelve percent of GDP
in China now is spent

00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:47.599
on the health impacts of that.

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:50.888
The history, of course,
of Chinese cities is robust.

00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:52.164
It's like any other place.

00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:55.200
Community was all about small, local shops

00:06:55.224 --> 00:06:59.367
and local services and walking,
interacting with your neighbors.

00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.515
It may sound utopian, but it's not.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.506
It's actually what people really want.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.077
The new superblocks --

00:07:05.101 --> 00:07:09.021
these are blocks that would have
5,000 units in them,

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:12.857
and they're gated as well,
because nobody knows anybody else.

00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:16.381
And of course, there isn't even
a sidewalk, no ground floor shops --

00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:18.269
a very sterile environment.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:23.454
I found this one case
here in one of the superblocks

00:07:23.478 --> 00:07:26.704
where people had illicitly set up
shops in their garages

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:30.426
so that they could have that kind
of local service economy.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.207
The desire of people
to get it right is there.

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.519
We just have to get the planners
on board and the politicians.

00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:42.789
All right. Some technical planning stuff.

00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:45.986
Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.373
It's almost as big as California.

00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:50.087
This is a small growth area.

00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.723
They wanted us to test
the alternative to sprawl

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:56.521
in several cities across China.

00:07:56.892 --> 00:08:00.174
This is for four-and-a-half
million people.

00:08:00.198 --> 00:08:02.129
What the takeaway from this image is,

00:08:02.153 --> 00:08:04.802
every one of those circles
is a walking radius

00:08:04.826 --> 00:08:06.442
around a transit station --

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.055
massive investment in metro and BRT,

00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:13.096
and a distribution that allows everybody

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.731
to work within walking distance of that.

00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:18.052
The red area, this is a blow-up.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:21.233
All of a sudden, our principles
called for green space

00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:24.947
preserving the important
ecological features.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.298
And then those other streets in there
are auto-free streets.

00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:32.945
So instead of bulldozing,
leveling the site

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:35.032
and building right up to the river,

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:39.280
this green edge was something
that really wasn't normative in China

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.875
until these set of practices

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:44.453
began experimentation there.

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:46.838
The urban fabric, small blocks,

00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:49.478
maybe 500 families per block.

00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:50.771
They know each other.

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:53.158
The street perimeter has shops

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:55.104
so there's local destinations.

00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:57.483
And the streets themselves become smaller,

00:08:57.507 --> 00:08:59.037
because there are more of them.

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:00.612
Very simple,

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:03.191
straightforward urban design.

00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:06.425
Now, here you have something
I dearly love.

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:07.723
Think of the logic.

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.319
If only a third of the people have cars,

00:09:10.343 --> 00:09:14.107
why do we give 100 percent
of our streets to cars?

00:09:14.748 --> 00:09:17.927
What if we gave 70 percent of the streets

00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:20.126
to car-free, to everybody else,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.395
so that the transit
could move well for them,

00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:24.744
so that they could walk,
so they could bike?

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.166
Why not have --

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.643
(Applause)

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.820
geographic equity

00:09:29.844 --> 00:09:32.215
in our circulation system?

00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:35.911
And quite frankly,
cities would function better.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.590
No matter what they do,

00:09:37.614 --> 00:09:40.044
no matter how many ring roads
they build in Beijing,

00:09:40.068 --> 00:09:42.996
they just can't overcome
complete gridlock.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.708
So this is an auto-free street,
mixed use along the edge.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.345
It has transit running down the middle.

00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:52.473
I'm happy to make that transit
autonomous vehicles,

00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:55.407
but maybe I'll have a chance
to talk about that later.

00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:59.154
So there are seven principles
that have now been adopted

00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:01.878
by the highest levels
in the Chinese government,

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.697
and they're moving to implement them.

00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:04.883
And they're simple,

00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:07.520
and they are globally,
I think, universal principles.

00:10:07.544 --> 00:10:11.197
One is to preserve
the natural environment, the history

00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:13.188
and the critical agriculture.

00:10:14.126 --> 00:10:15.449
Second is mix.

00:10:15.473 --> 00:10:17.990
Mixed use is popular,
but when I say mixed,

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:20.453
I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups

00:10:20.477 --> 00:10:22.969
as well as mixed-land use.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.164
Walk.

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:28.208
There's no great city
that you don't enjoy walking in.

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.550
You don't go there.

00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:32.126
The places you go on vacation
are places you can walk.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.912
Why not make it everywhere?

00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.953
Bike is the most efficient
means of transportation we know.

00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:42.074
China has now adopted policies
that put six meters of bike lane

00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:43.427
on every street.

00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:47.393
They're serious about getting back
to their biking history.

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:48.873
(Applause)

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:51.200
Complicated planner-ese here:

00:10:51.224 --> 00:10:52.553
connect.

00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:56.089
It's a street network
that allows many routes

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:57.924
instead of singular routes

00:10:57.948 --> 00:11:01.495
and provides many kinds of streets
instead of just one.

00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:03.916
Ride.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.250
We have to invest more in transit.

00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:08.049
There's no silver bullet.

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:11.137
Autonomous vehicles are not
going to solve this for us.

00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:16.327
As a matter of fact, they're going
to generate more traffic, more VMT,

00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:17.713
than the alternative.

00:11:17.737 --> 00:11:18.951
And focus.

00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:23.131
We have a hierarchy of the city
based on transit

00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:26.318
rather than the old armature of freeways.

00:11:26.342 --> 00:11:28.492
It's a big paradigm shift,

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.732
but those two things
have to get reconnected

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:36.276
in ways that really shape
the structure of the city.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.496
So I'm very hopeful.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.293
In California, the United States, China --
these changes are well accepted.

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:46.952
I'm hopeful for two reasons.

00:11:46.976 --> 00:11:49.055
One is, most people get it.

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.961
They understand intrinsically

00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.627
what a great city can and should be.

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:58.492
The second is that the kind of analysis
we can bring to bear now

00:11:58.516 --> 00:12:01.244
allows people to connect the dots,

00:12:01.756 --> 00:12:04.725
allows people to shape
political coalitions

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:06.178
that didn't exist in the past.

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:10.279
That allows them to bring into being
the kinds of communities we all need.

00:12:10.303 --> 00:12:11.492
Thank you.

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:18.093
(Applause)

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:23.275
Chris Anderson: So, OK:
autonomous driving, self-driving cars.

00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:26.644
A lot of people here
are very excited about them.

00:12:27.263 --> 00:12:30.222
What are your concerns
or issues about them?

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:33.388
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think
there's almost too much hype here.

00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:36.986
First is, everybody says
we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.304
What they don't say is you're going
to get a lot more vehicle miles.

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:42.875
You're going to get a lot more
cars moving on streets.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:44.768
There will be more congestion.

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:47.100
CA: Because they're so appealing --

00:12:47.124 --> 00:12:49.178
you can drive while reading or sleeping.

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:50.699
PC: Well, a couple of reasons.

00:12:50.723 --> 00:12:54.694
One is, if they're privately owned,
people will travel greater distances.

00:12:54.718 --> 00:12:56.659
It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.

00:12:56.683 --> 00:12:58.698
If you can work on your way to work,

00:12:58.722 --> 00:13:00.789
you can live in more remote locations.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.355
It'll revitalize sprawl

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:05.712
in a way that I'm deeply frightened.

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.590
Taxis:

00:13:07.614 --> 00:13:11.362
about 50 percent of the surveys say
that people won't share them.

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:12.760
If they don't share them,

00:13:12.784 --> 00:13:17.981
you can end up with a 90 percent
increase in vehicle miles traveled.

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:19.738
If you share them,

00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:23.292
you're still at around
a 30 percent increase in VMT.

00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:26.354
CA: Sharing them, meaning
having multiple people riding at once

00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:28.354
in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?

00:13:28.378 --> 00:13:30.909
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share
without a steering wheel.

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:34.782
The reality is, the efficiency
of vehicles -- you can do it

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:37.297
with or without a steering wheel,
it doesn't matter.

00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:40.814
They claim they're the only ones
that are going to be efficient electric,

00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:41.992
but that's not true.

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:45.586
But the real bottom line
is that walking, biking and transit

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.774
are the way cities and communities thrive.

00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:51.605
And putting people
in their private bubbles,

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:53.926
whether they have a steering wheel or not,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.521
is the wrong direction.

00:13:55.545 --> 00:13:56.696
And quite frankly,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.399
the image of an AV on its way
to McDonald's to pick up a pack

00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:04.107
without its owner,

00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:07.841
just being sent off on these
kind of random errands

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.262
is really frightening to me.

00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:12.644
CA: Well, thank you for that,
and I have to say, the images you showed

00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:15.844
of those mixed-use streets
were really inspiring, really beautiful.

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:18.027
PC: Thank you.
CA: Thank you for your work.

00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:19.510
(Applause)
