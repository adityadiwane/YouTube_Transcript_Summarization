00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.036
Almost a year ago,

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:16.897
my aunt started suffering back pains.

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:18.262
She went to see the doctor

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:20.511
and they told her it was a normal injury

00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:22.165
for someone who had been playing tennis

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:24.190
for almost 30 years.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.158
They recommended that she do some therapy,

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.253
but after a while she wasn't feeling better,

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:32.593
so the doctors decided to do further tests.

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:33.592
They did an x-ray

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:35.681
and discovered an injury in her lungs,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.238
and at the time they thought that the injury

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:38.796
was a strain in the muscles and tendons

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:39.966
between her ribs,

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.735
but after a few weeks of treatment,

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.793
again her health wasn't getting any better.

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:49.483
So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:50.700
and two weeks later,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.443
the results of the biopsy came back.

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:58.212
It was stage 3 lung cancer.

00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:01.114
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:02.847
She never smoked a cigarette,

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:04.613
she never drank alcohol,

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:05.715
and she had been playing sports

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:07.897
for almost half her life.

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:11.073
Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:14.197
to get her properly diagnosed.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.300
My story might be, unfortunately,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.539
familiar to most of you.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.240
One out of three people sitting in this audience

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.166
will be diagnosed with some type of cancer,

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.312
and one out of four

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:28.910
will die because of it.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.992
Not only did that cancer diagnosis

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.859
change the life of our family,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.872
but that process of going

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:37.480
back and forth with new tests,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.248
different doctors describing symptoms,

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:42.420
discarding diseases over and over,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.800
was stressful and frustrating,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.712
especially for my aunt.

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:49.423
And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:51.763
since the beginning of history.

00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:54.609
We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.172
to treat cancer,

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.714
but we still have 20th-century procedures

00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:02.842
and processes for diagnosis, if any.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:05.486
Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:07.953
to indicate that something is wrong.

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.470
Today, the majority of people still don't have access

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.888
to early cancer detection methods,

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:14.260
even though we know

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.184
that catching cancer early

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:17.647
is basically the closest thing we have

00:02:17.647 --> 00:02:21.127
to a silver bullet cure against it.

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:23.608
We know that we can change this in our lifetime,

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:25.160
and that is why my team and I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.354
have decided to begin this journey,

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:29.860
this journey to try to make cancer detection

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.405
at the early stages

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:34.557
and monitoring the appropriate 
response at the molecular level

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:38.819
easier, cheaper, smarter

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.276
and more accessible than ever before.

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:43.648
The context, of course,

00:02:43.648 --> 00:02:45.191
is that we're living at a time

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.600
where technology is disrupting our present

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.107
at exponential rates,

00:02:48.107 --> 00:02:51.117
and the biological realm is no exception.

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:53.547
It is said today that biotech is advancing

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:55.842
at least six times faster than the growth rate

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.218
of the processing power of computers.

00:02:58.218 --> 00:02:59.530
But progress in biotech

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.170
is not only being accelerated,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.216
it is also being democratized.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.428
Just as personal computers or the Internet

00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:08.879
or smartphones leveled the playing field

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.736
for entrepreneurship, politics or education,

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:15.156
recent advances have leveled it
up for biotech progress as well,

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:16.449
and that is allowing

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.564
multidisciplinary teams like ours

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.219
to try to tackle and look at these problems

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.570
with new approaches.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.193
We are a team of scientists and technologists

00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:29.183
from Chile, Panama,

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:32.570
Mexico, Israel and Greece,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.192
and based on recent scientific discoveries,

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:36.574
we believe that we have found

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:39.375
a reliable and accurate way

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.377
of detecting several types of cancer

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:44.275
at the very early stages through a blood sample.

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.223
We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:48.892
that circulate freely in our blood

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.688
called microRNAs.

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:53.999
To explain what microRNAs are

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.214
and their important role in cancer,

00:03:56.214 --> 00:03:57.607
I need to start with proteins,

00:03:57.607 --> 00:04:00.160
because when cancer is present in our body,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.591
protein modification is observed

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.202
in all cancerous cells.

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:04.575
As you might know,

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:06.850
proteins are large biological molecules

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.190
that perform different functions within our body,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.275
like catalyzing metabolic reactions

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:13.121
or responding to stimuli

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.923
or replicating DNA,

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:17.666
but before a protein is expressed or produced,

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.364
relevant parts of its genetic code

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:21.513
present in the DNA

00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:25.482
are copied into the messenger RNA,

00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:27.392
so this messenger RNA

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:31.106
has instructions on how to build a specific protein,

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:33.706
and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.303
but the one that tells them when to build them

00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:38.632
and how many to build

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:41.070
are microRNAs.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.900
So microRNAs are small molecules

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.100
that regulate gene expression.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.315
Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.464
microRNAs can vary depending on internal

00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:52.321
and environmental conditions at any given time,

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:55.775
telling us which genes are actively 
expressed at that particular moment.

00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:57.194
And that is what makes microRNAs

00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:59.495
such a promising biomarker for cancer,

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:01.377
because as you know,

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:05.190
cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.744
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.

00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:10.398
Another important thing to consider

00:05:10.398 --> 00:05:12.817
is that no two cancers are the same,

00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:15.865
but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:18.115
Several scientific studies have shown

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:21.456
that abnormal microRNA expression levels

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:24.571
varies and creates a unique, specific pattern

00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.259
for each type of cancer,

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.991
even at the early stages,

00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:29.881
reflecting the progression of the disease,

00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:31.782
and whether it's responding to medication

00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:32.990
or in remission,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.123
making microRNAs a perfect,

00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:38.727
highly sensitive biomarker.

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:41.401
However, the problem with microRNAs

00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.950
is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.563
to detect them in a reliable way,

00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:49.353
because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,

00:05:49.353 --> 00:05:51.535
much smaller than DNA.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:54.550
And also, all microRNAs are
very similar to each other,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.597
with just tiny differences.

00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:59.117
So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,

00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:02.311
extremely similar, extremely small.

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:05.217
We believe that we have found a way to do so,

00:06:05.217 --> 00:06:07.966
and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.467
Let me do a demonstration.

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:12.908
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.831
and do your next standard blood test,

00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:17.183
a lab technician extracts a total RNA,

00:06:17.183 --> 00:06:19.106
which is quite simple today,

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:21.898
and puts it in a standard 
96-well plate like this one.

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.565
Each well of these plates

00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:26.204
has specific biochemistry that we assign,

00:06:26.204 --> 00:06:28.544
that is looking for a specific microRNA,

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:30.323
acting like a trap that closes

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.680
only when the microRNA is present in the sample,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.801
and when it does, it will shine with green color.

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:36.904
To run the reaction,

00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:40.040
you put the plate inside a device like this one,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.930
and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.670
If we can have a camera here

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.378
so you can see my screen.

00:06:49.378 --> 00:06:51.774
A smartphone is a connected computer

00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:53.383
and it's also a camera,

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:55.531
good enough for our purpose.

00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:01.411
The smartphone is taking pictures,

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:02.755
and when the reaction is over,

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:03.798
it will send the pictures

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.112
to our online database for processing

00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:07.730
and interpretation.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.455
This entire process lasts around 60 minutes,

00:07:10.455 --> 00:07:12.300
but when the process is over,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.325
wells that shine are matched 
with the specific microRNAs

00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:17.969
and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:19.218
they shine.

00:07:19.218 --> 00:07:23.486
And then, when this entire process is over,

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:25.944
this is what happens.

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:28.541
This chart is showing the specific microRNAs

00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:29.976
present in this sample

00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:32.388
and how they reacted over time.

00:07:32.388 --> 00:07:34.890
Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.296
of this person's samples

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:39.272
and compare it with existing scientific documentation

00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:41.220
that correlates microRNA patterns

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.501
with a specific presence of a disease,

00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:49.950
this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.607
This inside is a real sample

00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:55.926
where we just detected pancreatic cancer.

00:07:55.926 --> 00:08:00.365
(Applause)

00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:06.444
Another important aspect of this approach

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.783
is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,

00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:10.426
so we can get results in real time

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:13.863
and analyze them with our contextual information.

00:08:13.863 --> 00:08:15.341
If we want to better understand

00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:17.456
and decode diseases like cancer,

00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:18.806
we need to stop treating them

00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:20.988
as acute, isolated episodes,

00:08:20.988 --> 00:08:22.912
and consider and measure everything

00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:27.220
that affects our health on a permanent basis.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.506
This entire platform is a working prototype.

00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:34.971
It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.717
a low-cost, 3D-printed device,

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.679
and data science

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.594
to try to tackle one of humanity's 
toughest challenges.

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:45.596
Since we believe early cancer detection

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:47.384
should really be democratized,

00:08:47.384 --> 00:08:49.769
this entire solution costs at least 50 times less

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.770
than current available methods,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.503
and we know that the community can help us

00:08:53.503 --> 00:08:54.988
accelerate this even more,

00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:56.923
so we're making the design of the device

00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:59.400
open-source.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.994
(Applause)

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:09.541
Let me say very clearly

00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.276
that we are at the very early stages,

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:13.257
but so far, we have been able

00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:15.866
to successfully identify the microRNA pattern

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:19.128
of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,

00:09:19.128 --> 00:09:22.188
breast cancer and hepatic cancer.

00:09:22.188 --> 00:09:25.370
And currently, we're doing a clinical trial

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.249
in collaboration with the
German Cancer Research Center

00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:31.840
with 200 women for breast cancer.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.448
(Applause)

00:09:35.448 --> 00:09:38.162
This is the single non-invasive,

00:09:38.162 --> 00:09:40.904
accurate and affordable test

00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:43.150
that has the potential to dramatically change

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.960
how cancer procedures and diagnostics

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.780
have been done.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.397
Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns

00:09:48.397 --> 00:09:50.962
in your blood at any given time,

00:09:50.962 --> 00:09:52.858
you don't need to know
which cancer you're looking for.

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:55.025
You don't need to have any symptoms.

00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:57.833
You only need one milliliter of blood

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:01.343
and a relatively simple array of tools.

00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:04.155
Today, cancer detection happens mainly

00:10:04.155 --> 00:10:06.240
when symptoms appear.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.869
That is, at stage 3 or 4,

00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:10.793
and I believe that is too late.

00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:12.941
It is too expensive for our families.

00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:15.393
It is too expensive for humanity.

00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:18.340
We cannot lose the war against cancer.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.230
It not only costs us billions of dollars,

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.152
but it also costs us the people we love.

00:10:23.152 --> 00:10:26.650
Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.560
and going through this process
with a very positive attitude.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.138
However, I want fights like this

00:10:32.138 --> 00:10:33.761
to become very rare.

00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:34.888
I want to see the day

00:10:34.888 --> 00:10:36.815
when cancer is treated easily

00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:38.967
because it can be routinely diagnosed

00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:40.924
at the very early stages,

00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:42.016
and I'm certain

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.152
that in the very near future,

00:10:44.152 --> 00:10:45.450
because of this

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.690
and other breakthroughs that we are seeing

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.713
every day in the life sciences,

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:50.345
the way we see cancer

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:52.336
will radically change.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:54.800
It will give us the chance of detecting it early,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.565
understanding it better,

00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:58.801
and finding a cure.

00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:00.480
Thank you very much.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:08.688
(Applause)
