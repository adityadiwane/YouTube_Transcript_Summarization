00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:14.231
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:17.413
My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician."

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.136
What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.136
to do something I call "mathemagics."

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.351
But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.136
By any chance, did anyone happen

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.777
to bring with them
this morning a calculator?

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.436
Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.736
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.303
Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else?

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:43.136
I see, I see one way in the back.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.136
You sir, that's three.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.984
And anybody on this side here?

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:49.508
OK, over there on the aisle.

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.166
Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.611
then join me up on stage.

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:55.875
Let's give them a nice round of applause.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.712
(Applause)

00:00:58.736 --> 00:00:59.821
That's right.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:03.259
Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators,

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:06.136
I need to make sure
that they are all working properly.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.490
Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please?

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:13.023
How about a two-digit number?

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.136
Audience: 22.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.168
AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:17.199
Audience: 47.

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:21.136
AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.897
or the calculators are not working.

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:26.065
Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:27.136
Volunteer: No.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.136
AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.136
(Applause)

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.389
Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case?

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:37.525
OK, great.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.272
What I'm going to try and do then --

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:42.581
I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:43.606
That's OK.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.136
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.681
There is something called
the square of a number,

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.365
which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:55.136
For instance, five squared would be?

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.167
Audience: 25.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.669
AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators --

00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:00.384
let me demonstrate with this one --

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:02.842
is by taking the number, such as five,

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:05.576
hitting "times" and then "equals,"

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.354
and on most calculators
that will give you the square.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.425
On some of these ancient RPN calculators,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.627
you've got an "x squared" button on it,

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.136
will allow you to do
the calculation even faster.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.136
What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.136
four two-digit numbers

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.507
faster than they can do
on their calculators,

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.375
even using the shortcut method.

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.541
What I'll use is the second row this time,

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:28.073
and I'll get four of you

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:29.874
to each yell out a two-digit number,

00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:33.136
and if you would square the first number,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.065
and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth,

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.554
I will try and race you to the answer. OK?

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:41.137
So quickly, a two-digit number please.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.223
Audience: 37.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:44.112
Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:45.136
Audience: 23.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.668
AB: 23 squared, OK.

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:47.763
Audience: 59.

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:49.843
AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:50.892
Audience: 93.

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:51.964
AB: 93 squared.

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:54.136
Would you call out your answers, please?

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.136
Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.136
Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.136
Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.183
Volunteer: 8649.

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.366
AB: Thank you very much.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.503
(Applause)

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:10.455
Let me try to take this one step further.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.500
I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time.

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:15.136
I won't even write these down --

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.637
I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me.

00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:20.136
Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.356
Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.403
Just give some indication if it's right.

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:27.030
A three-digit number, sir, yes?

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:28.136
Audience: 987.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.619
AB: 987 squared is 974,169.

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:33.723
(Laughter)

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.417
AB: Yes? Good.

00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:37.137
Another three-digit --

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:39.091
(Applause)

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:41.553
-- another three-digit number, sir?

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:42.583
Audience: 457.

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:45.669
AB: 457 squared is 205,849.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.136
205,849?

00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:48.948
AB: Yes?

00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:51.329
OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir?

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:52.377
Audience: 321.

00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:55.026
AB: 321 is 103,041.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.786
103,041.

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.303
Yes? One more three-digit number please.

00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:01.485
Audience: Oh, 722.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.413
AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.

00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:07.247
Is that 513,284?

00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.326
Volunteer: Yes.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.239
AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:12.294
Audience: 162.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:16.137
162 squared is 26,244.

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:17.247
Volunteer: Yes.

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:18.280
Thank you very much.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:20.027
(Applause)

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.136
(Applause ends)

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.136
Let me try to take this one step further.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.548
(Laughter)

00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:33.136
I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.897
You can all take your time on this;

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:37.115
I will not beat you
to the answer on this one,

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.041
but I will try to get the answer right.

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.604
To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time,

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.282
let's say, one, two, three, four.

00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:47.480
If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine,

00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:49.994
that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square.

00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:51.747
Nine.

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:52.842
Seven.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.311
Five.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.374
Eight.

00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:58.492
9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me.

00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:00.723
95 million --

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.984
(Sighs)

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:07.880
218,564?

00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:08.929
Volunteer: Yes!

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:10.191
AB: Thank you very much.

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:13.245
(Applause)

00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:18.136
(Applause ends)

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.421
Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number --

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:22.954
and I can --

00:05:22.978 --> 00:05:25.939
but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot.

00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:27.929
(Laughter)

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.757
Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that?

00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:33.734
So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators --

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:34.806
what's that?

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:38.076
Does yours go higher?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.297
Volunteer: I don't know.

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.523
AB: Oh, yours does?

00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:44.455
Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later.

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.136
In the meanwhile, let me conclude

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.161
the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier.

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:52.671
Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649.

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.136
Would you each enter
that on your calculator?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.136
And instead of squaring it this time,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.351
I want you to take
that number and multiply it

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.136
by any three-digit number that you want,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.399
but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by --

00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:07.702
just multiply it by any random
three-digit number.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:09.777
So you should have as an answer either

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.829
a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number.

00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:14.903
How many digits do you have, six or seven?

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:16.181
Seven, and yours?

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:17.925
Seven? Seven?

00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:21.136
And, uncertain.

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:22.796
Seven.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.876
Is there any possible way
that I could know

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.576
what seven-digit numbers you have?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.601
Say "No."

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:28.940
(Laughter)

00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:31.061
Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible --

00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:33.136
or at least the improbable.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.684
What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:38.720
any six of your seven digits,
any six of them,

00:06:38.744 --> 00:06:40.867
in any order you'd like.

00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:42.223
(Laughter)

00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:43.670
One digit at a time,

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:47.112
I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out.

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:49.008
Starting with your seven-digit number,

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.706
call out any six of them please.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.081
Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.795
AB: Did you leave out the number 6?

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.136
Good, OK, that's one.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.136
You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.231
Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:09.924
I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 --

00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:11.457
did you leave out the number 6?

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.571
Same as she did, OK.

00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:14.223
You've got a seven-digit number --

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:16.257
call out any six of them loud and clear.

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:20.396
Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.136
I think you left out the number 3?

00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:24.101
AB: That's three.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:27.287
The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing

00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:29.810
would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power.

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:31.399
OK, any six of them.

00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:32.477
(Laughter)

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.556
Really scramble them up this time, please.

00:07:34.794 --> 00:07:38.136
Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.954
Did you leave out the number 7?

00:07:39.978 --> 00:07:43.198
And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause.

00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:44.756
Thank you very much.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.454
(Applause)

00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:51.957
(Applause ends)

00:07:53.013 --> 00:07:54.136
For my next number --

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.108
(Laughter)

00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:59.996
while I mentally recharge my batteries,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.668
I have one more question for the audience.

00:08:02.692 --> 00:08:07.136
By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.494
the day of the week
that they were born on?

00:08:10.518 --> 00:08:14.438
If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand.

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:17.652
Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first.

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:19.327
What year was it, first of all?

00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:21.136
That's why I pick a gentleman first.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.223
Audience: 1953.

00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:24.136
1953, and the month?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.390
November what?

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.070
23rd -- was that a Monday?

00:08:28.094 --> 00:08:29.095
Audience: Yes.

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:30.500
Good. Somebody else?

00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:32.341
I haven't seen any women's hands up.

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.136
OK, how about you, what year?

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:36.136
1949, and the month?

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:38.136
October what?

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.866
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.414
Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you?

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.631
Yell it out, what year?

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:44.743
Audience: 1959.

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.531
1959, OK -- and the month?

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:48.650
Audience: February.

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:50.081
February what?

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:52.136
Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.389
Good, how about the person behind her?

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:56.136
Call out, what year was it?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.826
Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.270
Audience: May.
AB: May what?

00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:02.365
Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.715
Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much.

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:09.743
(Applause)

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.941
Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born?

00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:14.109
We can do it that way.

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:17.143
Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know,

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:18.508
so I come prepared for that.

00:09:18.532 --> 00:09:21.135
I brought with me a book of calendars.

00:09:21.714 --> 00:09:25.959
It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know.

00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.510
(Laughter)

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.651
I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:31.749
(Laughter)

00:09:31.773 --> 00:09:34.725
Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind.

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:36.620
This is a book of calendars.

00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:38.436
Who wanted to know their birth day?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.136
What year was it, first of all?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.191
Audience: 1966.

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.905
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:45.453
And what month?

00:09:45.477 --> 00:09:47.112
Audience: April.
AB: April what?

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:48.157
Audience: 17th.

00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:50.485
I believe that was a Sunday.

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:51.914
Can you confirm, Chris?

00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:54.093
Chris Anderson: Yes.

00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:55.635
AB: I'll tell you what, Chris:

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:57.848
as long as you have
that book in front of you,

00:09:57.872 --> 00:10:01.136
do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.997
either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s --

00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:06.053
that'll be a much greater
challenge for me.

00:10:06.077 --> 00:10:08.136
AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.365
AB: 1824, OK.

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:12.826
AB: And what month?

00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:14.064
CA: June.

00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:15.336
AB: June what?
CA: Sixth.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.520
AB: Was that a Sunday?

00:10:17.744 --> 00:10:19.618
CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy.

00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:20.951
(Laughter)

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:22.681
Good, thank you very much.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.579
(Applause)

00:10:27.298 --> 00:10:28.807
(Applause ends)

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:30.455
But I'd like to wrap things up now

00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:35.136
by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.483
There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator.

00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:41.309
Where is he, would you stand up,

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:42.948
10-digit guy?

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.136
OK, stand up for me just for a second,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.764
so I can see where you are.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.290
You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well?

00:10:52.314 --> 00:10:55.844
OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head

00:10:55.868 --> 00:10:59.248
a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:04.136
But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.032
I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud.

00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:10.921
So you can actually, honestly hear

00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:15.663
what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size.

00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:18.967
Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green.

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:22.063
I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets,

00:11:22.087 --> 00:11:23.349
but I'm not too afraid

00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:26.256
that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so --

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.843
I think we're OK.

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:29.013
(Laughter)

00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:30.293
(Applause)

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:32.968
So, let's see,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:35.935
let's take a different row of people,
starting with you.

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:38.136
I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.478
Oh, I did this row already.

00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:40.921
Let's do the row before you,

00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:43.214
starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five.

00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:44.549
Call out a single digit --

00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:48.554
that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead.

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:50.404
Five.

00:11:50.983 --> 00:11:52.009
Seven.

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:53.110
Six.

00:11:53.134 --> 00:11:54.136
Eight.

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:55.674
Three.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.715
57,683 --

00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:01.828
squared.

00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:02.852
Yuck.

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:07.584
Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.030
I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts.

00:12:11.054 --> 00:12:13.702
I'll do 57,000 squared,

00:12:13.726 --> 00:12:17.136
plus 683 squared,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.921
plus 57,000 times 683 times two.

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:24.737
Add all those numbers together,

00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:27.542
and with any luck, arrive at the answer.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.609
Now, let me recap.

00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:31.476
(Laughter)

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.635
Thank you.

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.532
(Laughter)

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:36.429
While I explain something else --

00:12:36.453 --> 00:12:37.683
(Laughter)

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:39.818
-- I know, that you can use, right?

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:40.847
(Laughter)

00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:42.618
While I do these calculations,

00:12:42.642 --> 00:12:45.121
you might hear certain words,

00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:48.136
as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.558
Let me explain what that is.

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:51.664
This is a phonetic code,

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.764
a mnemonic device that I use,

00:12:53.788 --> 00:12:56.598
that allows me to convert
numbers into words.

00:12:56.622 --> 00:12:59.764
I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers.

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:01.749
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.

00:13:01.773 --> 00:13:05.105
I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man."

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:06.176
(Laughter)

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.256
There's definitely
a method to my madness --

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.508
definitely, definitely.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:10.533
Sorry.

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:14.136
(Laughter)

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.405
If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards,

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.136
you can talk to me then.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.540
By the way, one last instruction,

00:13:20.564 --> 00:13:22.916
for my judges with the calculators --

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.082
you know who you are --

00:13:24.106 --> 00:13:29.136
there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.588
If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is;

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:34.944
just say, "you're close,"
or something like that,

00:13:34.968 --> 00:13:36.944
and I'll try and figure out the answer --

00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:39.136
which could be pretty
entertaining in itself.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.136
If, however, I am right,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.136
whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.366
(Laughter)

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.604
Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right,

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:50.314
because this is my big finish, OK.

00:13:50.338 --> 00:13:53.528
So, without any more stalling,

00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:56.503
here we go.

00:13:56.527 --> 00:13:59.217
I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683.

00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:02.383
57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:04.677
that's 38,760 plus 171,

00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:07.526
38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.136
38,931; double that to get 77,862.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.136
77,862 becomes cookie fission,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.136
cookie fission is 77,822.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.494
That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK.

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:23.764
Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say,

00:14:23.788 --> 00:14:25.518
three billion.

00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:28.136
Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.136
oops, but I see a carry coming --

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.136
249 --

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.136
add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.136
is 327 million --

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.143
fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared,

00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:43.502
that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:46.136
is 466,489, rev up if I need it,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.541
rev up, take the 466,

00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:51.692
add that to fission, to get,

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:53.724
oh gee --

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:58.136
328,489.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.136
Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.516
Thank you very much.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.136
(Applause)

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.649
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.

00:15:04.673 --> 00:15:05.674
Thank you.

00:15:05.698 --> 00:15:08.551
(Applause)
