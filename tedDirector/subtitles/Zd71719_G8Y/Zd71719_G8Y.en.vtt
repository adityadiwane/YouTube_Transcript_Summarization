00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
When we park in a big parking lot,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
how do we remember where we parked our car?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Here's the problem facing Homer.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And we're going to try to understand

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
what's happening in his brain.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
which is the organ of memory.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which it resembles.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
So the human brain

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And the neurons communicate with each other

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
via connections to each other.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
which are very densely interconnected.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And scientists have begun to understand

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
how spatial memory works

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
by recording from individual neurons

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in rats or mice

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
while they forage or explore an environment

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
looking for food.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
in the hippocampus of this rat here.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
there's going to be a red dot and a click.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So what we see

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
is that this neuron knows

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And it signals to the rest of the brain

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
by sending a little electrical spike.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
as a function of the animal's location.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And if we record from lots of different neurons,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
we'll see that different neurons fire

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
like in this square box shown here.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So together they form a map

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
for the rest of the brain,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
telling the brain continually,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
"Where am I now within my environment?"

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
So epilepsy patients sometimes need

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And some of these patients played a video game

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
where they drive around a small town.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
start sending electrical impulses

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So how does a place cell know

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
where the rat or person is within its environment?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Well these two cells here

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
show us that the boundaries of the environment

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
are particularly important.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So the one on the top

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
of the box that their rat's in.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
The one below likes to fire

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And if you put another wall inside the box,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
then the cell fires in both place

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
wherever there's a wall to the south

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
as the animal explores around in its box.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
So this predicts

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
extended buildings and so on --

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
is particularly important for the hippocampus.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
cells are found which project into the hippocampus,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
which do respond exactly

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to detecting boundaries or edges

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
at particular distances and directions

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
from the rat or mouse

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
as it's exploring around.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So the cell on the left, you can see,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
it fires whenever the animal gets near

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
to a wall or a boundary to the east,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
or the circular wall of the circular box

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And the cell on the right there

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So that's one way in which we think

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We can also test where we think objects are,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
like this goal flag, in simple environments --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
or indeed, where your car would be.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So we can have people explore an environment

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and see the location they have to remember.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And then, if we put them back in the environment,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
where they thought that flag or their car was.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But on some trials,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
we could change the shape and size of the environment

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
like we did with the place cell.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
In that case, we can see

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
how where they think the flag had been changes

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And what you see, for example,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and then if you ask people where it was,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
but you've made the environment bigger,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
where they think the flag had been

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
stretches out in exactly the same way

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
that the place cell firing stretched out.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It's as if you remember where the flag was

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
at that location,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and then you can get back to that location

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
by moving around

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
with that stored pattern.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
But we also know where we are through movement.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So if we take some outbound path --

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
perhaps we park and we wander off --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
we know because our own movements,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
which we can integrate over this path

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.260
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Now grid cells are found, again,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
on the inputs to the hippocampus,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and they're a bit like place cells.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
But now as the rat explores around,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
each individual cell fires

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
in a whole array of different locations

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
which are laid out across the environment

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
in an amazingly regular triangular grid.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And if you record from several grid cells --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
shown here in different colors --

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
relative to the other cells.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So the red one fires on this grid

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So together, it's as if the rat

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
can put a virtual grid of firing locations

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
across its environment --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
but using triangles.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And as it moves around,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
the electrical activity can pass

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
from one of these cells to the next cell

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to keep track of where it is,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
so that it can use its own movements

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
to know where it is in its environment.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Do people have grid cells?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
have the same axes of symmetry,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
it means that the net activity

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
should change

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
according to whether we're running along these six directions

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
or running along one of the six directions in between.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So we can put people in an MRI scanner

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and have them do a little video game

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
like the one I showed you

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and look for this signal.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
So back to Homer.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
He's probably remembering where his car was

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
in terms of the distances and directions

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to extended buildings and boundaries

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
around the location where he parked.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And that would be represented

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Now both of these kinds of cells

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
can make the place cells fire.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And he can return to the location where he parked

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
by moving so as to find where it is

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
that best matches the firing pattern

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
of the place cells in his brain currently

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And that guides him back to that location

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
irrespective of visual cues

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
like whether his car's actually there.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Maybe it's been towed.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
So beyond spatial memory,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
if we look for this grid-like firing pattern

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
throughout the whole brain,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
we see it in a whole series of locations

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
which are always active

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
So it may be that the neural mechanisms

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
for representing the space around us

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.260
are also used for generating visual imagery

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
So if this was happening,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
your memories could start by place cells activating each other

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
via these dense interconnections

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and then reactivating boundary cells

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
to create the spatial structure

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
of the scene around your viewpoint.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Another kind of cell, head direction cells,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
which I didn't mention yet,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
They could define the viewing direction

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So this is just one example

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
of a new era really

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
in cognitive neuroscience

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
where we're beginning to understand

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
psychological processes

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
like how you remember or imagine or even think

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in terms of the actions

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Thank you very much.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
(Applause)
