00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.286
Well, Arthur C. Clarke,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.481
a famous science fiction
writer from the 1950s,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:21.503
said that, "We overestimate
technology in the short term,

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:24.303
and we underestimate it in the long term."

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:26.720
And I think that's some of the fear
that we see

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:31.302
about jobs disappearing from artificial
intelligence and robots.

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:34.136
That we're overestimating
the technology in the short term.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.347
But I am worried whether we're going to get
the technology we need in the long term.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:45.061
Because the demographics are really going
to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:50.436
and that we, our society, is going to have to be built
on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.262
So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:57.901
But fear of losing jobs to technology
has been around for a long time.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:01.853
Back in 1957, there was a Spencer
Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.

00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:03.301
So you know how it ended up,

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:07.387
Spencer Tracy brought a computer,
a mainframe computer of 1957, in

00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:09.287
to help the librarians.

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:12.978
The librarians in the company would do
things like answer for the executives,

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.601
"What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.959
And they would look that up.

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:20.392
And this mainframe computer was going
to help them with that job.

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:24.302
Well of course a mainframe computer
in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:27.452
The librarians were afraid
their jobs were going to disappear.

00:01:27.476 --> 00:01:29.238
But that's not what happened in fact.

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:34.356
The number of jobs for librarians
increased for a long time after 1957.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.470
It wasn't until the Internet
came into play,

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:40.161
the web came into play and search
engines came into play

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.652
that the need for librarians went down.

00:01:42.676 --> 00:01:46.859
And I think everyone from 1957
totally underestimated

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:51.619
the level of technology we would all carry
around in our hands and in our pockets today.

00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:57.336
And we can just ask: "What are the names
of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly --

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.087
or anything else we want to ask.

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:04.686
By the way, the wages
for librarians went up faster

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.996
than the wages for other jobs in the U.S.
over that same time period,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.253
because librarians became
partners of computers.

00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:14.136
Computers became tools, and they got
more tools that they could use

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.428
and become more effective
during that time.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:18.220
Same thing happened in offices.

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.518
Back in the old days,
people used spreadsheets.

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.852
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.002
and they calculated by hand.

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:27.407
But here was an interesting
thing that came along.

00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:29.659
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:34.401
the spreadsheet programs were
tuned for office workers,

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:36.053
not to replace office workers,

00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:40.719
but it respected office workers
as being capable of being programmers.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.847
So office workers became
programmers of spreadsheets.

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:45.938
It increased their capabilities.

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:48.517
They no longer had to do
the mundane computations,

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.452
but they could do something much more.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.710
Now today, we're starting
to see robots in our lives.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.019
On the left there
is the PackBot from iRobot.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:00.451
When soldiers came across roadside
bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:04.600
instead of putting on a bomb suit
and going out and poking with a stick,

00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:06.919
as they used to do up until about 2002,

00:03:06.943 --> 00:03:08.327
they now send the robot out.

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.470
So the robot takes
over the dangerous jobs.

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:14.988
On the right are some TUGs from a company
called Aethon in Pittsburgh.

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:17.393
These are in hundreds
of hospitals across the U.S.

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:20.025
And they take the dirty
sheets down to the laundry.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.901
They take the dirty dishes
back to the kitchen.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:24.116
They bring the medicines
up from the pharmacy.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.931
And it frees up the nurses
and the nurse's aides

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:30.596
from doing that mundane work of just
mechanically pushing stuff around

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.669
to spend more time with patients.

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:37.368
In fact, robots have become sort
of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:42.636
But I think when it comes to factory
robots, people are sort of afraid,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.743
because factory robots
are dangerous to be around.

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:51.568
In order to program them, you have to understand
six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:54.718
And ordinary people can't
interact with them.

00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:57.504
And I think it's the sort
of technology that's gone wrong.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.970
It's displaced the worker
from the technology.

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:04.069
And I think we really have
to look at technologies

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.171
that ordinary workers can interact with.

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.862
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter,
which we've been talking about.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:14.096
And Baxter, I see, as a way
-- a first wave of robot

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.386
that ordinary people can interact
with in an industrial setting.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.919
So Baxter is up here.

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:22.735
This is Chris Harbert
from Rethink Robotics.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.271
We've got a conveyor there.

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:27.122
And if the lighting isn't too extreme --

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:31.168
Ah, ah! There it is. It's picked
up the object off the conveyor.

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:34.017
It's going to come bring it
over here and put it down.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.317
And then it'll go back,
reach for another object.

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:41.165
The interesting thing is Baxter
has some basic common sense.

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.386
By the way, what's going on with the eyes?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.982
The eyes are on the screen there.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:47.635
The eyes look ahead where
the robot's going to move.

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.802
So a person that's interacting
with the robot

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:53.368
understands where it's going to reach
and isn't surprised by its motions.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:55.886
Here Chris took the object
out of its hand,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.118
and Baxter didn't go
and try to put it down;

00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:00.470
it went back and realized
it had to get another one.

00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:03.637
It's got a little bit of basic common
sense, goes and picks the objects.

00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:05.430
And Baxter's safe to interact with.

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:08.359
You wouldn't want to do this
with a current industrial robot.

00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:10.387
But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.285
It feels the force, understands
that Chris is there

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.137
and doesn't push through him and hurt him.

00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:20.685
But I think the most interesting thing
about Baxter is the user interface.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.778
And so Chris is going to come
and grab the other arm now.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:29.192
And when he grabs an arm, it goes
into zero-force gravity-compensated mode

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.268
and graphics come up on the screen.

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:35.802
You can see some icons on the left of the screen
there for what was about its right arm.

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:39.350
He's going to put something in its hand,
he's going to bring it over here,

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:43.618
press a button and let go
of that thing in the hand.

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:48.186
And the robot figures out, ah, he must
mean I want to put stuff down.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.886
It puts a little icon there.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.797
He comes over here, and he gets
the fingers to grasp together,

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:59.719
and the robot infers, ah, you
want an object for me to pick up.

00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:01.518
That puts the green icon there.

00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:06.513
He's going to map out an area of where
the robot should pick up the object from.

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:11.303
It just moves it around, and the robot
figures out that was an area search.

00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:13.327
He didn't have to select that from a menu.

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:16.923
And now he's going to go off and train
the visual appearance of that object

00:06:16.947 --> 00:06:18.491
while we continue talking.

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:20.264
So as we continue here,

00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:22.435
I want to tell you about what this
is like in factories.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:23.919
These robots we're shipping every day.

00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:25.848
They go to factories around the country.

00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:26.651
This is Mildred.

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:28.675
Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.054
She's worked on the line
for over 20 years.

00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:33.939
One hour after she saw her
first industrial robot,

00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:36.999
she had programmed it to do
some tasks in the factory.

00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:39.430
She decided she really liked robots.

00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:44.100
And it was doing the simple repetitive
tasks that she had had to do beforehand.

00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:45.938
Now she's got the robot doing it.

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:48.502
When we first went out to talk
to people in factories

00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:51.336
about how we could get robots
to interact with them better,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.218
one of the questions we asked them was,

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:55.663
"Do you want your children
to work in a factory?"

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:59.719
The universal answer was "No, I want
a better job than that for my children."

00:06:59.743 --> 00:07:03.096
And as a result of that,
Mildred is very typical

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.951
of today's factory workers in the U.S.

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:07.404
They're older, and they're
getting older and older.

00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:10.095
There aren't many young people
coming into factory work.

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.017
And as their tasks become
more onerous on them,

00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.110
we need to give them tools
that they can collaborate with,

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:18.087
so that they can be part of the solution,

00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.771
so that they can continue to work
and we can continue to produce in the U.S.

00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:26.836
And so our vision is that Mildred
who's the line worker

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.753
becomes Mildred the robot trainer.

00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:30.898
She lifts her game,

00:07:30.922 --> 00:07:35.485
like the office workers of the 1980s
lifted their game of what they could do.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:40.033
We're not giving them tools that they have to go
and study for years and years in order to use.

00:07:40.057 --> 00:07:43.477
They're tools that they can just learn
how to operate in a few minutes.

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:47.802
There's two great forces
that are both volitional but inevitable.

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:50.179
That's climate change and demographics.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.846
Demographics is really
going to change our world.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.808
This is the percentage
of adults who are working age.

00:07:56.832 --> 00:07:59.261
And it's gone down slightly
over the last 40 years.

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:03.141
But over the next 40 years, it's going
to change dramatically, even in China.

00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:07.978
The percentage of adults who are working
age drops dramatically.

00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:13.068
And turned up the other way, the people
who are retirement age goes up very, very fast,

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:17.405
as the baby boomers get to retirement age.

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:20.953
That means there will be more people
with fewer social security dollars

00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:23.586
competing for services.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.637
But more than that, as we get
older we get more frail

00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:29.886
and we can't do all the tasks
we used to do.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.599
If we look at the statistics
on the ages of caregivers,

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:38.069
before our eyes those caregivers
are getting older and older.

00:08:38.093 --> 00:08:40.068
That's happening statistically right now.

00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:46.006
And as the number of people who are older,
above retirement age and getting older, as they increase,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.269
there will be less people
to take care of them.

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:51.389
And I think we're really going
to have to have robots to help us.

00:08:51.413 --> 00:08:53.886
And I don't mean robots
in terms of companions.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.168
I mean robots doing the things
that we normally do for ourselves

00:08:57.192 --> 00:08:58.837
but get harder as we get older.

00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.242
Getting the groceries in from the car,
up the stairs, into the kitchen.

00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.097
Or even, as we get very much older,

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:07.185
driving our cars to go visit people.

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:13.552
And I think robotics gives people a chance
to have dignity as they get older

00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:17.101
by having control of the robotic solution.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.697
So they don't have to rely on people
that are getting scarcer to help them.

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:27.378
And so I really think that we're
going to be spending more time

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:29.679
with robots like Baxter

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:36.373
and working with robots like Baxter
in our daily lives. And that we will --

00:09:36.397 --> 00:09:38.853
Here, Baxter, it's good.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:43.097
And that we will all come to rely
on robots over the next 40 years

00:09:43.121 --> 00:09:45.263
as part of our everyday lives.

00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:46.557
Thanks very much.

00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:49.576
(Applause)
