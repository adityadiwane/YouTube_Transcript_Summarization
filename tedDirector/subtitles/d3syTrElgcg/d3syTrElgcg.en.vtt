00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Let me share with you today an original discovery.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
to something I'm calling biomutualism.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
Now, in terms of biomimetics,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
nature becomes a much more useful teacher.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Engineering can be inspired by biology

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
but then integrating that with the best human engineering,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.330
ultimately to make something actually better than nature.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
These are gecko toes.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
to climb up a wall so quickly.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
We discovered it. And what we found was

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
van der Waals forces.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
And I'm really pleased to report to you today

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.330
that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
From the simplest version in nature, one branch,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
had made the first synthetic version.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And so has my other incredible collaborator,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
he made much larger hairs than the gecko,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
but used the same general principles.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
And here is its first test.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.330
(Laughter)

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
professor now at Lewis and Clark,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
literally giving his first-born child up for this test.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.330
(Laughter)

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
More recently, this happened.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Man: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
Narrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
who appeared to be brimming with confidence.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
Lynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Man: How do you know?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Narrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
of Hollywood and science.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Man: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.330
Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Robert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
And you can try this in the lobby,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
and look at the gecko-inspired material.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Now the problem with the robots doing this

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
is that they can't get unstuck,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
with the material.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
from the surface, at high rates,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
as they run up the wall.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Well I'm really excited today to show you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
the newest version of a robot, Stickybot,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Here is the actual robot.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
And here is what it does.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
And if you look,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
you can see that it uses

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
the toe peeling,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
just like the gecko does.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
(Applause)

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
There it is.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
that the Stanford group was able to do

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
in designing this incredible robot.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
(Applause)

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
this kind of thing happens.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
The engineers told us, for the climbing robots,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
that, if they don't have a tail,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
they fall off the wall.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
So what they did was they asked us

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
an important question.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Even though we put a passive bar there.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
What they were doing was returning the favor,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
by giving us a hypothesis to test,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
So of course, in reality, we were then panicked,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
being the biologists, and we should know this already.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
We know that you can grab onto things with them.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
And perhaps it is most well known

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
that they provide static balance.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.330
(Laughter)

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
It can also act as a counterbalance.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So watch this kangaroo.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
See that tail? That's incredible!

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And it was unstable without its tail.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
like this human inside this dinosaur suit.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.330
(Laughter)

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.330
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
and running them through and obstacle course,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
and found a decrement in performance,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
like you'd predict.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
(Laughter)

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
But of course, this is a passive tail.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
And you can also have active tails.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
And when I went back to research this, I realized

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
that one of the great TED moments in the past,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
from Nathan,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
we've talked about an active tail.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
Video: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.330
were interested in love, not war.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
It can also be used in defense.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
Pretty powerful.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
So we then went back and looked at the animal.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And we ran it up a surface.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
that you see in yellow there.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.330
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
So here is normal speed.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
And watch it now slip,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
and see what it does with its tail.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
and it contributes to stability.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.330
If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
This is incredible.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
The engineers had a really good idea.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
And then of course we wondered,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
and there was some wind, or we shook it?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And we did that experiment, that you see here.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.330
(Applause)

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
And this is what we discovered.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
But there it is slowed down.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
righting response. But it's like a cat.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
But geckos do it better.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
And they do it with their tail.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
So for TED we actually built a robot,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
over there, a prototype, with the tail.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
in a tail, with a robot.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
If we could have the lights on it.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Okay, there it goes.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
And show the video.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
There it is.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
And it works just like it does in the animal.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
(Applause)

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Now, of course, we were normally frightened

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
because the animal has no gliding adaptations,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.330
just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.330
(Laughter)

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
So we did. And here is what it does.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.330
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.330
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
when you take a picture of it.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.330
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.330
and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
So we can maneuver this way.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
it also does this. Watch this.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
It can actually swim through the air.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.330
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
and trying to control a glide.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
Stay tuned for that.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
(Laughter)

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
And it certainly looks like it.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
You can see it even better from down on top.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
Watch the animal.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Definitely moving towards the landing target.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
It's unbelievable.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
So now we were really confused,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
because there are no reports of it gliding.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
and see if it actually does this."

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video --

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
Look at the end to see the animal.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
But then as it gets closer to the tree,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
It actually uses its tail too,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
just like we saw in the lab.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
So now we can continue this mutualism

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
by suggesting that they can make an active tail.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.330
And here is the first active tail, in the robot,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
made by Boston Dynamics.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.330
So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
we must preserve nature's designs,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
And from what I heard from our new president,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
I'm very optimistic. Thank you.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
(Applause)
