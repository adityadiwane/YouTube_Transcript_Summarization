00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
But you have to have the right tools.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
really frustrating for her little hands.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
So my wonderful student Sam and I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Play-Doh.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And so we spent a summer

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
looking at different Play-Doh recipes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And these recipes probably look really familiar

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
We have two favorite recipes --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
one that has these ingredients

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and a second that had sugar instead of salt.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
You see that really salty Play-Doh?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Well, it conducts electricity.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And this is nothing new.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and high school physics teachers have used that for years.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
But our homemade play-dough

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And that sugar dough?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
than that salt dough.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So what does that mean?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
can build on their own.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
(Applause)

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And so I want to do a little demo for you.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So if I take this salt dough,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and I plug it in --

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
you can buy them at Radio Shack

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and pretty much anywhere else --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
we can actually then

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
light things up.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
we can also create a short circuit.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
If I push these together, the light turns off.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
If I separate them again, I have some light.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Well now if I take that sugar dough,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It's like a wall to the electricity.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
but if I stick that light back in,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I have light.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
put some play-dough on it, stick it on

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and we have spinning.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
(Applause)

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And once you have the basics,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I plug in again the power to it.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I can start plugging in lots of lights.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
What happens if I put in lots of lights

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and then add a motor?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
It'll dim.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
We can even add microprocessors

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and have this as an input

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and create squishy sound music that we've done.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
You could do parallel and series circuits

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
for kids using this.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So this is all in your home kitchen.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to a science researcher in the U.K.,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and curriculum developers in Hawaii.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
or little kids as circuit designers,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
but maybe we should.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Have fun. Thank you.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.260
(Applause)
