00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.883
(Breathes in)

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:28.644
(Breathes out)

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:36.219
So, I didn't always make
my living from music.

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.123
For about the five years after graduating

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:42.252
from an upstanding
liberal arts university,

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.614
this was my day job.

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:46.339
(Laughter)

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:50.907
I was a self-employed living
statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.647
and I love telling people
I did this for a job,

00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:56.632
because everybody always wants to know,

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.611
who are these freaks in real life.

00:00:58.635 --> 00:00:59.636
(Laughter)

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.675
Hello.

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:04.307
I painted myself white
one day, stood on a box,

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.715
put a hat or a can at my feet,

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.066
and when someone came by
and dropped in money,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.751
I handed them a flower --

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.805
and some intense eye contact.

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:18.947
And if they didn't take the flower,

00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:22.041
I threw in a gesture
of sadness and longing --

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:24.502
as they walked away.

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.632
(Laughter)

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.871
So I had the most profound
encounters with people,

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.206
especially lonely people

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.555
who looked like they hadn't talked
to anyone in weeks,

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.548
and we would get this beautiful moment
of prolonged eye contact

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.865
being allowed in a city street,

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.510
and we would sort of fall
in love a little bit.

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.820
And my eyes would say --

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:54.693
"Thank you.

00:01:55.288 --> 00:01:56.288
I see you."

00:01:57.185 --> 00:01:58.540
And their eyes would say --

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:02.088
"Nobody ever sees me.

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:04.161
Thank you."

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.653
I would get harassed sometimes.

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:09.741
People would yell at me from their cars.

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:10.827
"Get a job!"

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:13.447
(Laughing) And I'd be, like,

00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.604
"This is my job."

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:19.010
But it hurt, because it made me fear

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:23.268
that I was somehow doing
something un-joblike

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.200
and unfair, shameful.

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:31.255
I had no idea how perfect
a real education I was getting

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.391
for the music business on this box.

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:35.587
And for the economists out there,

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.192
you may be interested to know I actually
made a pretty predictable income,

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:43.407
which was shocking to me,
given I had no regular customers,

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.695
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
90 bucks on a Friday.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.980
It was consistent.

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.464
And meanwhile, I was touring locally
and playing in nightclubs

00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:53.326
with my band, the Dresden Dolls.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.424
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.337
I wrote the songs, and eventually

00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.723
we started making enough money
that I could quit being a statue,

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.984
and as we started touring,

00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:06.358
I really didn't want to lose this sense

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:09.058
of direct connection with people,
because I loved it.

00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:13.013
So after all of our shows,
we would sign autographs

00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:15.925
and hug fans and hang out
and talk to people,

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:21.617
and we made an art out
of asking people to help us and join us,

00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:24.763
and I would track down
local musicians and artists

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.955
and they would set up
outside of our shows,

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.443
and they would pass the hat,

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.943
and then they would come in
and join us onstage,

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:35.352
so we had this rotating smorgasbord
of weird, random circus guests.

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:38.456
And then Twitter came along,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.512
and made things even more magic,

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.271
because I could ask instantly
for anything anywhere.

00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:45.336
So I would need a piano to practice on,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.629
and an hour later I would be
at a fan's house.

00:03:47.653 --> 00:03:48.690
This is in London.

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:51.174
People would bring home-cooked food to us

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.913
all over the world backstage
and feed us and eat with us.

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:55.319
This is in Seattle.

00:03:55.343 --> 00:03:58.946
Fans who worked in museums and stores

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.153
and any kind of public space
would wave their hands

00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:05.417
if I would decide to do
a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.

00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.053
This is a library in Auckland.

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:13.317
On Saturday I tweeted
for this crate and hat,

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:16.100
because I did not want to schlep them
from the East Coast,

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:19.147
and they showed up care of this dude,
Chris, from Newport Beach,

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.302
who says hello.

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:24.586
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne
can I buy a neti pot?"

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.116
And a nurse from a hospital drove one

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.387
right at that moment to the cafe I was in,

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:30.855
and I bought her a smoothie

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.419
and we sat there talking
about nursing and death.

00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:36.474
And I love this kind of random closeness,

00:04:36.498 --> 00:04:39.855
which is lucky, because I do
a lot of couchsurfing.

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:44.278
In mansions where everyone
in my crew gets their own room

00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:45.555
but there's no wireless,

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:47.111
and in punk squats,

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.073
everyone on the floor
in one room with no toilets

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:53.092
but with wireless,
clearly making it the better option.

00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:55.672
(Laughter)

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.325
My crew once pulled our van
up to a really poor Miami neighborhood

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.031
and we found out that our couchsurfing
host for the night

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.618
was an 18-year-old girl,
still living at home,

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:11.745
and her family were all undocumented
immigrants from Honduras.

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:15.642
And that night, her whole family

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:18.719
took the couches and she slept
together with her mom

00:05:18.743 --> 00:05:20.473
so that we could take their beds.

00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:24.115
And I lay there thinking,

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.838
these people have so little.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.139
Is this fair?

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:30.346
And in the morning,

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.693
her mom taught us
how to try to make tortillas

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:34.694
and wanted to give me a Bible,

00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:40.287
and she took me aside and she said
to me in her broken English,

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:44.765
"Your music has helped
my daughter so much.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:48.480
Thank you for staying here.
We're all so grateful."

00:05:49.154 --> 00:05:52.708
And I thought, this is fair.

00:05:53.438 --> 00:05:55.567
This is this.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:59.485
A couple of months later,
I was in Manhattan,

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.773
and I tweeted for a crash pad,
and at midnight,

00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:03.575
I'm on the Lower East Side,

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.368
and it occurs to me I've never
actually done this alone.

00:06:06.392 --> 00:06:08.345
I've always been with my band or my crew.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:10.207
Is this what stupid people do?

00:06:10.674 --> 00:06:11.674
(Laughter)

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.141
Is this how stupid people die?

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:17.129
And before I can change my mind,
the door busts open.

00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:18.184
She's an artist.

00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:20.528
He's a financial blogger for Reuters,

00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:22.566
and they're pouring me a glass of red wine

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.737
and offering me a bath,

00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:28.094
and I have had thousands of nights
like that and like that.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.717
So I couchsurf a lot.
I also crowdsurf a lot.

00:06:33.108 --> 00:06:36.045
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.979
are basically the same thing.

00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:40.798
You're falling into the audience

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:42.338
and you're trusting each other.

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.953
I once asked an opening band of mine

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:47.644
if they wanted to go out
into the crowd and pass the hat

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:50.358
to get some extra money,
something that I did a lot.

00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:52.170
And as usual, the band was psyched,

00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:54.368
but there was this one guy in the band

00:06:54.392 --> 00:06:58.250
who told me he just couldn't
bring himself to go out there.

00:06:58.274 --> 00:07:01.964
It felt too much like begging
to stand there with the hat.

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:06.088
And I recognized his fear

00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:08.201
of "Is this fair?"

00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:09.563
and "Get a job."

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:14.092
And meanwhile, my band
is becoming bigger and bigger.

00:07:14.116 --> 00:07:15.645
We sign with a major label.

00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.185
And our music is a cross
between punk and cabaret.

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:20.591
It's not for everybody.

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:23.042
Well, maybe it's for you.

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.150
(Laughter)

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:28.970
We sign, and there's all this hype
leading up to our next record.

00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:32.663
And it comes out and it sells
about 25,000 copies

00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:33.976
in the first few weeks,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.880
and the label considers this a failure.

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:39.857
I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"

00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:41.849
They said, "No, the sales are going down.

00:07:41.873 --> 00:07:42.889
It's a failure."

00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:43.928
And they walk off.

00:07:44.838 --> 00:07:48.198
Right at this same time,
I'm signing and hugging after a gig,

00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:49.989
and a guy comes up to me

00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:52.191
and hands me a $10 bill,

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:53.872
and he says,

00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:56.276
"I'm sorry, I burned
your CD from a friend."

00:07:56.738 --> 00:08:00.621
(Laughter)

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:04.087
"But I read your blog,
I know you hate your label.

00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:05.894
I just want you to have this money."

00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.930
And this starts happening all the time.

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:13.926
I become the hat after my own gigs,

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.212
but I have to physically stand there
and take the help from people,

00:08:17.236 --> 00:08:19.421
and unlike the guy in the opening band,

00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:22.239
I've actually had a lot
of practice standing there.

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:25.112
Thank you.

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:27.718
And this is the moment I decide

00:08:27.742 --> 00:08:30.610
I'm just going to give away
my music for free

00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:32.342
online whenever possible,

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.828
so it's like Metallica
over here, Napster, bad;

00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:37.518
Amanda Palmer over here,

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:40.817
and I'm going to encourage
torrenting, downloading, sharing,

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.939
but I'm going to ask for help,

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:45.666
because I saw it work on the street.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.163
So I fought my way off my label,
and for my next project

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:51.867
with my new band,
the Grand Theft Orchestra,

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.601
I turned to crowdfunding.

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:58.763
And I fell into those thousands
of connections that I'd made,

00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:00.894
and I asked my crowd to catch me.

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:04.894
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.

00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:08.433
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,

00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:11.339
which was the biggest music
crowdfunding project to date.

00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:15.427
(Applause)

00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.777
And you can see how many people it is.

00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:21.610
It's about 25,000 people.

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:24.969
And the media asked,

00:09:24.993 --> 00:09:28.447
"Amanda, the music business is tanking
and you encourage piracy.

00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:30.805
How did you make
all these people pay for music?"

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:33.190
And the real answer is,
I didn't make them.

00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:34.658
I asked them.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:39.356
And through the very act of asking people,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.072
I'd connected with them,

00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:44.946
and when you connect with them,
people want to help you.

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:50.001
It's kind of counterintuitive
for a lot of artists.

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.691
They don't want to ask for things.

00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:55.368
But it's not easy.

00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:56.859
It's not easy to ask.

00:09:57.376 --> 00:09:59.558
And a lot of artists have
a problem with this.

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:01.281
Asking makes you vulnerable.

00:10:01.873 --> 00:10:06.397
And I got a lot of criticism online,

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.018
after my Kickstarter went big,

00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:10.977
for continuing my crazy
crowdsourcing practices,

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.858
specifically for asking musicians

00:10:13.882 --> 00:10:16.231
who are fans if they wanted
to join us on stage

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:20.546
for a few songs in exchange
for love and tickets and beer,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:25.070
and this was a doctored image
that went up of me on a website.

00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:28.485
And this hurt in a really familiar way.

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:30.918
And people saying,

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:33.971
"You're not allowed anymore
to ask for that kind of help,"

00:10:33.995 --> 00:10:38.191
really reminded me of the people
in their cars yelling, "Get a job."

00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:43.212
Because they weren't
with us on the sidewalk,

00:10:43.236 --> 00:10:46.469
and they couldn't see the exchange

00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:48.541
that was happening
between me and my crowd,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:52.898
an exchange that was very fair
to us but alien to them.

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:56.231
So this is slightly not safe for work.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.818
This is my Kickstarter
backer party in Berlin.

00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:01.875
At the end of the night, I stripped
and let everyone draw on me.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:04.892
Now let me tell you,
if you want to experience

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:07.387
the visceral feeling
of trusting strangers --

00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:08.858
(Laughter)

00:11:08.882 --> 00:11:10.073
I recommend this,

00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:13.440
especially if those strangers
are drunk German people.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.375
(Laughter)

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:19.219
This was a ninja
master-level fan connection,

00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:21.739
because what I was really saying here was,

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.307
I trust you this much.

00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:25.476
Should I?

00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:27.244
Show me.

00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:30.495
For most of human history,

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:34.574
musicians, artists, they've been
part of the community.

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:39.520
Connectors and openers,
not untouchable stars.

00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:44.412
Celebrity is about a lot of people
loving you from a distance,

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:45.581
but the Internet

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:49.206
and the content that we're freely
able to share on it

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.507
are taking us back.

00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:55.688
It's about a few people
loving you up close

00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:58.962
and about those people being enough.

00:12:00.263 --> 00:12:02.390
So a lot of people
are confused by the idea

00:12:02.414 --> 00:12:03.705
of no hard sticker price.

00:12:03.729 --> 00:12:06.927
They see it as an unpredictable risk,
but the things I've done,

00:12:06.951 --> 00:12:09.339
the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:11.193
I don't see these things as risk.

00:12:11.217 --> 00:12:12.517
I see them as trust.

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:15.329
Now, the online tools

00:12:15.353 --> 00:12:20.101
to make the exchange as easy
and as instinctive as the street,

00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.323
they're getting there.

00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:25.438
But the perfect tools
aren't going to help us

00:12:25.462 --> 00:12:27.906
if we can't face each other

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.965
and give and receive fearlessly,

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:32.188
but, more important --

00:12:33.891 --> 00:12:36.373
to ask without shame.

00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:39.836
My music career has been spent

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.409
trying to encounter people on the Internet
the way I could on the box.

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:48.751
So blogging and tweeting
not just about my tour dates

00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:52.342
and my new video
but about our work and our art

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:55.483
and our fears and our hangovers,

00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:56.925
our mistakes,

00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:58.410
and we see each other.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.794
And I think when we really see each other,

00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:04.674
we want to help each other.

00:13:07.023 --> 00:13:10.162
I think people have been obsessed
with the wrong question,

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:13.074
which is, "How do we make
people pay for music?"

00:13:14.082 --> 00:13:16.886
What if we started asking,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.924
"How do we let people pay for music?"

00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:22.936
Thank you.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.960
(Applause)
