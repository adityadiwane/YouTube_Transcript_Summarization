00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want you to take a trip with me.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Picture yourself driving

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
down a small road in Africa,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and as you drive along, you look off to the side,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and this is what you see:

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
you see a field of graves.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And you go into the town,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and you inquire, "What's going on here?"

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And then someone says,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
HIV isn't like other medical conditions;

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
it's stigmatizing.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
People are reluctant to talk about it --

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
there's a fear associated with it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And I'm going to talk about HIV today,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
about the deaths,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
about the stigma.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And as you can see,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
There are 33 million people

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
living with HIV in the world today.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
are living in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
There are 1.4 million pregnant women

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and of these, 90 percent

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
are in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
We talk about things in relative terms.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and HIV-positive mothers.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
The United States -- a large country --

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
who give birth to a child.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
outside of Johannesburg in South Africa,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
giving birth --

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
a hospital the same as a country.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
that when you compare

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
everything here to South Africa, it just pales,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because in South Africa,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
each year 300,000 mothers with HIV

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
give birth to children.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
So we talk about PMTCT,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
that if a mother is HIV-positive,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
she's going to infect her child.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
The reality is really, very different.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
In resource-rich countries,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
with all the tests and treatment we currently have,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive --

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
in the absence of tests and treatment,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected --

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
40 percent versus two percent --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
an enormous difference.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So these programs --

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
these prevention programs,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to prevent them from infecting their babies,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and also the medicines we give to mothers

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
It's the drugs she receives

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and safer sex.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
It's an entire package of services,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and it works.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So in the United States,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
there's been an 80-percent decline

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
in the number of HIV-infected children.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
each year in the United States

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and yet, still,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
over 400,000 children

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
are born every year in the world today with HIV.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
What does that mean?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
It means 1,100 children infected each day --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And where do they come from?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Well, less than one comes from the United States.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
One, on average, comes from Europe.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And each day,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
a thousand babies -- a thousand babies

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
are born each day with HIV in Africa.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So again, I look at the globe here

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And let's look at another map.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And here, again, we see

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And it's the same with nurses.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
has 24 percent

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
of the global disease burden

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
That means doctors and nurses

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
simply don't have the time to take care of patients.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
A nurse in a busy clinic

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
will see 50 to 100 patients in a day,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
which leaves her just minutes per patient --

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
minutes per patient.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Well, back in 2001,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
when there was just a simple test

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and a single dose of a drug,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and test the baby -- in minutes.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Well, fortunately since 2001,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
we've got new treatments, new tests,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and we're far more successful,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
but we don't have any more nurses.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And so these are the tests

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
a nurse now has to do

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in those same few minutes.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It's not possible --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
it doesn't work.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And so we need to find

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
better ways of providing care.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
These women are here for care,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
but we know that just doing a test,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
just giving someone a drug,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
it's not enough.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Meds don't equal medical care.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Doctors and nurses, frankly,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
don't have the time or skills

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to tell people what to do in ways they understand.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and I expect them to follow my guidance --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
but the reality is,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
You should always use a condom,"

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
what's going to happen?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
If I tell her to take her medicines every day

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
it's just not going to work.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And so we need to do more,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
we need to do it differently,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
we need to do it in ways that are affordable

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and accessible and can be taken to scale,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
which means it can be done everywhere.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So, I want to tell you a story --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
I want to take you on a little trip.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Imagine yourself, if you can,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
You go in for a test

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And then they give you another test

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And the nurse takes you into a room,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and she tells you about the tests

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and HIV and the medicines you can take

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and how to take care of yourself and your baby,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and you hear none of it.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and my baby is going to die."

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And you don't know who you can talk to,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
you're likely to be thrown out

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
without any means of support.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And this -- this is the face and story

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of HIV in Africa today.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
But we're here to talk about possible solutions

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and some good news.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And I want to change the story a little bit.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
takes her to a room.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
"Welcome to mothers2mothers.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Have a seat. You're safe here.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
We're all HIV-positive.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
You're going to be okay. You're going to live.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative."

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
We view mothers

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
as a community's single greatest resource.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So often the men are gone.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
They're working, or they're not part of the household.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Our organization, mothers2mothers,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
enlists women with HIV

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
as care providers.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We bring mothers who have HIV,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
who've been through these PMTCT programs

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
in the very facilities,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
as part of the health care team.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
are able to engage women

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
have found out about being HIV-positive,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
who need support and education.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And they support them around the diagnosis

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and educate them about how to take their medicines,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
how to take care of themselves,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
how to take care of their babies.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Consider: if you needed surgery,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
But if you wanted to understand

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
what that surgery would do to your life,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
you'd like to engage someone,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
someone who's had the procedure.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Patients are experts on their own experience,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and they can share that experience with others.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So the mothers who work for us,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
they come from the communities in which they work.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
just like doctors and nurses.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And we open bank accounts for them

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and they're paid directly into the accounts,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
because their money's protected;

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
the men can't take it away from them.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
They go through two to three weeks

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
But so often, they only get trained once,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
so they're not aware of new medicines,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
new guidelines as they come out.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and retrained.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And so doctors and nurses --

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
they look up to them as experts.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Imagine that: a woman, a former patient,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
being able to educate her doctor for the first time

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
and educate the other patients

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that she's taking care of.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Our organization has three goals.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
keep the children alive --

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
no more orphans.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
And the third, and maybe the most grand,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
is to find ways to empower women,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
enable them to fight the stigma

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So how do we do it?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Well, maybe the most important engagement

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
is the one-to-one,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
explaining how they can take care of themselves.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
We go beyond that;

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
But in Rwanda, in one country,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
they've got a policy

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
that a woman can't come for care

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
unless she brings the father of the baby with her --

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
that's the rule.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And so the father and the mother, together,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
go through the counseling and the testing.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Disclosure is so central to prevention.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
if there hasn't been disclosure?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Disclosure is so important to treatment,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
because again, people need the support of family members and friends

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
to take their medicines regularly.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
We also work in groups.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
but what happens is women, they come together --

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers --

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
they come together, and they share their personal experiences.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And it's through the sharing

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
how to disclose how to take medicines.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And then there's the community outreach,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
engaging women in their communities.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
If we can change the way

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
households believe and think,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
we can change the way communities believe and think.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And if we can change enough communities,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
we can change national attitudes.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We can change national attitudes to women

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and national attitudes to HIV.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
We have the medicines, we have the tests,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
but how do you reduce the stigma?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And it's important about disclosure.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and she told me a story.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
She had been asked by one of the clients

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
to go to the home of the client,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
about her HIV status,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and she was afraid to go by herself.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And so the mentor mother went along with.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
And the patient walked into the house

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and said to her mother and siblings,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
And everybody was quiet.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And then her oldest brother stood up and said,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
"I too have something to tell you.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
I'm HIV-positive.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
I've been afraid to tell everybody."

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And then this older sister stood up and said,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
"I too am living with the virus,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and I've been ashamed."

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And then her younger brother stood up and said,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
"I'm also positive.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And you see where this is going.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
I thought you were going to hate me."

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And there they were, all of them together for the first time

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
being able to share this experience for the first time

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and to support each other for the first time.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and they are crying and scared.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
I tell them my story,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
that I am HIV-positive,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
but my child is HIV-negative.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
I tell them, "You are going to make it,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and you will raise a healthy baby."

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
I am proof that there is hope.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And it is a crisis in health care systems.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Even as we have more tests and more drugs,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Task-shifting is traditionally

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
when you take health care services from one provider

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
and have another provider do it.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And the issue in Africa

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
How do you build a better health care system?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
We've chosen to redefine the health care system

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And so what nurses do

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
how to take the drugs, the side effects.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
They delegate education about infant feeding,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
family planning, safer sex,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
actions that nurses simple just don't have time for.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
The world is increasingly seeing these programs

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And our organization

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
helps women across that bridge.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born --

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
ensuring that they live healthy,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
successful lives.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Our organization works on three levels.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
The first, at the patient level --

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
keeping mothers healthy to raise them.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
The second, communities --

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
empowering women.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
They become leaders within their communities.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
They change the way communities think --

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
we need to change attitudes to HIV.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
We have to do that.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And then rework the level of the health care systems,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
building stronger health care systems.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Our health care systems are broken.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And so doctors and nurses

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
who need to try to change people's behaviors

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
don't have the skills, don't have the time --

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
our mentor mothers do.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
we can do that.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
back in 2001.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
on where ideas come from,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
I was in the shower at the time --

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
I was alone.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.260
(Laughter)

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
The program is now working in nine countries,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
we have 670 program sites,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
we're seeing about 230,000

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
women every month,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and last year, they enrolled

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
That is 20 percent

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
of the global HIV-positive pregnant women --

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
20 percent of the world.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Past patients taking care of present patients.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
And empowerment through employment --

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
reducing stigma.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
hope that one day

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
we shall win this fight

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
against HIV and AIDS.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Each person must know

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
their HIV status.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Those who are HIV-negative

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
must know how to stay negative.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
Those who are HIV-infected

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
must know how

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
to take care of themselves.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
HIV-positive pregnant women

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
must get PMTCT services

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
in order to have

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
HIV-negative babies.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
All of this is possible,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
if we each contribute to this fight.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
MB: Simple solutions to complex problems.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
Mothers caring for mothers.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
It's transformational.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
Thank you.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
(Applause)
