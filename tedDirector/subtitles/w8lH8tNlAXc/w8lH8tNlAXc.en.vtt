00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.280
Here's a question that matters.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.856
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.376
Because we're beginning to get all
the tools together to evolve ourselves.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.816
And we can evolve bacteria
and we can evolve plants

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.256
and we can evolve animals,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.096
and we're now reaching a point
where we really have to ask,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.960
is it really ethical
and do we want to evolve human beings?

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.336
And as you're thinking about that,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.096
let me talk about that
in the context of prosthetics,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.800
prosthetics past, present, future.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.496
So this is the iron hand

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.856
that belonged to one of the German counts.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.296
Loved to fight, lost his arm
in one of these battles.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.776
No problem, he just made a suit of armor,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.136
put it on,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.416
perfect prosthetic.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.360
That's where the concept
of ruling with an iron fist comes from.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.056
And of course these prosthetics
have been getting more and more useful,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.336
more and more modern.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.816
You can hold soft-boiled eggs.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.336
You can have all types of controls,
and as you're thinking about that,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.376
there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.239
who have been building
absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.536
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins
will go out and say,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.240
how tall do I want to be tonight?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.936
Or Hugh will say what type of cliff
do I want to climb?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.456
Or does somebody want to run a marathon,
or does somebody want to ballroom dance?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.456
And as you adapt these things,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.616
the interesting thing about prosthetics
is they've been coming inside the body.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.616
So these external prosthetics
have now become artificial knees.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.696
They've become artificial hips.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.936
And then they've evolved further

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.976
to become not just nice to have

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.200
but essential to have.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.776
So when you're talking
about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.496
you're talking about something
that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,"

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.936
it's, "if I don't have this, I can die."

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.056
And at that point, a prosthetic
becomes a symbiotic relationship

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.280
with the human body.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.096
And four of the smartest people
that I've ever met --

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.376
Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,
Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.976
are working on a Center
for Extreme Bionics.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.616
And the interesting thing
of what you're seeing here is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.056
these prosthetics
now get integrated into the bone.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.735
They get integrated into the skin.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.475
They get integrated into the muscle.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.336
And one of the other sides of Ed

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.256
is he's been thinking
about how to connect the brain

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.976
using light or other mechanisms

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.280
directly to things like these prosthetics.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.776
And if you can do that,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000
then you can begin changing
fundamental aspects of humanity.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.840
So how quickly you react to something
depends on the diameter of a nerve.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.800
And of course, if you have nerves
that are external or prosthetic,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.480
say with light or liquid metal,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.976
then you can increase that diameter

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.056
and you could even increase it
theoretically to the point where,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.120
as long as you could see the muzzle flash,
you could step out of the way of a bullet.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.960
Those are the order of magnitude
of changes you're talking about.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.776
This is a fourth
sort of level of prosthetics.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.336
These are Phonak hearing aids,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.416
and the reason
why these are so interesting

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.856
is because they cross the threshold
from where prosthetics are something

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.309
for somebody who is "disabled"

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.616
and they become something
that somebody who is "normal"

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.536
might want to actually have,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.536
because what this prosthetic does,
which is really interesting,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.216
is not only does it help you hear,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.576
you can focus your hearing,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.056
so it can hear the conversation
going on over there.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.336
You can have superhearing.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.296
You can have hearing in 360 degrees.
You can have white noise.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.520
You can record, and oh, by the way,
they also put a phone into this.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.320
So this functions as your hearing aid
and also as your phone.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.080
And at that point, somebody might actually
want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.096
All of these thousands
of loosely connected little pieces

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.320
are coming together,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.056
and it's about time we ask the question,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.240
how do we want to evolve human beings
over the next century or two?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.680
And for that we turn
to a great philosopher

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.976
who was a very smart man
despite being a Yankee fan.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880
(Laughter)

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.616
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course,
that it's very tough to make predictions,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.016
especially about the future.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.136
(Laughter)

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.216
So instead of making a prediction
about the future to begin with,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.576
let's take what's happening in the present
with people like Tony Atala,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.839
who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.776
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic
isn't having something external, titanium.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.496
Maybe the ultimate prosthetic
is take your own gene code,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.840
remake your own body parts,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.520
because that's a whole lot more effective
than any kind of a prosthetic.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.456
But while you're at it, then you can take
the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.536
And one of the things
that we've been doing

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.120
is trying to figure out
how to reprogram cells.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.856
And if you can reprogram a cell,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.120
then you can change the cells
in those organs.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.616
So if you can change
the cells in those organs,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.136
maybe you make those organs
more radiation-resistant.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.056
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.736
Maybe you make them more efficient

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240
to filter out stuff
that you don't want in your body.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.096
And over the last few weeks,
George Church has been in the news a lot

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.416
because he's been talking about taking
one of these programmable cells

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.176
and inserting an entire human genome

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.400
into that cell.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.296
And once you can insert
an entire human genome into a cell,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.456
then you begin to ask the question,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.160
would you want
to enhance any of that genome?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.776
Do you want to enhance a human body?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.096
How would you want
to enhance a human body?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.216
Where is it ethical
to enhance a human body

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.496
and where is it not ethical
to enhance a human body?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.416
And all of a sudden, what we're doing

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.376
is we've got this
multidimensional chess board

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.656
where we can change
human genetics by using viruses

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.120
to attack things like AIDS,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.536
or we can change the gene code
through gene therapy

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.496
to do away with some hereditary diseases,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.136
or we can change the environment,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.827
and change the expression
of those genes in the epigenome

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:05.811
and pass that on to the next generations.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.456
And all of a sudden,
it's not just one little bit,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.336
it's all these stacked little bits

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.440
that allow you
to take little portions of it

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280
until all the portions coming together

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.240
lead you to something
that's very different.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.336
And a lot of people
are very scared by this stuff.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.280
And it does sound scary,
and there are risks to this stuff.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.736
So why in the world would you
ever want to do this stuff?

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.776
Why would we really want
to alter the human body

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.000
in a fundamental way?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.336
The answer lies in part

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.560
with Lord Rees,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.920
astronomer royal of Great Britain.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.376
And one of his favorite sayings
is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.616
So what does that mean?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.536
It means if you take
any one of your bodies at random,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.456
drop it anywhere in the universe,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.200
drop it in space, you die.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.096
Drop it on the Sun, you die.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.136
Drop it on the surface
of Mercury, you die.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.800
Drop it near a supernova, you die.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360
But fortunately, it's only
about 80 percent effective.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.680
So as a great physicist once said,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.136
there's these little
upstream eddies of biology

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.800
that create order
in this rapid torrent of entropy.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.056
So as the universe dissipates energy,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.560
there's these upstream eddies
that create biological order.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.376
Now, the problem with eddies is,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.896
they tend to disappear.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.800
They shift. They move in rivers.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.656
And because of that, when an eddy shifts,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.216
when the Earth becomes a snowball,
when the Earth becomes very hot,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.496
when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,
when you have supervolcanoes,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.376
when you have solar flares,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.736
when you have potentially
extinction-level events

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.976
like the next election --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.160
(Laughter)

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.680
then all of a sudden,
you can have periodic extinctions.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.840
And by the way, that's happened
five times on Earth,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.456
and therefore it is very likely

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.520
that the human species on Earth
is going to go extinct someday.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.936
Not next week,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.776
not next month,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.680
maybe in November,
but maybe 10,000 years after that.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.696
As you're thinking
of the consequence of that,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.136
if you believe that extinctions
are common and natural

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.456
and normal and occur periodically,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.360
it becomes a moral imperative
to diversify our species.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.136
And it becomes a moral imperative

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.136
because it's going to be
really hard to live on Mars

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.880
if we don't fundamentally
modify the human body.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.096
Right?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.456
You go from one cell,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.696
mom and dad coming together
to make one cell,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.896
in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.376
We don't know, if you change
the gravity substantially,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.880
if the same thing will happen
to create your body.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:53.216
We do know that if you expose
our bodies as they currently are

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.360
to a lot of radiation, we will die.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.096
So as you're thinking of that,
you have to really redesign things

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.376
just to get to Mars.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.320
Forget about the moons
of Neptune or Jupiter.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.456
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.656
let's think about life
in a series of scales.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.176
So Life One civilization

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
is a civilization that begins
to alter his or her looks.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.376
And we've been doing that
for thousands of years.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.560
You've got tummy tucks
and you've got this and you've got that.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.696
You alter your looks, and I'm told

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.040
that not all of those alterations
take place for medical reasons.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.736
(Laughter)

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.960
Seems odd.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.880
A Life Two civilization
is a different civilization.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.880
A Life Two civilization alters
fundamental aspects of the body.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.696
So you put human growth hormone in,
the person grows taller,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.656
or you put x in and the person
gets fatter or loses metabolism

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.296
or does a whole series of things,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.016
but you're altering the functions
in a fundamental way.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.656
To become an intrasolar civilization,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.400
we're going to have to create
a Life Three civilization,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.320
and that looks very different
from what we've got here.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.056
Maybe you splice in
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.200
so that the cells can resplice
after a lot of exposure to radiation.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.336
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen
flow through your blood

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.800
instead of through your lungs.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.320
But you're talking about
really radical redesigns,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.696
and one of the interesting things
that's happened in the last decade

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.456
is we've discovered
a whole lot of planets out there.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.160
And some of them may be Earth-like.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.056
The problem is, if we ever
want to get to these planets,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.736
the fastest human objects --

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.336
Juno and Voyager
and the rest of this stuff --

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.856
take tens of thousands of years

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.000
to get from here
to the nearest solar system.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.680
So if you want to start exploring
beaches somewhere else,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.800
or you want to see two-sun sunsets,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.976
then you're talking
about something that is very different,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.056
because you have to change
the timescale and the body of humans

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.000
in ways which may be
absolutely unrecognizable.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.840
And that's a Life Four civilization.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.656
Now, we can't even begin
to imagine what that might look like,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.016
but we're beginning to get glimpses

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.400
of instruments that might
take us even that far.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.576
And let me give you two examples.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.553
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.336
and one of the things
that Floyd's been doing

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.896
is he's been playing
with the basic chemistry of life.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.776
So all life on this planet
is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.936
All bacteria, all plants,
all animals, all humans, all cows,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.160
everything else.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.616
And what Floyd did is he changed out
two of those base pairs,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.160
so it's ATXY.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.456
And that means that you now have
a parallel system to make life,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.776
to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.976
that doesn't mate
with most things on Earth

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.880
or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.416
Maybe you make plants
that are immune to all bacteria.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.936
Maybe you make plants
that are immune to all viruses.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.496
But why is that so interesting?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.680
It means that we
are not a unique solution.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.136
It means you can create
alternate chemistries to us

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.976
that could be chemistries
adaptable to a very different planet

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.360
that could create life and heredity.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.360
The second experiment,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.560
or the other implication
of this experiment,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.576
is that all of you, all life
is based on 20 amino acids.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.056
If you don't substitute two amino acids,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.656
if you don't say ATXY,
if you say ATCG + XY,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.440
then you go from
20 building blocks to 172,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.656
and all of a sudden you've got
172 building blocks of amino acids

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.480
to build life-forms
in very different shapes.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.536
The second experiment to think about
is a really weird experiment

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.640
that's been taking place in China.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.960
So this guy has been transplanting
hundreds of mouse heads.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.296
Right?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.400
And why is that an interesting experiment?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.496
Well, think of the first
heart transplants.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.136
One of the things they used to do

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.696
is they used to bring in
the wife or the daughter of the donor

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.616
so the donee could tell the doctors,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.256
"Do you recognize this person?
Do you love this person?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.136
Do you feel anything for this person?"

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.640
We laugh about that today.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.776
We laugh because we know
the heart is a muscle,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.296
but for hundreds of thousands of years,
or tens of thousands of years,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.216
"I gave her my heart.
She took my heart. She broke my heart."

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.616
We thought this was emotion

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.880
and we thought maybe emotions
were transplanted with the heart. Nope.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.480
So how about the brain?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.120
Two possible outcomes to this experiment.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.296
If you can get a mouse

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.936
that is functional,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.160
then you can see,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.640
is the new brain a blank slate?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.320
And boy, does that have implications.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.320
Second option:

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.920
the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.856
The new mouse
remembers what it's afraid of,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.576
remembers how to navigate the maze,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.800
and if that is true,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.360
then you can transplant
memory and consciousness.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.496
And then the really
interesting question is,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.456
if you can transplant this,
is the only input-output mechanism

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.680
this down here?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.136
Or could you transplant
that consciousness into something

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.136
that would be very different,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.416
that would last in space,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.496
that would last
tens of thousands of years,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.520
that would be a completely redesigned body

00:14:31.544 --> 00:14:35.224
that could hold consciousness
for a long, long period of time?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.080
And let's come back to the first question:

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.440
Why would you ever want to do that?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.576
Well, I'll tell you why.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.320
Because this is the ultimate selfie.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.800
(Laughter)

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.000
This is taken from six billion miles away,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.240
and that's Earth.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.000
And that's all of us.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.760
And if that little thing goes,
all of humanity goes.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.536
And the reason you want
to alter the human body

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.336
is because you eventually
want a picture that says,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.296
that's us, and that's us,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.736
and that's us,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.880
because that's the way humanity
survives long-term extinction.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.696
And that's the reason why it turns out

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.656
it's actually unethical
not to evolve the human body

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.016
even though it can be scary,
even though it can be challenging,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.416
but it's what's going
to allow us to explore, live

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.960
and get to places
we can't even dream of today,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.496
but which our great-great-great-great-
grandchildren might someday.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.736
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.280
(Applause)
