00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:16.140
Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.382
and it comes in part from a deep dilemma

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:22.070
in which it is embedded.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.817
It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.342
we face that have to do with global pandemics,

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:31.451
a cross-border problem;

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.874
with HIV, a transnational problem;

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:36.949
with markets and immigration,

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.503
something that goes beyond national borders;

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:41.776
with terrorism, with war,

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:44.423
all now cross-border problems.

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:48.178
In fact, we live in a 21st-century world

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:50.383
of interdependence,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.906
and brutal interdependent problems,

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:59.550
and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.738
we are faced with political institutions

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:06.191
designed 400 years ago,

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:10.669
autonomous, sovereign nation-states

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.231
with jurisdictions and territories

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.990
separate from one another,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.923
each claiming to be able to solve the problem

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:19.996
of its own people.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.292
Twenty-first-century, transnational world

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.034
of problems and challenges,

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:29.010
17th-century world of political institutions.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.390
In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.236
And like many others, I've been thinking about

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:40.704
what can one do about this, this asymmetry

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:42.697
between 21st-century challenges

00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:46.752
and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:50.251
political institutions like nation-states.

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.955
And my suggestion is

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:55.576
that we change the subject,

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.688
that we stop talking about nations,

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.104
about bordered states,

00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:05.071
and we start talking about cities.

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.429
Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities,

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.486
we are talking about the political institutions

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.307
in which civilization and culture were born.

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:18.472
We are talking about the cradle of democracy.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:21.030
We are talking about the venues in which

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.243
those public spaces where we come together

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:28.310
to create democracy, and at the same time

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.273
protest those who would take our freedom, take place.

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:35.907
Think of some great names:

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:38.600
the Place de la Bastille,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.567
Zuccotti Park,

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.733
Tahrir Square,

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:47.039
Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.399
or, yes,

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.191
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:53.897
(Applause)

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:56.823
Those are the public spaces

00:02:56.823 --> 00:03:00.188
where we announce ourselves as citizens,

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:03.634
as participants, as people with the right

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07.909
to write our own narratives.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.587
Cities are not only the oldest of institutions,

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:12.555
they're the most enduring.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.727
If you think about it,

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:18.696
Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:21.806
Alexandria, much older than Egypt.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:25.756
Rome, far older than Italy.

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:29.364
Cities endure the ages.

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:34.147
They are the places where we are born,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:38.483
grow up, are educated, work, marry,

00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:43.342
pray, play, get old, and in time, die.

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:45.470
They are home.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.526
Very different than nation-states,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.867
which are abstractions.

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:52.989
We pay taxes, we vote occasionally,

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.364
we watch the men and women we choose rule

00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:59.588
rule more or less without us.

00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:03.896
Not so in those homes known as our towns

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.695
and cities where we live.

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:10.744
Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population

00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:12.751
live in cities.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.723
In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.718
More than three out of four people

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:22.758
live in urban institutions, urban places,

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:24.366
in cities today.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:27.142
So cities are where the action is.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.258
Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,

00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:33.839
man is a political animal.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.866
I say we are an urban animal.

00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:41.731
We are an urban species, at home in our cities.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:43.883
So to come back to the dilemma,

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.401
if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:50.185
political nation-states unable to govern the world,

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:53.199
respond to the global challenges that we face

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.359
like climate change,

00:04:55.359 --> 00:05:01.401
then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.610
for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.495
to engage in global governance.

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:12.326
When I say if mayors ruled the world,

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:14.594
when I first came up with that phrase,

00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:18.500
it occurred to me that actually, they already do.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.298
There are scores of international, inter-city,

00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:27.560
cross-border institutions, networks of cities

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.605
in which cities are already, quite quietly,

00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:33.432
below the horizon, working together

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:36.129
to deal with climate change, to deal with security,

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.517
to deal with immigration,

00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:39.176
to deal with all of those tough,

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:41.982
interdependent problems that we face.

00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:45.438
They have strange names:

00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:48.808
UCLG,

00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:53.434
United Cities and Local Governments;

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.234
ICLEI,

00:05:55.234 --> 00:06:00.750
the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.960
And the list goes on:

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.507
Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.992
out of Barcelona that is using the web

00:06:08.992 --> 00:06:12.069
to share best practices among countries.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.485
And then all the things we know a little better,

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:14.776
the U.S. Conference of Mayors,

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:16.812
the Mexican Conference of Mayors,

00:06:16.812 --> 00:06:20.378
the European Conference of Mayors.

00:06:20.378 --> 00:06:25.361
Mayors are where this is happening.

00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:27.890
And so the question is,

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.644
how can we create a world

00:06:29.644 --> 00:06:33.259
in which mayors and the citizens they represent

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.725
play a more prominent role?

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:38.675
Well, to understand that,

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:42.473
we need to understand why cities are special,

00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:44.368
why mayors are so different

00:06:44.368 --> 00:06:45.856
than prime ministers and presidents,

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:50.204
because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:54.483
are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.

00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:56.891
To be a prime minister or a president,

00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:59.050
you have to have an ideology,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.112
you have to have a meta-narrative,

00:07:01.112 --> 00:07:03.634
you have to have a theory of how things work,

00:07:03.634 --> 00:07:05.669
you have to belong to a party.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.226
Independents, on the whole,

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.976
don't get elected to office.

00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:11.209
But mayors are just the opposite.

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:15.658
Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.

00:07:15.658 --> 00:07:17.621
Their job is to get things done, and if they don't,

00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:20.340
they're out of a job.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.078
Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,

00:07:23.078 --> 00:07:26.660
we could never get away here in Philadelphia

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.970
with the stuff that goes on in Washington,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.985
the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:38.444
Why? Because potholes have to get filled,

00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:40.343
because the trains have to run,

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:43.292
because kids have to be able to get to school.

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:44.588
And that's what we have to do,

00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.527
and to do that is about pragmatism

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:49.499
in that deep, American sense,

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:51.429
reaching outcomes.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:57.538
Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,

00:07:57.538 --> 00:08:00.850
are anything but pragmatic,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.769
but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:05.493
They have to get things done,

00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:08.890
they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.254
and draw their cities together.

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:13.924
We saw this a couple of decades ago

00:08:13.924 --> 00:08:16.999
when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:19.104
in the '80s and the '90s,

00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:22.407
was besieged one day in his office

00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:27.070
by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.905
Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:31.404
They were arguing with one another

00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:33.530
about access to the holy sites.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.309
And the squabble went on and on,

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.151
and Kollek listened and listened,

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:41.453
and he finally said, "Gentlemen,

00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:43.609
spare me your sermons,

00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:46.653
and I will fix your sewers."

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:47.674
(Laughter)

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.738
That's what mayors do.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.158
They fix sewers, they get the trains running.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.706
There isn't a left or a right way of doing.

00:08:55.706 --> 00:09:00.183
Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.

00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:02.058
Strange term, but in some ways, he is.

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.491
He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.

00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:05.980
He rides to work on a bike,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.827
but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.

00:09:08.827 --> 00:09:12.067
Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat,

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:12.885
then he was a Republican,

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.722
and finally he was an Independent, and said

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.143
the party label just gets in the way.

00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:20.258
Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:23.718
though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,

00:09:23.718 --> 00:09:27.014
in fact refused to be defined by the party

00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:30.304
and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:33.177
not under Gorbachev, but under Putin,

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:37.330
who wanted a more faithful party follower.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.444
So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.

00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:42.817
They get things done.

00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:44.226
But the second thing about mayors

00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:48.407
is they are also what I like to call homeboys,

00:09:48.407 --> 00:09:51.047
or to include the women mayors, homies.

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:53.710
They're from the neighborhood.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.517
They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.

00:09:55.517 --> 00:09:57.792
Ed Koch used to wander around New York City

00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:00.308
saying, "How am I doing?"

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.963
Imagine David Cameron

00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:03.913
wandering around the United Kingdom

00:10:03.913 --> 00:10:06.391
asking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.

00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.109
Or Putin. Or any national leader.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.121
He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers

00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:12.997
and they knew him.

00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:16.863
Mayors are usually from the places they govern.

00:10:16.863 --> 00:10:19.667
It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:21.481
You can run for the Senate out of a different state,

00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.407
but it's hard to do that as a mayor.

00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:27.491
And as a result, mayors and city councillors

00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:29.228
and local authorities

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:31.479
have a much higher trust level,

00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:34.007
and this is the third feature about mayors,

00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:36.380
than national governing officials.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.965
In the United States, we know the pathetic figures:

00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:44.424
18 percent of Americans approve of Congress

00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:45.926
and what they do.

00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:49.525
And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,

00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:52.621
the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.406
sometimes 50 percent at best.

00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:57.575
The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.

00:10:57.575 --> 00:11:01.025
But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,

00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:03.201
do you trust your mayor?"

00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:08.354
the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:10.499
because they're from the neighborhood,

00:11:10.499 --> 00:11:13.416
because the people they work with are their neighbors,

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:16.833
because, like Mayor Booker in Newark,

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:20.032
a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work

00:11:20.032 --> 00:11:22.786
and go in and pull people out of a burning building --

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:25.124
that happened to Mayor Booker --

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:28.065
or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work

00:11:28.065 --> 00:11:29.397
because he sees it.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.780
No head of state would be permitted

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.632
by their security details to do it,

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:35.850
nor be in a position to do it.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.389
That's the difference, and the difference

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:39.554
has to do with the character of cities themselves,

00:11:39.554 --> 00:11:46.175
because cities are profoundly multicultural,

00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:50.510
open, participatory, democratic,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.164
able to work with one another.

00:11:53.164 --> 00:11:55.990
When states face each other,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.280
China and the U.S., they face each other like this.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.883
When cities interact, they interact like this.

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:08.190
China and the U.S., despite the recent

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.801
meta-meeting in California,

00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:15.566
are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:16.807
for number one.

00:12:16.807 --> 00:12:19.784
We heard more about who will be number one.

00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:21.935
Cities don't worry about number one.

00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:24.118
They have to work together, and they do work together.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:27.729
They work together in climate change, for example.

00:12:27.729 --> 00:12:31.235
Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:33.119
have been working together

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:35.309
many, many years before Copenhagen.

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:37.830
In Copenhagen, four or five years ago,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.224
184 nations came together to explain to one another

00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:43.469
why their sovereignty didn't permit them

00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:47.771
to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,

00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:51.047
but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited

00:12:51.047 --> 00:12:52.769
200 mayors to attend.

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:55.829
They came, they stayed, and they found ways

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:58.920
and are still finding ways to work together,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.369
city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.

00:13:02.369 --> 00:13:06.146
Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,

00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:08.030
which means cities are in a position

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.238
to solve the carbon problem, or most of it,

00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:14.026
whether or not the states of which they are a part

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:16.084
make agreements with one another.

00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:17.332
And they are doing it.

00:13:17.332 --> 00:13:19.632
Los Angeles cleaned up its port,

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.207
which was 40 percent of carbon emissions,

00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:25.988
and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.

00:13:25.988 --> 00:13:28.972
New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,

00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:32.156
make them better insulated in the winter,

00:13:32.156 --> 00:13:34.099
to not leak energy in the summer,

00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:37.046
not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.

00:13:37.046 --> 00:13:38.940
Bogota, where Mayor Mockus,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.176
when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:47.628
that saved energy, that allowed surface buses

00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:49.163
to run in effect like subways,

00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:51.079
express buses with corridors.

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:54.365
It helped unemployment, because people could get across town,

00:13:54.365 --> 00:13:58.221
and it had a profound impact on climate as well as

00:13:58.221 --> 00:13:59.292
many other things there.

00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:02.146
Singapore, as it developed its high-rises

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:03.851
and its remarkable public housing,

00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.344
also developed an island of parks,

00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:09.060
and if you go there, you'll see how much of it

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.601
is green land and park land.

00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:13.109
Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.

00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:14.694
They are doing it together.

00:14:14.694 --> 00:14:18.352
They are sharing what they do,

00:14:18.352 --> 00:14:22.321
and they are making a difference by shared best practices.

00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:23.953
Bike shares, many of you have heard of it,

00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:26.256
started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.

00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:28.600
Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.891
Pedestrian zones, congestion fees,

00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.601
emission limits in cities like California cities have,

00:14:35.601 --> 00:14:37.905
there's lots and lots that cities can do

00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:47.265
even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.

00:14:47.265 --> 00:14:51.233
So what's the bottom line here?

00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:54.980
The bottom line is, we still live politically

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.195
in a world of borders, a world of boundaries,

00:14:57.195 --> 00:14:58.793
a world of walls,

00:14:58.793 --> 00:15:04.953
a world where states refuse to act together.

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:08.746
Yet we know that the reality we experience

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:12.943
day to day is a world without borders,

00:15:12.943 --> 00:15:15.417
a world of diseases without borders

00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:17.717
and doctors without borders,

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:22.289
maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:28.360
of economics and technology without borders,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.476
of education without borders,

00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:33.706
of terrorism and war without borders.

00:15:33.706 --> 00:15:36.920
That is the real world, and unless we find a way

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.350
to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.718
we will increasingly not only risk

00:15:46.718 --> 00:15:50.799
the failure to address all of these transnational problems,

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:54.518
but we will risk losing democracy itself,

00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:59.144
locked up in the old nation-state box,

00:15:59.144 --> 00:16:04.837
unable to address global problems democratically.

00:16:04.837 --> 00:16:07.831
So where does that leave us?

00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:10.842
I'll tell you. The road to global democracy

00:16:10.842 --> 00:16:12.813
doesn't run through states.

00:16:12.813 --> 00:16:15.375
It runs through cities.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:20.175
Democracy was born in the ancient polis.

00:16:20.175 --> 00:16:25.683
I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.

00:16:25.683 --> 00:16:29.627
In that journey from polis to cosmopolis,

00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:31.898
we can rediscover the power

00:16:31.898 --> 00:16:34.021
of democracy on a global level.

00:16:34.021 --> 00:16:38.043
We can create not a League of Nations, which failed,

00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:39.431
but a League of Cities,

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.543
not a United or a dis-United Nations,

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:44.801
but United Cities of the World.

00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:48.888
We can create a global parliament of mayors.

00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:52.984
That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,

00:16:52.984 --> 00:16:55.666
but it's also on the table in City Halls

00:16:55.666 --> 00:16:58.394
in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,

00:16:58.394 --> 00:17:00.433
in Hamburg, and in New York.

00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:03.291
Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually

00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:06.450
constitute a global parliament of mayors,

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.330
and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.476
is a parliament of citizens

00:17:11.476 --> 00:17:15.371
and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,

00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.502
of you and of me.

00:17:18.502 --> 00:17:23.292
If ever there were citizens without borders,

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.435
I think it's the citizens of TED

00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:28.626
who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.

00:17:28.626 --> 00:17:33.556
I am ready to reach out and embrace

00:17:33.556 --> 00:17:35.882
a new global democracy,

00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:38.981
to take back our democracy.

00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:41.119
And the only question is,

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.178
are you?

00:17:43.178 --> 00:17:45.161
Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.

00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:56.351
(Applause)

00:17:56.351 --> 00:18:00.117
Thank you. (Applause)
