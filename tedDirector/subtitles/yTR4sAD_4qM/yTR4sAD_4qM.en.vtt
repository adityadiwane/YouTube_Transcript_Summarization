00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
He certainly doesn't look like me.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
He looks like this.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
His name is Matthieu Ricard.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Well it turns out

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And you do that by measuring the relative activation

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
versus the right prefrontal cortex.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And Matthieu's happiness measure

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
is off the charts.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
He's by far the happiest man

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
ever measured by science.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Which leads us to a question:

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
What was he thinking when he was being measured?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Perhaps something very naughty.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
(Laughter)

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Actually, he was meditating

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
on compassion.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Matthieu's own experience

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.260
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Reading about Matthieu

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
was one of the pivotal moments of my life.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
My dream

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
is to create the conditions

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
for world peace in my lifetime --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and to do that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
by creating the conditions

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
for inner peace

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and compassion

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
on a global scale.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And learning about Matthieu

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
gave me a new angle to look at my work.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Matthieu's brain scan shows

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
that compassion is not a chore.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Compassion is something that creates happiness.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Compassion is fun.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And that mind-blowing insight

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
changes the entire game.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Because if compassion was a chore,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
nobody's going to do it,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
But if compassion was fun,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
everybody's going to do it.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Therefore,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
to create the conditions for global compassion,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
all we have to do

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
is to reframe compassion

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
as something that is fun.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
But fun is not enough.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
What if compassion

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is also profitable?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
What if compassion is also good for business?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Then, every boss, every manager in the world,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
will want to have compassion --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
like this.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
That would create the conditions

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
for world peace.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So, I started paying attention

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
to what compassion looks like in a business setting.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
in Google, my company.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
but Google is the place I'm familiar with

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
because I've been there for 10 years,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
so I'll use Google as the case study.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Google is a company

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
born of idealism.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
It's a company that thrives on idealism.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And maybe because of that,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
compassion is organic

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and widespread company-wide.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
almost always follow the same pattern.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It's sort of a funny pattern.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It starts with a small group of Googlers

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
taking the initiative to do something.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And they don't usually ask for permission;

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
they just go ahead and do it,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And sometimes it gets big enough

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
to become official.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So in other words,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
it almost always starts from the bottom up.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And let me give you some examples.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
The first example is the largest annual community event --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
where Googlers from around the world

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
donate their labor to their local communities --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
was initiated and organized

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
by three employees

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
before it became official,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
because it just became too big.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Another example, three Googlers --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
a chef, an engineer

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and, most funny, a massage therapist --

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
three of them, they learned about a region in India

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
where 200,000 people live

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
without a single medical facility.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So what do they do?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And they raise enough money to build this hospital --

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
the first hospital of its kind

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
for 200,000 people.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
During the Haiti earthquake,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
a number of engineers and product managers

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
spontaneously came together

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and stayed overnight

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to build a tool

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And expressions of compassion

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
are also found in our international offices.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
In China for example,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
one mid-level employee

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
initiated the largest social action competition in China,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
involving more than 1,000 schools in China,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
working on issues

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
such as education, poverty,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
health care and the environment.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
There is so much organic social action

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
all around Google

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
that the company decided to form

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
a social responsibility team

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
just to support these efforts.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And this idea, again,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
came from the grassroots,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and volunteered themselves for the job.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And I found it fascinating

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that the social responsibility team

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and the company said, "Yes."

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So it turns out

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that Google is a compassionate company,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
because Googlers found

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
compassion to be fun.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But again, fun is not enough.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
There are also real business benefits.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So what are they?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
The first benefit of compassion

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
is that it creates highly effective business leaders.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
What does that mean?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
There are three components of compassion.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
There is the affective component,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
which is, "I feel for you."

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
There is the cognitive component,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
which is, "I understand you."

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And there is a motivational component,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
which is, "I want to help you."

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So what has this got to do with business leadership?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
According to a very comprehensive study

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
led by Jim Collins,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and documented in the book "Good to Great,"

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
it takes a very special kind of leader

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
to bring a company

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
from goodness to greatness.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
These are leaders

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
who, in addition to being highly capable,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
possess two important qualities,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and they are

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
humility and ambition.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
These are leaders

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
who are highly ambitious for the greater good.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And because they're ambitious for a greater good,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
they feel no need to inflate their own egos.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And they, according to the research,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
make the best business leaders.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And if you look at these qualities

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
in the context of compassion,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
we find

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.260
understanding people and empathizing with people --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
inhibits, tones down,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.260
what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
therefore creating the conditions

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
for humility.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The motivational component of compassion

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
creates ambition for greater good.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
In other words,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.260
compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And this is the first compelling business benefit.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
The second compelling benefit of compassion

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
is that it creates an inspiring workforce.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Employees mutually inspire each other

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
towards greater good.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It creates a vibrant, energetic community

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
where people admire and respect each other.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
I mean, you come to work in the morning,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and you work with three guys

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
your own coworkers?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So this mutual inspiration

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
promotes collaboration,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
initiative and creativity.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.260
It makes us a highly effective company.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So, having said all that,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
what is the secret formula

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
for brewing compassion

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
in the corporate setting?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
In our experience,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
there are three ingredients.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
The first ingredient

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is to create a culture

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
of passionate concern

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
for the greater good.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
So always think:

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
how is your company and your job

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
serving the greater good?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Or, how can you further serve

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
the greater good?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
This awareness of serving the greater good

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
is very self-inspiring

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and it creates fertile ground

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
for compassion to grow in.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
That's one.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
The second ingredient

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
is autonomy.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And one of our most popular managers jokes that,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
this is what he says,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
"Google is a place

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
where the inmates run the asylum."

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And he considers himself one of the inmates.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
If you already have

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
a culture of compassion

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and idealism

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and you let your people roam free,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
they will do the right thing

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
in the most compassionate way.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
The third ingredient

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
is to focus on inner development

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and personal growth.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Leadership training in Google, for example,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
such as self-awareness, self-mastery,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
empathy and compassion,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
because we believe

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that leadership begins

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
with character.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
We even created a seven-week curriculum

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
on emotion intelligence,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.260
which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
It's less naughty than it sounds.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
So I'm an engineer by training,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
which I find kind of funny,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
because this is a company that trusts an engineer

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
to teach emotion intelligence.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
What a company.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
(Laughter)

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
It works in three steps.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
The first step

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is attention training.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Attention is the basis

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.260
of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Therefore, any curriculum

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
for training emotion intelligence

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
has to begin with attention training.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
The idea here is to train attention

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
to create a quality of mind

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that is calm and clear

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
at the same time.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And this creates the foundation

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
for emotion intelligence.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
The second step follows the first step.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
The second step is developing self-knowledge

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and self-mastery.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
So using the supercharged attention from step one,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
we create a high-resolution perception

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
into the cognitive and emotive processes.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
What does that mean?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
It means being able to observe our thought stream

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
and the process of emotion

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
with high clarity,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
objectivity

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and from a third-person perspective.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And once you can do that,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
you create the kind of self-knowledge

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
that enables self-mastery.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
The third step, following the second step,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
is to create new mental habits.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
What does that mean? Imagine this.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Imagine whenever you meet any other person,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
any time you meet a person,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
your habitual, instinctive first thought

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
is, "I want you to be happy.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
I want you to be happy."

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Imagine you can do that.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Having this habit, this mental habit,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
changes everything at work.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Because this good will

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
is unconsciously picked up by other people,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and it creates trust,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And this also creates the conditions

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
for compassion in the workplace.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Someday, we hope to open-source

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
"Search Inside Yourself"

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
so that everybody in the corporate world

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
will at least be able to use it as a reference.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And in closing,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
I want to end the same place I started,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
with happiness.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.260
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
the Dalai Lama,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
who said, "If you want others to be happy,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
practice compassion.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
If you want to be happy,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
practice compassion."

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I found this to be true,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
both on the individual level

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and at a corporate level.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And I hope that compassion

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
will be both fun and profitable for you too.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Thank you.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:02.260
(Applause)
