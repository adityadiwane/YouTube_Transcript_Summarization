00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
My work is play.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
And I play when I design.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
that I actually do that,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and the definition of play,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
number one, was engaging in a childlike

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
activity or endeavor,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and number two was gambling.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
And I realize I do both

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
when I'm designing.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And I think that if you're not,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
there's probably something inherently wrong

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
with the structure or the situation you're in,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
if you're a designer.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
But the serious part is what threw me,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
and I couldn't quite get a handle

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
on it until I remembered an essay.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
It was written by Russell Baker,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
this essay,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
or an excerpt from it

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
because it really hit home for me.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Here is a letter of friendly advice.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Be serious, it says.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Being solemn is easy.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Being serious is hard.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Children almost always begin by being serious,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
which is what makes them so entertaining

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
when compared with adults as a class.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
like Adlai Stevenson,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
That's because it is hard for most people

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
to recognize seriousness, which is rare,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
which is commonplace.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
Jogging, which is commonplace,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Poker is serious.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Washington, D.C. is solemn.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
New York is serious.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
about the future is solemn.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
Taking a long walk by yourself,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
is serious.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160
(Laughter)

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
of solemnity or seriousness to design,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Solemn design is often important and very effective design.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Solemn design is also socially correct,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
and is accepted by appropriate audiences.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
It's what right-thinking designers

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
and all the clients are striving for.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Serious design, serious play,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
is something else.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
For one thing, it often happens

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
spontaneously, intuitively,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
accidentally or incidentally.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
parts of human behavior that

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
don't really make any sense.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Serious design is imperfect.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
the first of its kind.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
from the solemn point of view.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
That's because the art of serious play

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Perfection happens during solemn play.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
Now, I always saw design careers

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
like surreal staircases.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
If you look at the staircase, you'll see

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
that in your 20s the risers are very high

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
and the steps are very short,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
and you make huge discoveries.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
and so that anything you do is a learning experience

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
and you're just jumping right up there.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
As you get older, the risers get shallower

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
and the steps get wider,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
and you start moving along at a slower pace

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
because you're making fewer discoveries.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
And as you get older and more decrepit,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
you sort of inch along on this

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
sort of depressing, long staircase,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
leading you into oblivion.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
(Laughter)

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And in my 35 years of working experience,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
I think I was really serious four times.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
And I'm going to show them to you now,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
because they came out of very specific conditions.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
It's great to be a kid.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Now, when I was in my early 20s,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
and I had no idea what a great job I had.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I thought everybody had a job like that.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And what --

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
what was going on around me

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
and the things that came at the time I walked into design

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
were the enemy.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
I really, really, really hated

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
the typeface Helvetica.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
I thought the typeface Helvetica

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
really repressive typeface,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
And when I was in

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
my college days,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
this was the sort of design

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
that was fashionable and popular.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
and I made parodies about it.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
(Laughter)

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
So -- so, my goal in life

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
in the early 70s. There weren't --

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
You had to go places and find the stuff.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And what I responded to was, you know,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
Art Nouveau, or deco,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
or Victorian typography,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
or things that were just completely not Helvetica.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
And I taught myself design this way,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
and this was sort of my early years,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
and I used these things

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
in really goofy ways

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
on record covers and in my design.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
I wasn't educated. I just sort of

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
put these things together.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And I made these very lush,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
very elaborate record covers,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
because I didn't know what those things were.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
I just hated Helvetica.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160
(Laughter)

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
And that kind of passion

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
drove me into very serious play,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
a kind of play I could never do now

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
because I'm too well-educated.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And there's something wonderful about

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
that form of youth,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
where you can let yourself

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
grow and play, and be

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
really a brat, and then accomplish things.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
By the end of the '70s, actually,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
the stuff became known.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
and they started winning awards,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and people knew them.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
And I was suddenly a post-modernist,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
and I began a career as -- in my own business.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
I didn't do what I think

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
turning out these sorts of designs

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
that I was expected to do

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
because that's who I was,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
So, here was the second condition

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.160
for which I think I accomplished some serious play.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
There's a Paul Newman movie

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
that I love called "The Verdict."

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
And in the movie, he plays

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
a down-and-out lawyer

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
who's become an ambulance chaser.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
And he's taken on --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
that's sort of an easy deal,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
and in the midst of trying to connect the deal,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
he starts to empathize

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
and identify with his client,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
and he regains his morality and purpose,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
and he goes on to win the case.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
And in the depth of despair,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160
in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
and he needs this case,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
he needs to win this case so badly.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
There's a shot of Paul Newman alone,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
in his office, saying,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
"This is the case. There are no other cases.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
This is the case. There are no other cases."

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And in that moment of

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
desire and focus,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
he can win.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
And that is a wonderful

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
position to be in to create some serious play.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
And I had that moment in 1994

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
when I met a theater director

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
named George Wolfe,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
who was going to have me design

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
then known,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
and then became the Public Theater.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
And I began getting immersed

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
in this project

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
in a way I never was before.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
They had no logo and no identity,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
but they had these very iconic posters

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
painted by Paul Davis.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
And George Wolf had taken over from another director

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and he wanted to change the theater,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
and he wanted to make it urban and loud

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
and a place that was inclusive.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
So, drawing on my love of typography,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
I immersed myself into this project.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
And what was different about it was the totality of it,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
in a way I had never done before,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
where every aspect --

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was --

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
was designed by me.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
There was no format.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
I literally for three years made everything --

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
every scrap of paper, everything online,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
that this theater did.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And it was the only job,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
even though I was doing other jobs.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
with a client since.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
And I think that you know

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
when you're going to be given this position,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.160
and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
it's the moment of serious play.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
I did these things, and I still do them.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
I still work for the Public Theater.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
I'm on their board, and

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
I still am involved with it.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
two years after I designed it,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
that was all over New York.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
But something happened to it, and what happened to it was,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
it became very popular.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
And that is a kiss of death for something serious

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
because it makes it solemn.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
And what happened was

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
that New York City, to a degree,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
ate my identity

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
because people began to copy it.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
Here's an ad in the New York Times

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
which meant I had to change it.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
So, I changed it so that every season was different,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
and I continued to do these posters,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
but they never had the seriousness

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
of the first identity

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
of everything being the same thing.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
I must have done more than a dozen

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
cultural identities for major institutions,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
and I don't think I ever -- I ever

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
grasped that seriousness again --

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
I do them for very big, important institutions

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
in New York City.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
The institutions are solemn,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
and so is the design.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and they spend more money on them, but I think

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
that that moment comes and goes.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
The best way to accomplish serious design --

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
which I think we all have the opportunity to do --

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.160
is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
That doesn't happen very often,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
but it happened to me in the year 2000,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
when for some reason or another,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
a whole pile of different architects

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
started to ask me to design

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
the insides of theaters with them,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
I'd never done this kind of work before.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
I didn't know what they were talking about,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
a single job -- could go on for four years

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
because I was used to immediacy in graphic design,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and that kind of attention to detail

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
but I fell in love with this process

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
of actually integrating graphics into architecture

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
New Yorkers look at their feet.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And then I found that actors and actresses

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
actually take their cues from the floor,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
began to make sense.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
They ran around corners,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
they went up sides of buildings,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
and they melded into the architecture.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and backlit with fiber optics.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
And the architect, Jim Polshek,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
essentially gave me a canvas

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
to play typography out on.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
And it was serious play.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
made out of completely inexpensive materials.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Things I never did before, built before.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
And then, inexpensive signage.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.160
(Laughter)

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
I think my favorite of these

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
It's a performing arts school.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
This is the building that -- they had no money,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160
and they had to recast it, and they said,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
Well, I think we can paint it.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And we did. And it was play.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And there's the building. Everything was painted --

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
typography over the whole damn thing,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
including the air conditioning ducts.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
I hired guys who paint flats

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
fixed on the sides of garages

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
They used to climb up on the building and call me

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
and tell me that they had to correct my typography --

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
and they did wonderful things with it.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
my work had begun to become accepted.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
People wanted it in big, expensive places.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
And that began to make it solemn.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
Bloomberg was all about numbers,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
and we did big numbers through the space

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
But it became the end

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
of the seriousness of the play,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
and it started to, once again, become solemn.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
This is a current project

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
where I got to be goofy.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
I was invited to design

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
So I had to actually give a presentation

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
to a city council

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
and neighborhood constituents,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
"You know, really what you have here

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
are all these underpasses

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
So I began doing this crazy presentation

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
of these installations --

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
potential installations -- on

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
these underpass bridges,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
and stood up in front of the city council --

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
and was a little bit scared,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
I have to admit.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
and so utterly ridiculous,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.160
and ignored the brief so desperately

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.160
just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
And this is the bridge they're actually

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
painting up and preparing as we speak.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
in the North Side of Pittsburgh,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
and it will probably become a landmark in the area.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
John Hockenberry told you a bit about

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
my travail with Citibank,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.160
that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
And I actually am amused by them and like them,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
they actually keep their graphics very nice.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
I drew the logo for Citibank

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
on a napkin in the first meeting.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
That was the play part of the job.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
And then I spent a year

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
going to long, tedious,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
boring meetings,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
trying to sell this logo through

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
to a huge corporation

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
to the point of tears.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
We made idiotic presentations

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
showing how the Citi logo made sense,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
and how it was really derived from an umbrella,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
and we made animations of these things,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.160
and it played out on such a grand scale,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.160
and it's so internationally recognizable,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.160
but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
until Fallon put it on

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
its very good "Live Richly" campaign,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.160
and then everybody accepted it all over the world.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
So during this time I needed

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
some kind of counterbalance

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
for this crazy, crazy existence

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
of going to these long, idiotic meetings.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
And I was up in my country house,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
and for some reason, I began painting

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
these very big, very involved,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
laborious, complicated

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
maps of the entire world,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.160
and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
and completely controlling the information,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160
and going totally and completely nuts with it.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160
They would take me about six months initially,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
but then I started getting faster at it.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
Here's the United States.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
Every single city of the United States is on here.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
And it hung for about eight months

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.160
at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
and they would point to a part of the map

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.160
(Laughter)

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160
But what I liked about it was,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
I was controlling my own idiotic information,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.160
and I was creating my own palette of information,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
and I was totally and completely

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
at play.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160
One of my favorites was

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.160
that has the election results rolling around in the water.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.160
I keep that for evidence.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
(Laughter)

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
Somebody

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.160
was up at my house and saw the paintings

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
and recommended them to a gallery,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
and I had a first show

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160
about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.160
that I'm showing you now.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
And they sold quickly,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.160
and became rather popular.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.160
We started making prints from them.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.160
This is Manhattan, one from the series.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.160
This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
We began doing these big silkscreen prints,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
and they started selling, too.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
So, the gallery wanted me to have another show

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
in two years,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
which meant that I really

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160
had to paint these paintings

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160
much faster

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160
than I had ever done them. And I --

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
they started to become more political, and I picked areas

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
that sort of were in the news

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.160
or that I had some feeling about,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
and I began doing these things.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
And then this funny thing happened.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.160
I found that I was no longer at play.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.160
I was actually in this solemn landscape

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.160
of fulfilling an expectation

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
for a show,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.160
which is not where I started with these things.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.160
So, while they became successful,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
I know how to make them,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
so I'm not a neophyte,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.160
and they're no longer serious --

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.160
they have become solemn.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160
And that's a terrifying factor --

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.160
when you start something and it turns that way --

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.160
because it means that all that's left for you

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160
is to go back and to find out

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.160
what the next thing is that you can push,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.160
that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
that you can be arrogant about,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
that you can fail with,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160
and that you can be a fool with.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.160
Because in the end, that's how you grow,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.160
and that's all that matters.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.160
So, I'm plugging along here --

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.160
(Laughter)

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160
and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.160
Thank you very much.
