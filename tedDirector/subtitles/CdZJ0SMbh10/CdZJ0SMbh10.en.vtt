00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.009
I am an engineering professor,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.125
and for the past 14 years

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:18.933
I've been teaching crap.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.238
(Laughter)

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:22.255
Not that I'm a bad teacher,

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.373
but I've been studying and teaching

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.260
about human waste

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.891
and how waste is conveyed

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.774
through these wastewater treatment plants,

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:32.349
and how we engineer and design

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.339
these treatment plants so that we can protect

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.421
surface water like rivers.

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.071
I've based my scientific career

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.508
on using leading-edge molecular techniques,

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.120
DNA- and RNA-based methods

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.559
to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.922
and again to optimize these systems.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.171
And over the years,

00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.423
I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.415
and I've been known to sneak into toilets

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:01.218
and take my camera phone

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.566
all over the world.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.790
But along the way, I've learned

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.332
that it's not just the technical side,

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:12.510
but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.979
So for example,

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.286
how many of you are washers

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.738
and how many of you are wipers?

00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:22.945
(Laughter)

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:26.882
If, well, I guess you know what I mean.

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:29.121
If you're a washer, then you use water

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.933
for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.791
And if you're a wiper,

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.883
then you use toilet paper

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.638
or, in some regions of the world

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:42.272
where it's not available, newspaper

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:45.792
or rags or corncobs.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:48.290
And this is not just a piece of trivia,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.146
but it's really important to understand

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.339
and solve the sanitation problem.

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.623
And it is a big problem:

00:01:54.623 --> 00:01:56.668
There are 2.5 billion people in the world

00:01:56.668 --> 00:01:59.829
who don't have access to adequate sanitation.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.932
For them, there's no modern toilet.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:05.843
And there are 1.1 billion people

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.237
whose toilets are the streets

00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:11.163
or river banks or open spaces,

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.142
and again, the technical term for that is

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:15.179
open defecation,

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.283
but that is really simply

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:20.342
shitting in the open.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:22.245
And if you're living in fecal material

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:24.580
and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.086
It's going to get into your drinking water,

00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:28.502
into your food, into your immediate surroundings.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.947
So the United Nations estimates

00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:35.059
that every year, there are 
1.5 million child deaths

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.768
because of inadequate sanitation.

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:41.817
That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:44.427
171 every hour,

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:47.645
4,100 every day.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:49.737
And so, to avoid open defecation,

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:51.912
municipalities and cities

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:56.104
build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,

00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:58.026
in peri-urban and rural areas.

00:02:58.026 --> 00:03:01.333
For example, in KwaZulu-Natal 
province in South Africa,

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.667
they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.860
But there's a problem when you scale up

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.110
to tens of thousands, and the problem is,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.912
what happens when the pits are full?

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:13.497
This is what happens.

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:15.871
People defecate around the toilet.

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.976
In schools, children defecate on the floors

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:21.147
and then leave a trail outside the building

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:23.930
and start defecating around the building,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.164
and these pits have to be cleaned

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.695
and manually emptied.

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.043
And who does the emptying?

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.565
You've got these workers

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:35.299
who have to sometimes go down into the pits

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.700
and manually remove the contents.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.547
It's a dirty and dangerous business.

00:03:41.547 --> 00:03:43.865
As you can see, there's no protective equipment,

00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:45.454
no protective clothing.

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:46.460
There's one worker down there.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.098
I hope you can see him.

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.954
He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:53.385
And in some countries, like India,

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:55.859
the lower castes are condemned

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.233
to empty the pits,

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:00.809
and they're further condemned by society.

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.756
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:06.591
and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:09.112
for these two and a half billion?

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.417
And the answer is, it's just not possible.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.275
In some of these areas, there's not enough water,

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.648
there's no energy,

00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:17.683
it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars

00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:19.258
to lay out the sewer lines

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.129
and to build the facilities

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.523
and to operate and maintain these systems,

00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.095
and if you don't build it right,

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:25.996
you're going to have flush toilets

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:28.404
that basically go straight into the river,

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.879
just like what's happening in many cities

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.272
in the developing world.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.321
And is this really the solution?

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:36.211
Because essentially, what you're doing is

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.596
you're using clean water

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:40.661
and you're using it to flush your toilet,

00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.147
convey it to a wastewater treatment plant

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:44.891
which then discharges to a river,

00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.647
and that river, again, is a drinking water source.

00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:49.942
So we've got to rethink sanitation,

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:54.507
and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,

00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:56.408
and I'm going to argue that to do this,

00:04:56.408 --> 00:04:58.725
you have to employ systems thinking.

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.695
We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:03.968
We start with a human interface,

00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:05.869
and then we have to think about how feces

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:08.253
are collected and stored,

00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:10.975
transported, treated and reused â€”

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:13.140
and not just disposal but reuse.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.633
So let's start with the human user interface.

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:19.457
I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.460
a sitter or a squatter,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.552
the human user interface should be clean

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:26.353
and easy to use, because after all,

00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:28.727
taking a dump should be pleasurable.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:31.348
(Laughter)

00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:34.205
And when we open the possibilities

00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:36.916
to understanding this sanitation chain,

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.986
then the back-end technology,

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:42.676
the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.969
and then we can apply

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.806
locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.506
So we can open ourselves to possibilities like,

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:53.401
for example, this urine-diverting toilet,

00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.233
and there's two holes in this toilet.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:56.415
There's the front and the back,

00:05:56.415 --> 00:05:58.489
and the front collects the urine,

00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:00.393
and the back collects the fecal material.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.239
And so what you're doing is
you're separating the urine,

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:04.308
which has 80 percent of the nitrogen

00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:06.558
and 50 percent of the phosphorus,

00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:08.639
and then that can then be treated

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.260
and precipitated to form things like struvite,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.229
which is a high-value fertilizer,

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.727
and then the fecal material can then be disinfected

00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:19.416
and again converted to high-value end products.

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.621
Or, for example, in some of our research,

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.264
you can reuse the water by treating it

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:26.402
in on-site sanitation systems

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:29.163
like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.

00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:31.846
So we can open up all these possibilities

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:35.334
if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:37.000
and treatment plants.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.418
So you might be asking, who's going to pay?

00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:42.376
Well, I'm going to argue that governments

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:45.807
should fund sanitation infrastructure.

00:06:45.807 --> 00:06:48.338
NGOs and donor organizations,

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:51.758
they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.

00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:53.423
Governments should fund sanitation

00:06:53.423 --> 00:06:55.178
the same way they fund roads

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:58.638
and schools and hospitals

00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:00.790
and other infrastructure like bridges,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.893
because we know, and the WHO has done this study,

00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:05.727
that for every dollar that we invest

00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:07.616
in sanitation infrastructure,

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:11.126
we get something like three to 34 dollars back.

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:13.578
Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.

00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:15.073
So at North Carolina State University,

00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:18.260
we challenged our students to
come up with a simple solution,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.744
and this is what they came up with:

00:07:19.744 --> 00:07:22.387
a simple, modified screw auger

00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:24.321
that can move the waste up

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.840
from the pit and into a collecting drum,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.336
and now the pit worker

00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:30.441
doesn't have to go down into the pit.

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.347
We tested it in South Africa, and it works.

00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:34.075
We need to make it more robust,

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:35.368
and we're going to do more testing

00:07:35.368 --> 00:07:37.934
in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:39.553
And our idea is to make this

00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:42.060
a professionalized pit-emptying service

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.638
so that we can create a small business out of it,

00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:46.471
create profits and jobs,

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:47.855
and the hope is that,

00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:49.646
as we are rethinking sanitation,

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:53.024
we are extending the life of these pits

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:55.172
so that we don't have to resort

00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:56.977
to quick solutions

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.941
that don't really make sense.

00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:02.569
I believe that access to adequate sanitation

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:04.493
is a basic human right.

00:08:04.493 --> 00:08:06.110
We need to stop the practice

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.900
of lower castes and lower-status people

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.442
going down and being condemned to empty pits.

00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:14.422
It is our moral, it is our social

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.571
and our environmental obligation.

00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:18.640
Thank you.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.315
(Applause)
