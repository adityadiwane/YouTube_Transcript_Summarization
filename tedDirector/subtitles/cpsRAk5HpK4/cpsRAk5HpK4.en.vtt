00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:18.654
So I'd like to start by focusing on

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:21.190
the world's most dangerous animal.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.350
Now, when you talk about dangerous animals,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.397
most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:28.074
But of course the most dangerous animal

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:29.937
is the mosquito.

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.096
The mosquito has killed more humans

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:35.085
than any other creature in human history.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.075
In fact, probably adding them all together,

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.261
the mosquito has killed more humans.

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.920
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.619
and plague.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.192
And you would think, would you not,

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:50.139
that with all our science, with all our advances in society,

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.035
with better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.251
wealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:00.944
and hence reduce this disease.

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:04.286
And that's not really the case.

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:06.406
If it was the case, we wouldn't have

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.993
between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,

00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:12.718
and we wouldn't have

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:16.660
a million and a half deaths from malaria,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.360
and we wouldn't have a disease

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.896
that was relatively unknown 50 years ago

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:24.728
now suddenly turned into

00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:27.960
the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.653
and that's called dengue fever.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:33.384
So 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.376
no one certainly in the European environment.

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:40.009
But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.496
infects between 50 and 100 million people every year,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:45.832
so that's equivalent to the whole of the population

00:01:45.832 --> 00:01:48.760
of the U.K. being infected every year.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.872
Other estimates put that number at roughly double

00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:55.830
that number of infections.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.265
And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.315
In the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.533
has grown thirtyfold.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:08.036
Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:09.624
for those who don't know.

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:11.833
Now let's assume you go on holiday.

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:13.595
Let's assume you go to the Caribbean,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:15.988
or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:19.947
Asia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:21.670
You might go to India, the Far East.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.283
It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:27.195
and it's the same disease. You're at risk.

00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:29.871
And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.432
that's carrying that virus.

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:34.427
Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms.

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:36.205
They could be quite mild.

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:38.306
You could develop nausea, headache,

00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:40.745
your muscles could feel like they're contracting,

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:44.831
and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.055
And that's the nickname given to this disease.

00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:48.648
It's called breakbone fever,

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:50.992
because that's how you can feel.

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:53.929
Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.191
by this mosquito, and you've had this disease,

00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:58.813
your body develops antibodies,

00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:03.227
so if you're bitten again with that strain,

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.943
it doesn't affect you.

00:03:04.943 --> 00:03:07.863
But it's not one virus, it's four,

00:03:07.863 --> 00:03:10.839
and the same protection that gives you the antibodies

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.151
and protects you from the same virus that you had before

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:17.217
actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:19.952
So the next time you get dengue fever,

00:03:19.952 --> 00:03:22.592
if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:25.223
you're likely to get worse symptoms,

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.824
and you're more likely to get the more severe forms,

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.086
hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.505
So you don't want dengue once,

00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:35.246
and you certainly don't want it again.

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:38.529
So why is it spreading so fast?

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:40.625
And the answer is this thing.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:42.399
This is Aedes aegypti.

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.609
Now this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.051
out of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.

00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:52.179
Now, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.908
about 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.

00:03:55.908 --> 00:03:58.293
What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,

00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.703
particularly the eggs.

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:04.400
They will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.350
any birdbath, any flower pot,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.090
anywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.712
and if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,

00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:15.361
if it's anywhere near transport,

00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.545
those eggs will then get transported around the world.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:20.968
And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported

00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:22.974
these eggs all the way around the world,

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:26.672
and these insects have infested over 100 countries,

00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:29.370
and there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.362
where this mosquito resides.

00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:33.946
To give you just a couple of examples

00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:36.462
how fast this has happened,

00:04:36.462 --> 00:04:41.978
in the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti,"

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:44.328
and currently they spend about a billion dollars now

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:47.128
a year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:52.229
just one species of mosquito.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.772
Two days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:57.736
I saw a Reuters report that said

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.370
Madeira had had their first cases of dengue,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.190
about 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.004
That's two days ago.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:11.185
Interestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.242
and here we are, a few years later,

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:14.569
first cases of dengue.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.928
So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:20.242
dengue will follow.

00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:22.433
Once you've got the mosquito in your area,

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:24.802
anyone coming into that area with dengue,

00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:27.745
mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:28.709
somewhere else, somewhere else,

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.824
and you'll get an epidemic.

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:34.732
So we must be good at killing mosquitos.

00:05:34.732 --> 00:05:36.629
I mean, that can't be very difficult.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.449
Well, there's two principle ways.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.821
The first way is that you use larvicides.

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:45.633
You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:48.433
Now in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:50.618
You've got to get your chemical into every puddle,

00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.866
every birdbath, every tree trunk.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:55.908
It's just not practical.

00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:57.424
The second way you can do it

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:00.738
is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.

00:06:00.738 --> 00:06:02.964
This is a picture of fogging.

00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:05.409
Here what someone is doing

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.323
is mixing up chemical in a smoke

00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:11.337
and basically spreading that through the environment.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:14.297
You could do the same with a space spray.

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:15.865
This is really unpleasant stuff,

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.267
and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase

00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:22.923
in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:25.012
So it's not very effective, but it's probably

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:27.907
the best thing we've got at the moment.

00:06:27.907 --> 00:06:30.059
Having said that, actually, your best form of protection

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.444
and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:35.868
and a little bit of DEET to go with it.

00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:39.557
So let's start again. Let's design a product,

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:42.833
right from the word go, and decide what we want.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.428
Well we clearly need something that is effective

00:06:45.428 --> 00:06:47.736
at reducing the mosquito population.

00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:50.168
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:53.260
We want something that gets that population right the way down

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.276
so it can't get the disease transmission.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:59.580
Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.756
We are going to use it in and around humans.

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:03.319
It has to be safe.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.549
We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:08.783
We don't want to do anything that you can't undo.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:13.876
Maybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.

00:07:13.876 --> 00:07:16.750
Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.022
We want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.975
because there's an awful lot of countries involved,

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:23.981
and some of them are emerging markets,

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:27.543
some of them emerging countries, low-income.

00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:29.918
And finally, you want something that's species-specific.

00:07:29.918 --> 00:07:32.706
You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:35.694
but you don't really want to get all the other insects.

00:07:35.694 --> 00:07:38.910
Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.748
This one's not. It's invaded you.

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:43.430
But you don't want to get all of the insects.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.089
You just want to get this one.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.948
And most of the time, you'll find this insect

00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:49.383
lives in and around your home,

00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:53.307
so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect.

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.690
It's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.484
into the kitchens.

00:07:57.484 --> 00:08:01.129
Now there are two features of mosquito biology

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:03.029
that really help us in this project,

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:06.901
and that is, firstly, males don't bite.

00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:10.010
It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.411
The male can't bite you, won't bite you,

00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.714
doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.

00:08:14.714 --> 00:08:16.373
It's just the female.

00:08:16.373 --> 00:08:18.346
And the second is a phenomenon

00:08:18.346 --> 00:08:22.562
that males are very, very good at finding females.

00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:25.210
If there's a male mosquito that you release,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:30.053
and if there's a female around, that male will find the female.

00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:33.871
So basically, we've used those two factors.

00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:35.539
So here's a typical situation,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.107
male meets female, lots of offspring.

00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:39.836
A single female will lay about

00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:41.631
up to 100 eggs at a time,

00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.115
up to about 500 in her lifetime.

00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:47.136
Now if that male is carrying a gene

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.754
which causes the death of the offspring,

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:52.435
then the offspring don't survive,

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:55.866
and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:58.487
you have none.

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:01.606
And if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:04.479
that the offspring will actually die at different stages,

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:06.068
but I'll call them sterile for now.

00:09:06.068 --> 00:09:09.624
If you put more sterile males out into the environment,

00:09:09.624 --> 00:09:12.912
then the females are more likely to find a sterile male

00:09:12.912 --> 00:09:18.751
than a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.

00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.146
So the males will go out, they'll look for females,

00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:24.970
they'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.973
If they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.

00:09:27.973 --> 00:09:31.707
They only live a few days.

00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.941
And that's exactly where we are.

00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.571
So this is technology that was developed

00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:38.123
in Oxford University a few years ago.

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:40.544
The company itself, Oxitec, we've been working

00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:43.093
for the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:46.535
development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:50.645
So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:54.037
to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.

00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:56.524
And then we've gone out into the big outdoors,

00:09:56.524 --> 00:09:58.125
always with local community consent,

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.310
always with the necessary permits.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.373
So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:04.919
a small one in Malaysia,

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:09.254
and two more now in Brazil.

00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:10.987
And what's the result?

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:14.295
Well, the result has been very good.

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:17.119
In about four months of release,

00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:19.415
we've brought that population of mosquitos

00:10:19.415 --> 00:10:21.958
— in most cases we're dealing with villages here

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.230
of about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.668
starting small —

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.859
we've taken that mosquito population down

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:32.083
by about 85 percent in about four months.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.082
And in fact, the numbers after that get,

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:37.822
those get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.

00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.478
So that's been what we've seen in Cayman,

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:42.740
it's been what we've seen in Brazil

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.726
in those trials.

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:47.038
And now what we're doing is we're going through a process

00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:49.871
to scale up to a town of about 50,000,

00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:52.244
so we can see this work at big scale.

00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:55.031
And we've got a production unit in Oxford,

00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:58.522
or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.

00:10:58.522 --> 00:10:59.726
We can produce them,

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.882
in a space a bit more than this red carpet,

00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:04.406
I can produce about 20 million a week.

00:11:04.406 --> 00:11:06.572
We can transport them around the world.

00:11:06.572 --> 00:11:09.594
It's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup --

00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:10.883
something the size of a coffee cup

00:11:10.883 --> 00:11:14.210
will hold about three million eggs.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.028
So freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)

00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:21.332
So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.

00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:24.428
And for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,

00:11:24.428 --> 00:11:26.316
the Brazilian government themselves have now built

00:11:26.316 --> 00:11:28.748
their own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:34.223
and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:36.596
There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:39.228
We've separated the males from the females.

00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:42.878
The males have been put in little pots

00:11:42.878 --> 00:11:44.962
and the truck is going down the road

00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:47.926
and they are releasing males as they go.

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:49.576
It's actually a little bit more precise than that.

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.057
You want to release them so that

00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:53.138
you get good coverage of your area.

00:11:53.138 --> 00:11:55.929
So you take a Google Map, you divide it up,

00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:57.813
work out how far they can fly,

00:11:57.813 --> 00:11:59.788
and make sure you're releasing such that you get

00:11:59.788 --> 00:12:02.686
coverage of the area, and then you go back,

00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:04.460
and within a very short space of time,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.036
you're bringing that population right the way down.

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:10.468
We've also done this in agriculture.

00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:14.540
We've got several different species of agriculture coming along,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.448
and I'm hoping that soon

00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:19.244
we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:22.326
and start looking at malaria.

00:12:22.326 --> 00:12:24.375
So that's where we stand at the moment,

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.904
and I've just got a few final thoughts,

00:12:26.904 --> 00:12:30.348
which is that this is another way in which biology

00:12:30.348 --> 00:12:34.337
is now coming in to supplement chemistry

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:38.080
in some of our societal advances in this area,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.368
and these biological approaches are coming in

00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:42.769
in very different forms,

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:45.091
and when you think about genetic engineering,

00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:48.097
we've now got enzymes for industrial processing,

00:12:48.097 --> 00:12:51.031
enzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.

00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:53.833
We have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.149
we have new vaccines,

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:59.233
all using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.

00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:02.746
And I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.

00:13:02.746 --> 00:13:05.642
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies

00:13:05.642 --> 00:13:08.714
don't work well or have become unacceptable.

00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:12.071
And although the techniques are similar,

00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:13.612
the outcomes are very, very different,

00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:15.126
and if you take our approach, for example,

00:13:15.126 --> 00:13:17.551
and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,

00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:21.843
both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.986
Both have a side benefit,

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:27.695
which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.

00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:31.656
But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,

00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:34.400
for example, and give it an advantage,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.495
what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito

00:13:37.495 --> 00:13:41.584
and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,

00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:44.568
rendering it unable to reproduce effectively.

00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:48.168
So for the mosquito, it's a dead end.

00:13:48.168 --> 00:13:51.975
Thank you very much. (Applause)
