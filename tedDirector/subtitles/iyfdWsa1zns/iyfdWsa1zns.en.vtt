00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.013
Over the last two decades, India has become

00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:18.052
a global hub for software development

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:22.079
and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.099
and what we were interested in finding out was that

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.039
because of this huge industry that has started

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.050
over the last two decades in India,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.041
offshoring software development and back office services,

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.064
there's been a flight of white collar jobs

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:42.015
from the developed world to India.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.071
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs

00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:49.001
to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.089
amongst the Western populations.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.051
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining

00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.087
trend for support for free trade in the West.

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:03.086
Now, the Western elites, however, have said

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:05.086
this fear is misplaced.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:08.008
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.040
have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.074
called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.093
that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:21.067
because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:25.051
that everything that can be invented has been invented.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.037
In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West

00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:30.010
ahead of the developing world,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.052
with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done

00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:36.025
in the developed world, and the less sophisticated,

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:37.083
shall we say, drudge work being done

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.099
in the developing world.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.031
Now, what we were trying to understand was,

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:47.007
is this true?

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.086
Could India become a source, or a global hub,

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:54.003
of innovation, just like it's become a global hub

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.090
for back office services and software development?

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.072
And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:05.002
and I spent investigating this topic.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:09.002
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.043
in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.069
the Western innovative model, say,

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.027
"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:20.053
if the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:22.088
So initially, when we started our research, we went

00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:24.098
and met several executives, and we asked them,

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:27.027
"What do you think? Will India go from being a favored

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:30.027
destination for software services and back office services

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:33.037
to a destination for innovation?"

00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:35.023
They laughed. They dismissed us.

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:38.030
They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.060
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.067
make good software programmers and accountants,

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:46.017
but they can't do the creative stuff."

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:50.083
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:53.033
and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.094
It's really the rule-based, regimented education system

00:02:56.094 --> 00:03:01.032
in India that is responsible for killing all creativity."

00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:03.086
They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.085
go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:08.051
like Google, Microsoft, Intel.

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.005
So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labs

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.057
of Silicon Valley.

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:15.071
Well, interestingly, what you find there is,

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.064
usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.061
or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it,

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:24.024
and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:27.027
So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:28.062
educated in India, right?

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.018
You must have gotten your education here."

00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:34.004
It turned out, in every single case,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.026
they came out of the Indian educational system.

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:40.075
So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.062
and the right question is, really, can Indians

00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:47.042
based out of India do innovative work?

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:49.070
So off we went to India. We made, I think,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.092
about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,

00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:55.011
Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine

00:03:55.011 --> 00:04:00.036
what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.

00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:02.094
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,

00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:05.090
was, that we were asking really the wrong question.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.065
When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:11.099
iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.015
on innovation, which is innovation for end users,

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:17.078
visible innovation.

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:21.047
Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you

00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:23.048
may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,

00:04:23.048 --> 00:04:25.055
he said, "Innovation is novelty

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:29.031
in how value is created and distributed."

00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:31.044
It could be new products and services,

00:04:31.044 --> 00:04:33.077
but it could also be new ways of producing products.

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:36.091
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:40.077
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,

00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:44.077
the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.

00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:47.038
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,

00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:50.072
what we found was, India is well represented

00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:54.006
in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India

00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:57.026
is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:59.091
we called it "invisible innovation."

00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:02.078
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:04.098
that are coming out of India.

00:05:04.098 --> 00:05:07.068
The first type of invisible innovation out of India

00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:10.057
is what we call innovation for business customers,

00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.042
which is led by the multinational corporations,

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:16.035
which have -- in the last two decades, there have been

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:22.064
750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies

00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:26.086
employing more than 400,000 professionals.

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:31.012
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:34.029
the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.098
was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin

00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:42.088
of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers

00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:45.025
of multinational corporations in India

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:47.082
is truly a remarkable figure.

00:05:47.082 --> 00:05:50.005
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation

00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:52.066
centers and asked them what are they working on,

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:54.076
they said, "We are working on global products."

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:57.039
They were not working on localizing global products

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.011
for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D.

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:03.061
They were working on truly global products,

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:07.037
and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,

00:06:07.037 --> 00:06:10.024
General Electric, Philips, have already answered

00:06:10.024 --> 00:06:13.072
in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:17.067
and Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produce

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:20.069
products and services for the world.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.036
But of course, as an end user, you don't see that,

00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:24.087
because you only see the name of the company,

00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:28.064
not where it was developed.

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:31.048
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:33.072
the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center

00:06:33.072 --> 00:06:35.075
cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:38.010
of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers."

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.071
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be

00:06:39.071 --> 00:06:42.008
one of the smartest people I know, said

00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:43.053
he's going to do a study.

00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:46.019
What he did was he looked at those companies

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:49.090
that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.047
and then he looked at a patent that was filed

00:06:52.047 --> 00:06:55.018
out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.068
company's subsidiary in India,

00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:00.076
so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers

00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:04.077
in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company

00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:07.007
to find out what is the quality of the patents filed

00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:08.094
out of the Indian centers and how do they compare

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.073
with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?

00:07:11.073 --> 00:07:13.094
Interestingly, what he finds is

00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:16.065
— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:19.055
is what we call forward citations: How many times

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:23.072
does a future patent reference the older patent? —

00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:26.023
he finds something very interesting.

00:07:26.023 --> 00:07:28.091
What we find is that the data says

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:32.010
that the number of forward citations of a patent filed

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.051
out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number

00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:39.023
of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary

00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:41.044
of the same company within that company.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:44.035
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:46.086
citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:47.096
their U.S. subsidiaries.

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:51.078
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.

00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:54.033
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:58.003
is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,

00:07:58.003 --> 00:08:01.005
where many companies today are contracting

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:04.097
Indian companies to do a major part of their product

00:08:04.097 --> 00:08:09.038
development work for their global products

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.069
which are going to be sold to the entire world.

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.091
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:16.051
are being developed, but you see a major part of that work

00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:19.006
is being sent to India.

00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:22.007
For example, XCL Technologies,

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:24.099
they developed two of the mission critical systems

00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:28.019
for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:30.091
one to avoid collisions in the sky,

00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:34.015
and another to allow landing in zero visibility.

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:36.078
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:39.016
you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation

00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:40.043
out of India.

00:08:40.043 --> 00:08:43.044
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:46.043
is what we call process innovations, because of an injection

00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:49.016
of intelligence by Indian firms.

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:53.042
Process innovation is different from product innovation.

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:56.063
It's about how do you create a new product or develop

00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:58.063
a new product or manufacture a new product,

00:08:58.063 --> 00:09:00.067
but not a new product itself?

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:05.077
Only in India do millions of young people dream

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:09.096
of working in a call center.

00:09:09.096 --> 00:09:12.098
What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West,

00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:15.031
what high school dropouts do.

00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.043
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands

00:09:18.043 --> 00:09:21.059
of smart, young, ambitious kids

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:23.089
on a call center job?

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:28.079
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:32.009
and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:35.030
out of this process innovation comes product innovations,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.003
which are then marketed around the world.

00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:39.042
For example, 24/7 Customer,

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:41.071
traditional call center company, used to be a traditional

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:43.055
call center company. Today they're developing

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:47.000
analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.005
you pick up the phone, you can guess

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:56.078
or predict what this phone call is about.

00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:59.028
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process

00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:02.010
which was considered dead for a long time in the West.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.041
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.002
coming out of India is what we call management innovation.

00:10:08.002 --> 00:10:09.075
It's not a new product or a new process

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:12.010
but a new way to organize work,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.059
and the most significant management innovation to come

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:18.015
out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry

00:10:18.015 --> 00:10:20.080
is what we call the global delivery model.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.009
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:26.059
to take previously geographically core-located tasks,

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:29.060
break them up into parts, send them around the world

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.061
where the expertise and the cost structure exists,

00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:34.044
and then specify the means for reintegrating them.

00:10:34.044 --> 00:10:36.057
Without that, you could not have any of the other

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:38.085
invisible innovations today.

00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:41.049
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:46.012
in our research is, that if products for end users

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:49.041
is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:53.033
India is well represented in the invisible, large,

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:58.057
submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:03.053
Now, this has, of course, some implications,

00:11:03.053 --> 00:11:07.077
and so we developed three implications of this research.

00:11:07.077 --> 00:11:11.001
The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.073
and now I'm going to go back to where I started my

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:16.095
conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:20.008
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,

00:11:20.008 --> 00:11:22.090
decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.034
what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the

00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:29.042
bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:32.063
just like Tom Friedman would predict.

00:11:32.063 --> 00:11:35.035
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung

00:11:35.035 --> 00:11:40.017
of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work,

00:11:40.017 --> 00:11:43.040
at some stage in the very near future you are going to have

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.054
to confront a problem,

00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:47.043
which is where does the next step

00:11:47.043 --> 00:11:50.069
of the ladder people come from within your company?

00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:53.059
So you have two choices then:

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:55.077
Either you bring the people from India into

00:11:55.077 --> 00:11:58.068
the developed world to take positions in the next step

00:11:58.068 --> 00:12:01.042
of the ladder — immigration —

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:03.086
or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:06.050
of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.073
why don't we move the next step to India?

00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:12.068
What we are trying to say is

00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:17.091
that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --

00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:20.061
it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:23.034
and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.049
you can't be an investment banker

00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:27.048
without having been an analyst once.

00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:29.075
You can't be a professor without having been a student.

00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:32.061
You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.

00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:35.020
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.047
at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.

00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:41.032
The second thing we bring up is what we call

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:44.068
the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.

00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:47.032
If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of India

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.056
and China, and the largest growth markets

00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:51.080
are going to be based out of India and China,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.053
you have to confront the problem that

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:55.013
your top management of the future

00:12:55.015 --> 00:12:58.016
is going to have to come out of India and China,

00:12:58.016 --> 00:12:59.099
because that's where the product leadership is,

00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:02.015
that's where the important market leadership is.

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.093
Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,

00:13:04.093 --> 00:13:08.036
which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.

00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:12.042
India has the youngest growing population in the world.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:16.072
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,

00:13:16.072 --> 00:13:19.011
there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.

00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:22.004
Indian institutes and educational system,

00:13:22.004 --> 00:13:24.097
with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students

00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:27.047
in the quantity and quality needed

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:30.001
to keep this innovation engine going,

00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:33.022
so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,

00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:35.082
but in the end it does not absolve the government

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:40.029
of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:43.062
So finally, I want to conclude

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:46.094
by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.

00:13:46.094 --> 00:13:49.031
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered

00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:51.029
for the last hundred years to be one of the most

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:52.056
innovative companies.

00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:55.031
In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,

00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:57.071
I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies

00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:01.041
in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.091
Here is the profile of employees of

00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:07.084
IBM over the last decade.

00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:10.059
In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:14.068
or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000

00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:18.027
were in America, 9,000 were in India.

00:14:18.027 --> 00:14:23.030
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.087
the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,

00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:29.014
whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.

00:14:29.014 --> 00:14:32.016
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:34.048
this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:35.088
based on various sources.

00:14:35.088 --> 00:14:38.052
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying

00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:39.098
this is the exact number, it's my best guess.

00:14:39.098 --> 00:14:41.060
It gives you a sense of the trend.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.023
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:48.083
98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:52.039
and 150,000 are in India.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:55.051
So you tell me, is IBM an American company,

00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:59.057
or an Indian company? (Laughter)

00:14:59.057 --> 00:15:04.020
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
