00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:29.528
Thank you so much, Chris.

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:33.502
And it's truly a great honor
to have the opportunity

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:36.530
to come to this stage twice;
I'm extremely grateful.

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:40.088
I have been blown away by this conference,

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:45.780
and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:47.976
about what I had to say the other night.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.875
And I say that sincerely,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.863
partly because (Mock sob)

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:54.038
I need that.

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:59.919
(Laughter)

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:01.864
Put yourselves in my position.

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:08.416
(Laughter)

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.997
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.976
(Laughter)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.364
Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane!

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.093
(Laughter)

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:25.565
(Applause)

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:27.312
I'll tell you one quick story

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:30.455
to illustrate what
that's been like for me.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:34.444
It's a true story --
every bit of this is true.

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:38.743
Soon after Tipper and I left the --
(Mock sob) White House --

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:40.785
(Laughter)

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:45.724
we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have

00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:47.739
50 miles east of Nashville.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.490
Driving ourselves.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:52.976
(Laughter)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.717
I know it sounds like
a little thing to you, but --

00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:01.210
(Laughter)

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:06.941
I looked in the rear-view mirror

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:10.171
and all of a sudden it just hit me.

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:11.831
There was no motorcade back there.

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.509
(Laughter)

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.526
You've heard of phantom limb pain?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.362
(Laughter)

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:25.602
This was a rented Ford Taurus.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.130
(Laughter)

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.160
It was dinnertime,

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:33.104
and we started looking for a place to eat.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:34.993
We were on I-40.

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:38.214
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:41.926
We got off the exit,
we found a Shoney's restaurant.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.989
Low-cost family restaurant chain,
for those of you who don't know it.

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:51.312
We went in and sat down at the booth,
and the waitress came over,

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.322
made a big commotion over Tipper.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.809
(Laughter)

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:59.253
She took our order, and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us,

00:02:59.277 --> 00:03:01.381
and she lowered her voice so much,

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:04.406
I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.109
And she said "Yes, that's former
Vice President Al Gore

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:08.976
and his wife, Tipper."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.527
And the man said,

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:12.743
"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:17.675
(Laughter)

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.976
(Applause)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.119
There's been kind
of a series of epiphanies.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:26.287
(Laughter)

00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:29.976
The very next day,
continuing the totally true story,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.976
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.856
in the city of Lagos,
on the topic of energy.

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:43.097
And I began the speech
by telling them the story

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.834
of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville.

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:49.502
And I told it pretty much the same way
I've just shared it with you:

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:51.264
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:53.326
Shoney's, low-cost
family restaurant chain,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.283
what the man said -- they laughed.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:59.286
I gave my speech, then went back
out to the airport to fly back home.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.176
I fell asleep on the plane

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.738
until, during the middle
of the night, we landed

00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:05.976
on the Azores Islands for refueling.

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:09.476
I woke up, they opened the door,
I went out to get some fresh air,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.976
and I looked, and there was a man
running across the runway.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.055
And he was waving a piece
of paper, and he was yelling,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.153
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.426
And I thought to myself,
in the middle of the night,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.886
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.130
what in the world could be
wrong in Washington?

00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:29.415
Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.976
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.927
But what it turned out to be,

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:40.262
was that my staff was extremely upset

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:46.488
because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:47.932
about my speech,

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:49.932
and it had already been printed in cities

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.288
all across the United States of America.

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:54.140
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:55.314
(Laughter)

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:58.214
And the story began,

00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:02.531
"Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:06.184
'My wife Tipper and I have opened
a low-cost family restaurant'" --

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:07.850
(Laughter)

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.222
"'named Shoney's,

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:11.045
and we are running it ourselves.'"

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.389
(Laughter)

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:16.571
Before I could get back to U.S. soil,

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:20.709
David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on --

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:23.976
one of them had me
in a big white chef's hat,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.429
Tipper was saying,
"One more burger with fries!"

00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:27.500
(Laughter)

00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:28.806
Three days later,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.569
I got a nice, long, handwritten letter

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:35.014
from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:37.434
"Congratulations
on the new restaurant, Al!"

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:44.131
(Laughter)

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:47.292
We like to celebrate
each other's successes in life.

00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:52.713
(Laughter)

00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:56.153
I was going to talk
about information ecology.

00:05:56.177 --> 00:05:58.195
But I was thinking that,

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.976
since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.693
that maybe I could talk
about that another time.

00:06:04.717 --> 00:06:06.117
(Applause)

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.538
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!

00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:10.188
(Applause)

00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:14.730
Al Gore: I want to focus
on what many of you have said

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:16.620
you would like me to elaborate on:

00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:20.461
What can you do about the climate crisis?

00:06:21.317 --> 00:06:24.656
I want to start with a couple of --

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.249
I'm going to show some new images,

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:32.396
and I'm going to recapitulate
just four or five.

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:34.647
Now, the slide show.

00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.976
I update the slide show
every time I give it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.237
I add new images,

00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.166
because I learn more about it
every time I give it.

00:06:42.823 --> 00:06:44.774
It's like beach-combing, you know?

00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:47.976
Every time the tide comes in and out,
you find some more shells.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.983
Just in the last two days, we got
the new temperature records in January.

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:57.017
This is just for
the United States of America.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.779
Historical average
for Januarys is 31 degrees;

00:06:59.803 --> 00:07:03.487
last month was 39.5 degrees.

00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:08.745
Now, I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment --

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:09.937
I'm kidding.

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:13.460
But these are the recapitulation slides,

00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:16.878
and then I'm going to go into new
material about what you can do.

00:07:16.902 --> 00:07:19.297
But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these.

00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:22.632
First of all, this is where
we're projected to go

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.758
with the U.S. contribution
to global warming,

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:26.566
under business as usual.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.976
Efficiency in end-use electricity
and end-use of all energy

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.624
is the low-hanging fruit.

00:07:33.648 --> 00:07:38.152
Efficiency and conservation --
it's not a cost; it's a profit.

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:40.853
The sign is wrong.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.020
It's not negative; it's positive.

00:07:43.044 --> 00:07:45.884
These are investments
that pay for themselves.

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:49.779
But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.615
Cars and trucks -- I talked
about that in the slideshow,

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.131
but I want you to put it in perspective.

00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:02.490
It's an easy, visible target of concern --

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:03.976
and it should be --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.679
but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings

00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:10.425
than from cars and trucks.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.641
Cars and trucks are very significant,

00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:16.250
and we have the lowest
standards in the world.

00:08:16.274 --> 00:08:19.300
And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.

00:08:19.324 --> 00:08:24.685
Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:29.051
Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.822
can make this much difference.

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:36.801
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr
and others, many of you here --

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:39.392
there are a lot of people
directly involved in this --

00:08:39.416 --> 00:08:41.948
this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly

00:08:41.972 --> 00:08:44.159
than the current projection shows it.

00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:49.923
Carbon Capture and Sequestration --
that's what CCS stands for --

00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:56.762
is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:03.197
to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe.

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:05.795
Not quite there yet.

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:08.985
OK. Now, what can you do?

00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:13.252
Reduce emissions in your home.

00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:18.220
Most of these expenditures
are also profitable.

00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:20.976
Insulation, better design.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.689
Buy green electricity where you can.

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:28.246
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.976
Use light rail.

00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:33.287
Figure out some of the other options
that are much better.

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.476
It's important.

00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:36.973
Be a green consumer.

00:09:36.997 --> 00:09:39.976
You have choices with everything you buy,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.607
between things that have a harsh effect,

00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:49.131
or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.702
Consider this:

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:54.978
Make a decision to live
a carbon-neutral life.

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:58.097
Those of you who are good at branding,

00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:00.593
I'd love to get your advice and help

00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:06.695
on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people.

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:08.700
It is easier than you think.

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:10.040
It really is.

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:15.618
A lot of us in here
have made that decision,

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:17.776
and it is really pretty easy.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.727
It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions

00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:26.447
with the full range
of choices that you make,

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:30.596
and then purchase or acquire offsets

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.737
for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced.

00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:40.251
And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisis.net.

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:43.620
There is a carbon calculator.

00:10:44.501 --> 00:10:47.976
Participant Productions convened --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.570
with my active involvement --

00:10:50.594 --> 00:10:53.411
the leading software writers in the world,

00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:56.738
on this arcane science
of carbon calculation,

00:10:56.762 --> 00:11:00.864
to construct a consumer-friendly
carbon calculator.

00:11:01.317 --> 00:11:07.526
You can very precisely calculate
what your CO2 emissions are,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.868
and then you will be given
options to reduce.

00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:14.089
And by the time the movie
comes out in May,

00:11:14.113 --> 00:11:15.976
this will be updated to 2.0,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.434
and we will have click-through
purchases of offsets.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.222
Next, consider making
your business carbon-neutral.

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:24.854
Again, some of us have done that,

00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:26.884
and it's not as hard as you think.

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:32.386
Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.323
whether you are from the technology,

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:37.976
or entertainment, or design
and architecture community.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.043
Invest sustainably.

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.756
Majora mentioned this.

00:11:42.248 --> 00:11:49.040
Listen, if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate

00:11:49.064 --> 00:11:51.781
on the basis of their annual performance,

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:56.717
don't ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management.

00:11:57.807 --> 00:12:00.363
Over time, people do
what you pay them to do.

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:06.429
And if they judge how much
they're going to get paid

00:12:06.453 --> 00:12:09.753
on your capital that they've invested,

00:12:09.777 --> 00:12:11.720
based on the short-term returns,

00:12:11.744 --> 00:12:14.060
you're going to get short-term decisions.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:17.612
A lot more to be said about that.

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:19.382
Become a catalyst of change.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:23.041
Teach others, learn about it,
talk about it.

00:12:24.263 --> 00:12:27.668
The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:30.611
I gave two nights ago,
except it's a lot more entertaining.

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:33.841
And it comes out in May.

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:38.398
Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it.

00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:43.709
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.545
Pick well.

00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:50.827
And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow --

00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:55.606
re-purposed, with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.700
with a generic approach,

00:12:57.724 --> 00:13:00.423
and it's not just the slides,
it's what they mean.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.048
And it's how they link together.

00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:06.659
And so I'm going to be conducting
a course this summer

00:13:06.683 --> 00:13:10.518
for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks

00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:12.771
to come and then give it en masse,

00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.976
in communities all across the country,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.665
and we're going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week,

00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:22.720
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

00:13:22.744 --> 00:13:26.625
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,
somewhere in that process,

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:31.484
posted with tools
and limited-use copyrights,

00:13:31.508 --> 00:13:36.976
so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.146
(Applause)

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.660
Where did anybody get the idea

00:13:41.684 --> 00:13:44.036
that you ought to stay
arm's length from politics?

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.150
It doesn't mean
that if you're a Republican,

00:13:46.174 --> 00:13:48.498
that I'm trying to convince you
to be a Democrat.

00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:50.440
We need Republicans as well.

00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:52.473
This used to be a bipartisan issue,

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:54.954
and I know that
in this group it really is.

00:13:54.978 --> 00:13:56.530
Become politically active.

00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:59.427
Make our democracy work the way
it's supposed to work.

00:13:59.753 --> 00:14:05.302
Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions --

00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:07.341
global warming pollution --
and trading it.

00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:11.976
Here's why: as long as the United States
is out of the world system,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.668
it's not a closed system.

00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:17.739
Once it becomes a closed system,
with U.S. participation,

00:14:17.763 --> 00:14:19.986
then everybody
who's on a board of directors --

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.999
how many people here
serve on the board of directors

00:14:23.023 --> 00:14:24.277
of a corporation?

00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:26.841
Once it's a closed system,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:33.102
you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO

00:14:33.126 --> 00:14:37.253
to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.586
that can be avoided.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.275
The market will work
to solve this problem --

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:46.166
if we can accomplish this.

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:50.819
Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring.

00:14:50.843 --> 00:14:53.351
We have to change the minds
of the American people.

00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:56.134
Because presently, the politicians
do not have permission

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:58.077
to do what needs to be done.

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:03.809
And in our modern country, the role
of logic and reason no longer includes

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:06.787
mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did.

00:15:06.811 --> 00:15:12.371
It's now repetition of short, hot-button,
30-second, 28-second television ads.

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:14.253
We have to buy a lot of those ads.

00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:19.531
Let's re-brand global warming,
as many of you have suggested.

00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:22.424
I like "climate crisis"
instead of "climate collapse,"

00:15:22.448 --> 00:15:24.775
but again, those of you
who are good at branding,

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.204
I need your help on this.

00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:30.868
Somebody said the test
we're facing now, a scientist told me,

00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:33.976
is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.817
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.446
(Laughter)

00:15:38.825 --> 00:15:40.382
That's really true.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.560
I said the other night,
and I'll repeat now:

00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:48.749
this is not a political issue.

00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:54.312
Again, the Republicans here --
this shouldn't be partisan.

00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:57.976
You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do.

00:15:58.421 --> 00:15:59.897
This is an opportunity.

00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:04.773
Not just this, but connected
to the ideas that are here,

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.725
to bring more coherence to them.

00:16:07.495 --> 00:16:08.661
We are one.

00:16:09.065 --> 00:16:11.400
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

00:16:11.424 --> 00:16:17.666
(Applause)
