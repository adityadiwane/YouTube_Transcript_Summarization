00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
How does the news shape the way we see the world?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.330
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:49.330
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.330
that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.330
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.330
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.330
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.330
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.330
we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.330
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.330
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
here's how the world looked.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.330
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
And the cycle continues;

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
So, why don't we hear more about the world?

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.330
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.330
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.330
there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
-- places that are home to more than two billion people.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.330
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
when we see where people go for news.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Local TV news looms large,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
And what about the web?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
The most popular news sites don't do much better.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
that appeared on Google News' front page.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.330
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.330
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
as well as less educated Americans,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.330
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
you would be wrong.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.330
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
grew to over 50 percent.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:09.330
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
in our increasingly interconnected world?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
I know we can do better.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
And can we afford not to? Thank you.
