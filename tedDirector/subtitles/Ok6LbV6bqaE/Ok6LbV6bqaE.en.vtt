00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:19.090
It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.604
and I suddenly realized

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:25.058
that the next day was Mother's Day,

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.904
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.305
so I started thinking about

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.642
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.486
I thought, why don't I make her

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:35.535
an interactive Mother's Day card

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.243
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:42.060
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.440
We developed it so that people could easily create

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.684
their own interactive stories and games and animations,

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:53.453
and then share their creations with one another.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.321
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.221
to make an interactive card for my mom.

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.397
Before making my own Mother's Day card,

00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:04.382
I thought I would take a look

00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:05.955
at the Scratch website.

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:09.313
So over the last several years, kids around the world

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:12.507
ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:15.942
and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.327
whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:22.321
So in the search box I typed in

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.866
"Mother's Day,"

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.869
and I was surprised and delighted to see a list

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.573
of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.087
that showed up on the Scratch website,

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:34.405
many of them just in the past 24 hours

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:37.611
by procrastinators just like myself.

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:40.733
So I started taking a look at them. (Music)

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.189
I saw one of them that featured a kitten

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.060
and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.591
And the creator very considerately

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.095
offered a replay for her mom.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.479
Another one was an interactive project where,

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.677
when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:06.597
it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:10.580
(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.239
about how she had Googled to find out

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.356
when Mother's Day was happening.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:20.499
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.977
she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:26.604
of how much she loved her mom.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.829
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.481
and interacting with these projects.

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:34.322
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:39.076
I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.656
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:44.041
She wrote back to me and she said,

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.308
"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:51.420
that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.844
but actually I was even happier for another reason.

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:03.803
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:06.604
just in the way that we had hoped that they would.

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:09.415
As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:11.696
you could see that they were really

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:15.008
becoming fluent with new technologies.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:16.471
What do I mean by fluent?

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:20.503
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves

00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:23.280
and to start expressing their ideas.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.934
When you become fluent with language,

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.471
it means you can write an entry in your journal

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.524
or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:36.681
And it's similar with new technologies.

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:40.863
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:03:40.863 --> 00:03:43.393
these kids were showing that they were really fluent

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.066
with new technologies.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.831
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.527
because a lot of times people feel that

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:53.927
young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.

00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:58.388
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:02.185
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:05.686
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:08.239
When you really look at it, how is it that young people

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.775
spend most of their time using new technologies?

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:15.298
You often see them in situations like this,

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.492
or like this,

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.010
and there's no doubt that young people

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.326
are very comfortable and familiar browsing

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:26.848
and chatting and texting and gaming.

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:30.047
But that doesn't really make you fluent.

00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:34.006
So young people today have lots of experience

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.801
and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.206
but a lot less so of creating with new technologies

00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:44.178
and expressing themselves with new technologies.

00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:46.570
It's almost as if they can read

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.903
but not write with new technologies.

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:53.801
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.330
so they can write with new technologies?

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.690
And that really means that they need to be able to

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.202
write their own computer programs, or code.

00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:06.914
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:10.218
the importance of learning to code.

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:12.820
You know, in recent years, there have been

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.712
hundreds of new organizations and websites

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:19.006
that are helping young people learn to code.

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:22.597
You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy

00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:24.968
and events like CoderDojo

00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:27.399
and sites like Girls Who Code,

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.093
or Black Girls Code.

00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:32.201
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.

00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.784
You know, just at the beginning of this year,

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:36.149
at the turn of the new year,

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:38.809
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.069
made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.848
to code in 2012.

00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:47.016
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that

00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:50.672
all of its first graders should learn to code.

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.464
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.

00:05:53.464 --> 00:05:57.773
about whether all the children there should learn to code.

00:05:57.773 --> 00:06:00.616
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:04.224
it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.

00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:07.374
When many people think of coding, they think of it

00:06:07.374 --> 00:06:10.950
as something that only a very narrow sub-community

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.608
of people are going to be doing,

00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:16.530
and they think of coding looking like this.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.696
And in fact, if this is what coding is like,

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:21.191
it will only be a narrow sub-community of people

00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:24.263
with special mathematical skills and technological background

00:06:24.263 --> 00:06:26.529
that can code.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.029
But coding doesn't have to be like this.

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.008
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.

00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:37.287
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:39.202
In this case, you take a move block,

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:40.971
snap it into a stack,

00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.729
and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.247
of the different characters in your game or your story,

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.548
in this case controlling the big fish.

00:06:49.548 --> 00:06:52.999
After you've created your program, you can click on "share,"

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:56.075
and then share your project with other people,

00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:57.898
so that they can use the project

00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:00.872
and start working on the project as well.

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:04.194
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:05.839
you can do with Scratch.

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.819
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.643
there's everything from animated stories

00:07:10.643 --> 00:07:13.059
to school science projects

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.123
to anime soap operas

00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:17.445
to virtual construction kits

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:20.158
to recreations of classic video games

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:22.427
to political opinion polls

00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:25.067
to trigonometry tutorials

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.987
to interactive artwork, and, yes,

00:07:27.987 --> 00:07:30.771
interactive Mother's Day cards.

00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:33.807
So I think there's so many different ways

00:07:33.807 --> 00:07:37.267
that people can express themselves using this,

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:40.667
to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:43.229
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.996
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:49.475
Here's an example from Hong Kong,

00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:50.882
where some kids made a game

00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:54.163
and then built their own physical interface device

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:57.055
and had a light sensor, so the light sensor

00:07:57.055 --> 00:07:58.998
detects the hole in the board,

00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:01.198
so as they move the physical saw,

00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:03.438
the light sensor detects the hole

00:08:03.438 --> 00:08:06.394
and controls the virtual saw on the screen

00:08:06.394 --> 00:08:09.174
and saws down the tree.

00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:11.283
We're going to continue to look at new ways

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:14.339
of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:17.267
and connecting to the world around us.

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:19.500
This is an example from a new version of Scratch

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.123
that we'll be releasing in the next few months,

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:25.173
and we're looking again to be able

00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:26.869
to push you in new directions.

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:29.133
Here's an example.

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:33.207
It uses the webcam.

00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:38.063
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons

00:08:38.063 --> 00:08:40.948
or I can move the bug.

00:08:40.948 --> 00:08:43.513
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,

00:08:43.513 --> 00:08:46.229
where you interact with gestures in the world.

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:48.473
But instead of just playing someone else's game,

00:08:48.473 --> 00:08:50.715
you get to create the games,

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.098
and if you see someone else's game,

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.738
you can just say "see inside,"

00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:57.632
and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.

00:08:57.632 --> 00:09:01.187
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,

00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:04.308
and then, if there's so much video motion,

00:09:04.308 --> 00:09:07.687
it will then tell the balloon to pop.

00:09:07.687 --> 00:09:10.071
The same way that this uses the camera

00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.576
to get information into Scratch,

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:15.583
you can also use the microphone.

00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:19.567
Here's an example of a project using the microphone.

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:21.967
So I'm going to let all of you control this game

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:24.213
using your voices.

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:40.669
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:49.298
(Laughter)

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:58.082
(Applause)

00:09:58.082 --> 00:10:00.687
As kids are creating projects like this,

00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:02.952
they're learning to code,

00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:06.886
but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:09.175
Because as they learn to code,

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:12.495
it enables them to learn many other things,

00:10:12.495 --> 00:10:15.367
opens up many new opportunities for learning.

00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:19.751
Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.

00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:22.691
When you learn to read and write, it opens up

00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:25.751
opportunities for you to learn so many other things.

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:29.511
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:31.699
And it's the same thing with coding.

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.246
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:36.800
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.298
You learn more about how computers work.

00:10:39.298 --> 00:10:41.616
But that's just where it starts.

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:44.211
When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.456
many other things.

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:48.802
Let me show you an example.

00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:51.072
Here's another project,

00:10:51.072 --> 00:10:53.340
and I saw this when I was visiting

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.482
one of the computer clubhouses.

00:10:55.482 --> 00:10:58.502
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start

00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:01.264
that help young people from low-income communities

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:05.343
learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.

00:11:05.343 --> 00:11:08.138
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,

00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:11.863
I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software

00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:14.759
to create a game somewhat like this one,

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:17.682
and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,

00:11:17.682 --> 00:11:20.647
but also he wanted to do more.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.951
He wanted to keep score.

00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:26.027
So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:26.027 --> 00:11:28.954
but he wanted to keep score, so that each time

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:32.332
the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:32.332 --> 00:11:34.871
the score would go up and it would keep track,

00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:37.383
and he didn't know how to do that.

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:39.648
So I showed him.

00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:43.225
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.

00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:47.352
I'll call it score.

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:50.183
And that creates some new blocks for you,

00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:54.849
and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,

00:11:54.849 --> 00:12:00.101
so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.

00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:02.626
So I showed this to the clubhouse member --

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:05.327
let's call him Victor -- and Victor,

00:12:05.327 --> 00:12:08.129
when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:09.945
he knew exactly what to do.

00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:12.259
He took the block

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:15.303
and he put it into the program

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:19.496
exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:24.519
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:30.514
he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.

00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:32.211
And it's in fact working.

00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:34.465
And he saw this, and he was so excited,

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:36.144
he reached his hand out to me,

00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:38.693
and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:40.762
And what went through my mind was,

00:12:40.762 --> 00:12:43.804
how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:47.207
for teaching them variables? (Laughter)

00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:49.688
It doesn't happen in most classrooms,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:52.647
but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.155
they don't know why they're learning it.

00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:58.026
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.

00:12:58.026 --> 00:13:00.188
When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,

00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:04.291
you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:07.281
that you can understand the reason for learning variables,

00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:09.323
and we see that kids learn it more deeply

00:13:09.323 --> 00:13:10.738
and learn it better.

00:13:10.738 --> 00:13:13.779
Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:15.967
but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.

00:13:15.967 --> 00:13:18.250
Now he had a reason for learning variables.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.324
So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,

00:13:21.324 --> 00:13:26.208
you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:29.663
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,

00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:32.447
they're learning important concepts like variables,

00:13:32.447 --> 00:13:34.575
but that's just the start.

00:13:34.575 --> 00:13:38.425
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,

00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:41.677
he was also learning about the process of design,

00:13:41.677 --> 00:13:44.296
how to start with the glimmer of an idea

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:47.202
and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:49.709
like you see here.

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:53.749
So he was learning many different core principles of design,

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:56.991
about how to experiment with new ideas,

00:13:56.991 --> 00:14:01.696
how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:04.686
how to collaborate with other people on your projects,

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:08.137
about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,

00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:11.191
how to keep persistent and to persevere

00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:14.596
in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.

00:14:14.596 --> 00:14:16.369
Now those are important skills

00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:19.237
that aren't just relevant for coding.

00:14:19.237 --> 00:14:22.064
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.

00:14:22.064 --> 00:14:25.232
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:28.156
a programmer or a professional computer scientist?

00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:29.968
It's probably not so likely,

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:31.756
but regardless of what he does,

00:14:31.756 --> 00:14:35.460
he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.044
Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:41.164
or a mechanic or a community organizer,

00:14:41.164 --> 00:14:43.620
that these ideas are useful for everybody.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.542
Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.

00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:51.898
When you become fluent with reading and writing,

00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:54.339
it's not something that you're doing

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:56.299
just to become a professional writer.

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:58.996
Very few people become professional writers.

00:14:58.996 --> 00:15:02.564
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.

00:15:02.564 --> 00:15:04.659
Again, the same thing with coding.

00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:06.881
Most people won't grow up to become professional

00:15:06.881 --> 00:15:10.100
computer scientists or programmers,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.438
but those skills of thinking creatively,

00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:14.952
reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --

00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:17.662
skills you develop when you code in Scratch --

00:15:17.662 --> 00:15:22.484
are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.860
And it's not just about your work life.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.580
Coding can also enable you to

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.756
express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.

00:15:30.756 --> 00:15:33.429
Let me end with just one more example.

00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:36.556
So this is an example that came from

00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:41.024
after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:44.125
she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:47.156
So she made this project for my birthday

00:15:47.156 --> 00:15:50.732
and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.

00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:54.588
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,

00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:57.563
and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom

00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:01.800
is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.772
But working on this project enabled her

00:16:04.772 --> 00:16:07.438
to make a connection to someone that she cares about

00:16:07.438 --> 00:16:10.246
and enabled her to keep on learning new things

00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:12.678
and continuing to practice her creativity

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.853
and developing new ways of expressing herself.

00:16:15.853 --> 00:16:20.064
So as we take a look and we see that

00:16:20.064 --> 00:16:22.628
Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,

00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:25.278
all of the children of Estonia learn to code,

00:16:25.278 --> 00:16:27.478
even my mom has learned to code,

00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:29.250
don't you think it's about time that you might be

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.162
thinking about learning to code?

00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:33.355
If you're interested in giving it a try,

00:16:33.355 --> 00:16:35.791
I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.816
It's scratch.mit.edu,

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:39.638
and give a try at coding.

00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:43.756
Thanks very much. (Applause)
