00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.330
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
things that can be measured and described --

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
In the Extreme Ice Survey,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
to merging the art and science

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
to the end of helping us understand nature

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.330
and humanity's relationship with nature better.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Specifically, I as a person

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
have tremendous powers for helping us understand

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
and shape the way we think about nature

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
and about ourselves in relationship to nature.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.330
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
the malleability of it,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
These first images are from Greenland.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
But ice has another meaning.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.330
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
is it raining more or is it raining less?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.330
What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
where the ice is, it's real and it's present.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
The changes are happening. They're very visible.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
They're photographable. They're measurable.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.330
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
That's outside Antarctica.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
There is no significant scientific dispute about that.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And the great irony and tragedy of our time

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
Science is not arguing about that.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330
In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.330
because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.330
as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.330
When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
I decided that one day I would do a project

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.330
looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
And that led me to this project.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
conventional, single frame, still photography.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
after that assignment was finished --

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
that I should station a camera or two at a glacier

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
and watch the progression of the landscape over time.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Well, within about three weeks,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
into 25 time-lapse cameras.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.330
trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
that tells the camera when to fire.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
and they watch the evolution of the landscape.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.330
We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
(Laughter)

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
I spent half my life at our local hardware store

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
during the months when we built these units originally.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.330
We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
and we have repeat photography positions,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
that is places we just visit on an annual basis,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
as an ambassador for my whole team.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
There's a lot of people working on this right now.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.330
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
We've been out for two and a half years,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
That's only half our job.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.330
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.330
off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.330
and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and like our relationship with the Obama White House,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
as much as possible with these pictures as well.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.330
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
We have a site on Google Earth

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
that Google Earth was generous enough to give us,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.330
because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
there would be no further societal argument about climate change

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
because this is the story that counts.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.330
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
This exact same pattern is seen going back now

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
almost a million years before our current time.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
And several things are important.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
go up and down basically in sync.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:58.330
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
That's the natural cycle.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
Goes up to 280 and then drops

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
But 280 is the peak.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
we're at 385 parts per million.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.330
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Earth is having a fever.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.330
has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
and it's going to keep going up

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
We have to turn that around.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
But anyway, off to the world of ice.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
This is a view of what's called the calving face.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
You see the glacier flowing in from the right,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
If you look in the middle background,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
that calving face in this picture

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.330
is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:30.330
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.330
but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.330
going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and floating if it isn't.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.330
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
This is an aerial picture we did this year.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
That's the retreat of this glacier.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.330
The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and it's going very rapidly up that stem.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.330
and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
because as the glaciers --

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
they're not normal landscapes --

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
like air is being let out of a balloon.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
And so, there are features on this landscape.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.330
There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
that shows you that a little bit.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
There's a marker line called the trim line

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
above our little red illustration there.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.330
has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
It's not static.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
Particularly in the world of sea ice,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.330
the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
and the processes either are accelerating

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
or the predictions were too low to begin with.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.330
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.330
So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
And you see where it ended in these various spring days,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
June, May, then October.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
Now we turn on our time lapse.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
This camera was shooting every hour.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
Geologic process in action here.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
And you can look at these pictures over and over again

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.330
because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
these things you don't normally get to see come alive.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
We've been talking about "seeing is believing "

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
and seeing the unseen at TED Global.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
That's what you see with these cameras.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.330
The images make the invisible visible.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
These huge crevasses open up.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
These great ice islands break off --

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
and now watch this.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
This has been the springtime this year --

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
a huge collapse. That happened in about a month,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
the loss of all that ice.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
So that's where we started three years ago,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
last time we went into Columbia.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
we did another cheesy illustration,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
with British double-decker buses.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.330
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
It's a long way.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
On up to Iceland.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
You can see this river being formed.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
You can see it deflating.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
but the camera records it.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
So we wind time backwards now.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
We go back a couple years in time.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
That's where it started.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.330
That's where it ended a few months ago.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
And on up to Greenland.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.330
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Greenland took a little while to start reacting

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
to the warming climate of the past century,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.330
but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
It's a big place. That's all ice.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.330
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.330
just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
The one glacier up in Greenland

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
that puts more ice into the global ocean

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
is the Ilulissat Glacier.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.330
watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:21.330
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
The calving face is four and a half miles across,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
So, imagine how big this is

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
and how much ice is charging out.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
The interior of Greenland is to the right.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:41.330
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.330
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
as you can see. June 25th,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
monster calving events happened.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
I'll show you one of those in a second.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.330
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
but on average, 125 feet a day,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
twice the rate it did 20 years ago.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.330
Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
We had nine cameras going.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.330
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
Huge icebergs rolling over.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.330
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.330
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.330
A mile of retreat in 75 minutes

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.330
across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
and if you compare the expanse of the calving face

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.330
to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.330
and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.330
it would be equivalent to how large that block was.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.330
75 minutes.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
Now I've come to the conclusion

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330
after spending a lot of time in this climate change world

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.330
that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.330
We have a problem of perception.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.330
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
but we actually can deal with them.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
I'm certain that we can.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
But what we have is a perception problem

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.330
because not enough people really get it yet.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
You're an elite audience. You get it.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.330
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.330
are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.330
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.330
And that's where I think organizations like TED,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.330
like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.330
on human perception and bring us along.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.330
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.330
We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.330
but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.330
of our generation and, in fact, of our century.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.330
This is a terrific, terrific call to arms

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.330
to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.330
I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.330
rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:14.330
(Applause)
