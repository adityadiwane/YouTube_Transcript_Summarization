00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.179
As an architect, I often ask myself,

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.019
what is the origin of the forms that we design?

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.924
What kind of forms could we design

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:26.747
if we wouldn't work with references anymore?

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:30.132
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:32.339
what kind of forms could we design

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.939
if we could free ourselves from

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:36.075
our experience?

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:40.809
If we could free ourselves from our education?

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.836
What would these unseen forms look like?

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:47.547
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.962
Would they delight us?

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:53.883
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:56.275
I propose we look to nature.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.539
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.127
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature,

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:06.507
I'm not saying we should mimic biology,

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:09.955
instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:14.409
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.287
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:22.116
is the splitting of one cell into two cells.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.173
And these cells can either be identical,

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:26.348
or they can be distinct from each other

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:28.412
through asymmetric cell division.

00:01:28.412 --> 00:01:32.211
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:34.444
then we could start with a single sheet of paper,

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.940
one surface, and we could make a fold

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.876
and divide the surface into two surfaces.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.139
We're free to choose where we make the fold.

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:47.049
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.943
Through this very simple process,

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:52.555
we can create an astounding variety of forms.

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:55.280
Now, we can take this form and use the same process

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.272
to generate three-dimensional structures,

00:01:57.272 --> 00:01:59.680
but rather than folding things by hand,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.265
we'll bring the structure into the computer,

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:05.240
and code it as an algorithm.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.248
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.

00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:10.407
We can fold a million times faster,

00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:13.568
we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.

00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:16.048
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:19.264
we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.617
A simple volume, the cube.

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:22.337
If we take its surfaces and fold them

00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:24.393
again and again and again and again,

00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:27.256
then after 16 iterations, 16 steps,

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:31.105
we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,

00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:33.640
for instance, like this.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.352
And if we change where we make the folds,

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:37.993
if we change the folding ratio,

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:41.416
then this cube turns into this one.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:45.555
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.382
or this shape.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:49.005
So we exert control over the form

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.509
by specifying the position of where we're making the fold,

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:57.215
but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.

00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:58.279
And we can play with this.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.895
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:03.640
of the form to create local conditions.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.583
We can begin to sculpt the form.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.471
And because we're doing the folding on the computer,

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.167
we are completely free of any physical constraints.

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:15.118
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,

00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:16.607
they can become impossibly small.

00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:20.208
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.086
Surfaces can become porous.

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:24.815
They can stretch. They can tear.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:29.450
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.200
But in each case, I didn't design the form.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.801
I designed the process that generated the form.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:41.289
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:42.884
which is what you're seeing here,

00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:46.657
then the form changes correspondingly.

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:48.913
But that's only half of the story --

00:03:48.913 --> 00:03:53.236
99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this,

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:58.132
but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:00.252
The forms that I showed before were made actually

00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:01.900
through very long trial and error.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.116
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found,

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:09.004
is to use information that is already contained in forms.

00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.659
A very simple form such as this one actually contains

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.251
a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.732
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:21.068
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.

00:04:21.068 --> 00:04:24.645
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:28.732
how radial they are -- all information that may not be

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:30.679
instantly visible to you,

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:33.104
but that we can bring out, that we can articulate,

00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:36.480
and that we can use to control the folding.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.439
So now I'm not specifying a single

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.615
ratio anymore to fold it,

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:43.167
but instead I'm establishing a rule,

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:45.603
I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:48.576
and how that surface is folded.

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:51.527
And because I've designed the process and not the form,

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:53.849
I can run the process again and again and again

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.384
to produce a whole family of forms.

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:13.088
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:14.217
There is a simple input,

00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:16.169
it's always a cube that I start with,

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.745
and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold,

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:23.697
and doing this over and over again.

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:25.977
So let's bring this process to architecture.

00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:27.577
How? And at what scale?

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.305
I chose to design a column.

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:32.681
Columns are architectural archetypes.

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:35.748
They've been used throughout history to express ideals

00:05:35.748 --> 00:05:40.823
about beauty, about technology.

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:42.745
A challenge to me was how we could express

00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:46.041
this new algorithmic order in a column.

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:49.025
I started using four cylinders.

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.801
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:55.936
eventually evolved into this.

00:05:55.936 --> 00:06:00.552
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.

00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:03.070
We can begin to zoom into them.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.625
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:10.297
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.

00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:12.249
And unlike traditional architecture,

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.033
it's a single process that creates both the overall form

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:20.378
and the microscopic surface detail.

00:06:20.378 --> 00:06:23.069
These forms are undrawable.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.445
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper

00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:28.237
would probably take months,

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.621
or it would take even a year to draw all the sections,

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.925
all of the elevations, you can only create something like this

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.061
through an algorithm.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.093
The more interesting question, perhaps, is,

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:39.722
are these forms imaginable?

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:42.357
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:44.221
of what he is designing.

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:47.046
In this case, the process is deterministic.

00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:49.405
There's no randomness involved at all,

00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:51.412
but it's not entirely predictable.

00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:52.988
There's too many surfaces,

00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:56.598
there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.

00:06:56.598 --> 00:06:59.812
So this leads to a new role for the architect.

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:03.423
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.199
that are out there.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.431
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form,

00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:10.645
in parallel, and one can cultivate them.

00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:12.893
And to go back to the analogy with nature,

00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:15.389
one can begin to think in terms of populations,

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.917
one can talk about permutations, about generations,

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:23.780
about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.165
And the architect is really, he moves into the position

00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:29.597
of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.

00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:31.941
But enough of the theory.

00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.468
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside

00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:38.297
this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue

00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:41.233
3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:43.305
but still that wasn't the same as being able to

00:07:43.305 --> 00:07:45.657
walk around and touch things.

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.560
So there was only one possibility --

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.657
to bring the column out of the computer.

00:07:50.657 --> 00:07:53.577
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.

00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:56.536
For me, or for my purpose at this moment,

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:59.618
there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff

00:07:59.618 --> 00:08:06.401
between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.

00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:08.658
So instead, we decided to take the column,

00:08:08.658 --> 00:08:11.097
and we decided to build it as a layered model,

00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:15.225
made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:17.122
What you're looking at here is an X-ray

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.897
of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.

00:08:19.897 --> 00:08:21.897
Unbeknownst to me at the time,

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:24.273
because we had only seen the outside,

00:08:24.273 --> 00:08:26.433
the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.697
to grow on the inside of the column,

00:08:28.697 --> 00:08:31.243
which was quite a surprising discovery.

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:34.857
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line,

00:08:34.857 --> 00:08:37.881
and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter

00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.695
to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here --

00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:46.586
very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.553
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:53.353
and the column that we ended up with

00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:56.400
after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.110
that we had designed in the computer.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.231
Almost all of the details, almost all of the

00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:05.271
surface intricacies were preserved.

00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:10.232
But it was very labor intensive.

00:09:10.232 --> 00:09:12.633
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:15.393
between the virtual and the physical.

00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:17.519
It took me several months to design the column,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.237
but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds

00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:23.085
to calculate all of the 16 million faces.

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:25.046
The physical model, on the other hand,

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:29.254
is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,

00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:33.401
it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover

00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:35.539
this entire auditorium.

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.627
And the cutting path that the laser followed

00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:42.744
goes from here to the airport and back again.

00:09:42.744 --> 00:09:44.493
But it is increasingly possible.

00:09:44.493 --> 00:09:47.104
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,

00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:49.864
and there's some promising technological developments

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:51.647
just on the horizon.

00:09:51.647 --> 00:09:54.719
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.243
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,

00:09:58.243 --> 00:10:00.097
we used the bigger, faster machine,

00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:03.154
and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,

00:10:03.154 --> 00:10:06.130
they can bear loads for once.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.145
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.

00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:11.554
You can see a different column in the mirror,

00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:13.604
if there's a mirror behind the column

00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:16.676
that creates a sort of an optical illusion.

00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:18.522
So where does this leave us?

00:10:18.522 --> 00:10:22.990
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.873
if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,

00:10:26.873 --> 00:10:30.266
but a process to generate objects.

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:33.539
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:36.387
there's countless other ones.

00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:39.834
In short, we have no constraints.

00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:43.404
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now

00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:47.985
that allow us to create structures at all scales

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:51.017
that we couldn't even have dreamt up.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:55.836
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.

00:10:55.836 --> 00:11:02.459
Thank you. (Applause)
