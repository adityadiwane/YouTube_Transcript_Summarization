00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
"People do stupid things.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
That's what spreads HIV."

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The Guardian, not that long ago.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Well, one or two brave souls.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
worked on four continents,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and you're looking at her.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And I am now going to argue

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
that this is only half true.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
but most of them are doing stupid things

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
for perfectly rational reasons.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in public health,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
you'll see that if we give people the information that they need

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
about what's good for them and what's bad for them,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
if you give them the services

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
that they can use to act on that information,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and a little bit of motivation,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
people will make rational decisions

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and live long and healthy lives.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Wonderful.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and although I'm sure you all know

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and if you were at TED '07

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
it's about coffee prices ...

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and if there are two things that make

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
human beings a little bit irrational,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
they are erections and addiction.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
(Laughter)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We were having lunch and he was telling me

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
smuggled some heroin into jail,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and he was very generously sharing it out

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
with all of his colleagues.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And so everyone lined up,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
all the smackheads in a row,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and the guy whose birthday it was

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
filled up the fit,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and he went down and started injecting people.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So he injects the first guy,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and he injects the next guy.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and I can see the needle coming down towards me,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and there is blood all over the place.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
It's getting blunter and blunter.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And a small part of my brain is thinking,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
'That is so gross

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and really dangerous,'

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
but most of my brain is thinking,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
'Please let there be some smack left

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
by the time it gets to me.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Please let there be some left.'"

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And then, telling me this story,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Frankie said,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
"You know ... God,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
drugs really make you stupid."

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
But, actually, Frankie, at that time,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
was a heroin addict and he was in jail.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
So his choice was either

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And if there's one place you really want to get high,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
it's when you're in jail.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
But I'm a scientist

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
so let's look at some data.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
We talked to 600 drug addicts

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
in three cities in Indonesia,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
at a price you can afford to avoid that?"

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
"So are you carrying a needle?"

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
We're actually interviewing people on the street,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
"Are you carrying clean needles?"

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
One in four, maximum.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So no surprises then that

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
the proportion that actually used clean needles

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
every time they injected in the last week

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
is just about one in 10,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and the other nine in 10 are sharing.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So you've got this massive mismatch;

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
everyone knows that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
if they share they're going to get HIV,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
but they're all sharing anyway.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
There's just kind of an ick factor there.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So, in Indonesia at this time,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
they could put you into jail.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Because your choice now is either

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I use my own needle now,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
or I could share a needle now

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and get a disease that's going to

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
possibly kill me 10 years from now,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
or I could use my own needle now

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and go to jail tomorrow.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And while junkies think that

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
they think it's a much worse idea

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
to spend the next year in jail

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and expose themselves to HIV anyway.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
to share needles.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
This is a really easy problem.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
For once, your incentives are aligned.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
We've got what's rational for public health.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
You want people to use clean needles --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and junkies want to use clean needles.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So we could make this problem go away

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
simply by making clean needles universally available

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and taking away the fear of arrest.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Now, the first person to figure that out

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and do something about it on a national scale

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Margaret Thatcher.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And she put in the world's first

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
national needle exchange program,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And in all of those countries, you can see,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
not more than four percent of injectors

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
ever became infected with HIV.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Moscow, Jakarta --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
we're talking, at its peak,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
one in two injectors

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
infected with this fatal disease.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
because she has any great love for junkies.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
She did it because she ran a country

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that had a national health service.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
she was going to have pick up the costs

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
of treatment later on,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and obviously those are much higher.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
So she was making a politically rational decision.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Now, if I take out my

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
public health nerd glasses here

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and look at these data,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
But in this country,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
where the government apparently does not feel compelled

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
we've taken a very different approach.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So what we've been doing in the United States

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
by all the big muckety-mucks

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
of the scientific pantheon in the United States,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and these are the studies that show

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
but no -- that's the whole slide.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
(Laughter)

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
There is nothing on the other side.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, completely irrational,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
you would think.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and they're responding to what they think the voters want.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So what we see is that voters respond

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
very well to things like this

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and not quite so well to things like this.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:51.260
(Laughter)

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So it becomes quite rational

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
to deny services to injectors.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Now let's talk about sex.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Are we any more rational about sex?

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Well, I'm not even going to address

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
the clearly irrational positions

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of people like the Catholic Church,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
who think somehow that if you give out condoms,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
everyone's going to run out and have sex.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
I don't know if Pope Benedict

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
watches TEDTalks online,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
I carry condoms all the time

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and I never get laid.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
It's not that easy!

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:39.260
(Applause)

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Okay, seriously,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
HIV is actually not that easy

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to transmit sexually.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So, it depends on how much virus there is

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
in your blood and in your body fluids.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
right at the beginning when you're first infected,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
then you start making antibodies,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and then it bumps along at quite low levels

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
But basically, nothing much is going on

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and by that stage,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
you're not having that much sex.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
So the sexual transmission of HIV

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
is essentially determined by how many partners you have

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in these very short spaces of time

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
when you have peak viremia.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Now, this makes people crazy

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
because it means that you have to talk about

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
some groups having more sexual partners

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in shorter spaces of time than other groups,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and that's considered stigmatizing.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I've always been a bit curious about that

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
because I think stigma is a bad thing,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
but we'll leave that be.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
The truth is that 20 years

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
of very good research

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
have shown us that

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
there are groups that are more likely to turnover

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
large numbers of partners in a short space of time.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And those groups are, globally,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
people who sell sex and their more regular partners.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
They are gay men on the party scene

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
who have, on average, three times more partners

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
than straight people on the party scene.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And they are heterosexuals

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
who come from countries that have

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
traditions of polygamy

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and relatively high levels of female autonomy,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
These are all countries in southern Africa

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
where between one in seven,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and one in three

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
of all adults,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
are infected with HIV.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Now, in the rest of the world,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
very, very low levels --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
in these other populations who are at highest risk:

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
drug injectors, sex workers

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and gay men.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
25 percent prevalence among gay men.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
with a positive person.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
In most of the world,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
these few prevention failures

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
notwithstanding,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
we are actually doing quite well these days

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
in commercial sex:

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
in commercial sex in most countries.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
What's rational for public health

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
is also rational for individual sex workers

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
because it's really bad for business to have another STI.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
No one wants it.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
So essentially, you're able to achieve

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
But in "intimate" relations

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
it's much more difficult because,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
with your wife or your boyfriend

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
we have this illusion of romance

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and trust and intimacy,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and nothing is quite so unromantic

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
So in the face of that,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
you really need quite a strong incentive

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
to use condoms.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
but he is a reminder in the population,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
of why you might want to be

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
using condoms.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
after six months on antiretroviral treatment.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
But it is changing the equation

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
of what's rational

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
in sexual decision-making.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
So, what we've got --

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
because, actually, treatment is effective prevention

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
because it lowers your viral load and therefore

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
So, if you look at the viremia thing again,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
if you do start treatment when you're sick,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Well, you die,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
so your viral load goes to zero.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.260
which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
and forgot to take your drugs,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
all of that is virus

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Let's just stop treating people."

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
Of course not, of course not.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
But what I am doing is calling into question

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
those people who say that more treatment

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
is all the prevention we need.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
That's simply not necessarily true,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
for going on 15 years now.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And what we've seen is

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
that, actually, condom use rates,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
which were very, very high --

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
with extremely little help

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
from public health nerds, I would say --

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
for two reasons really:

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
One is the assumption of, "Oh well,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
if he's infected, he's probably on meds,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And the other thing is that people are simply

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
not as scared of HIV

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and HIV is an invisible virus

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
that makes you take a pill every day.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
And that's boring,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
but is it as boring as

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
having to use a condom every time you have sex,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
no matter how drunk you are,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
If we look at the data, we can see that

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
the answer to that question

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
is, mmm.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
So these are data from Scotland.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
You see the peak in drug injectors

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
before they started the national needle exchange program.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Then it came way down.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and in drug users,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and that's because of that alignment of incentives

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
that I talked about earlier.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
But in gay men,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
you've got quite a dramatic rise

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
starting three or four years

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
after treatment became widely available.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
This is of new infections.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
What does that mean?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
It means that the combined effect of being less worried

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and having more virus out there in the population --

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
more people living longer, healthier lives,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
more likely to be getting laid

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
with HIV --

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and that's a very worrisome thing.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
What does it mean?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Is that what's happening?

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and what's happening really is that people are

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
unable quite to bring themselves to put in

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
But once they've gone from being

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
to being AIDS victims,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
we come over all compassionate

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
It doesn't make any sense

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
from a public health point of view.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.260
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
she's a chick with a dick.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Why does she do that job?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Well, of course, because she's forced into it

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
And if we could just teach her to sew

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
on average, 20 cents.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
It varies a bit province to province.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
for this particular slide,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
and this is what sex workers

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
say they earn in an hour.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
it really is quite a rational choice.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
Okay, Ines.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:20.260
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and commitment to preventing HIV too.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
It's all politics.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
So, from the point of view of a sex worker,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
politicians are making no sense.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
From the point of view of a public health nerd,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
junkies are doing dumb things.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
There are as many different ways of being rational

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
as there are human beings on the planet,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
and that's one of the glories of human existence.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
But those ways of being rational

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
are not independent of one another,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
so it's rational for

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
a drug injector to share needles

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
and it's rational for a politician

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
to make that stupid decision

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
because they're responding to

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
what they think the voters want.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
But here's the thing:

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
we are the voters.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And everyone who's in this room,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
and everyone who's watching this out there on the web,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
that we make policy based on scientific evidence

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
and on common sense.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
It's going to be really hard for us

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
to individually affect what's rational

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
for every Frankie and every Ines out there,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
but you can at least use your vote

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
to stop politicians doing stupid things

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
that spread HIV.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
Thank you.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:05.260
(Applause)
