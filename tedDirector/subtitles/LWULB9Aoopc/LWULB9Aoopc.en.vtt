00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:16.833
What I'd like to do today is talk
about one of my favorite subjects,

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:19.759
and that is the neuroscience of sleep.

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.096
Now, there is a sound --

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.126
(Alarm clock)

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.166
Ah, it worked!

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.768
A sound that is desperately
familiar to most of us,

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:33.132
and of course it's the sound
of the alarm clock.

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:36.323
And what that truly ghastly,
awful sound does

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:41.714
is stop the single most important
behavioral experience

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:43.708
that we have, and that's sleep.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.986
If you're an average sort of person,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.409
36 percent of your life
will be spent asleep,

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.644
which means that if you live to 90,

00:00:54.668 --> 00:01:00.240
then 32 years will have
been spent entirely asleep.

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:06.186
Now what that 32 years is telling us
is that sleep at some level is important.

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:09.812
And yet, for most of us,
we don't give sleep a second thought.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.645
We throw it away.

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:14.216
We really just don't think about sleep.

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.516
And so what I'd like to do today
is change your views,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.715
change your ideas
and your thoughts about sleep.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.106
And the journey
that I want to take you on,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.548
we need to start by going back in time.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:32.291
"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.585
Any ideas who said that?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.975
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.999
Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.

00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.571
"O sleep, O gentle sleep,
nature's soft nurse,

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:47.920
how have I frighted thee?"

00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:50.517
Shakespeare again, from --
I won't say it --

00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:51.915
the Scottish play.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.190
(Laughter)

00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:55.807
From the same time:

00:01:55.831 --> 00:02:00.036
"Sleep is the golden chain
that ties health and our bodies together."

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.239
Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,
another Elizabethan dramatist.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:07.654
But if we jump forward 400 years,

00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:11.019
the tone about sleep changes somewhat.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:14.214
This is from Thomas Edison,
from the beginning of the 20th century:

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.874
"Sleep is a criminal waste of time
and a heritage from our cave days."

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:19.081
Bang!

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.146
(Laughter)

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:26.765
And if we also jump into the 1980s,
some of you may remember

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.139
that Margaret Thatcher
was reported to have said,

00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:30.604
"Sleep is for wimps."

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:33.499
And of course the infamous --
what was his name? --

00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:35.961
the infamous Gordon Gekko
from "Wall Street" said,

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.885
"Money never sleeps."

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.116
What do we do in the 20th
century about sleep?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.481
Well, of course, we use
Thomas Edison's light bulb

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.327
to invade the night,
and we occupied the dark,

00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:50.112
and in the process of this occupation,

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.717
we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:55.116
We've treated it as an enemy.

00:02:55.677 --> 00:03:01.044
At most now, I suppose,
we tolerate the need for sleep,

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:03.235
and at worst perhaps
many of us think of sleep

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.223
as an illness that needs
some sort of a cure.

00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:09.556
And our ignorance about sleep
is really quite profound.

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:13.644
Why is it? Why do we abandon
sleep in our thoughts?

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:17.571
Well, it's because you don't do anything
much while you're asleep, it seems.

00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.012
You don't eat. You don't drink.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:22.790
And you don't have sex.

00:03:22.814 --> 00:03:24.218
Well, most of us anyway.

00:03:24.242 --> 00:03:26.046
And so, therefore it's --

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.228
Sorry.

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:30.268
It's a complete waste of time, right?

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:31.665
Wrong.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.488
Actually, sleep is an incredibly
important part of our biology,

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:38.056
and neuroscientists
are beginning to explain

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.126
why it's so very important.

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:42.447
So let's move to the brain.

00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:46.774
Now, here we have a brain.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.961
This is donated by a social scientist,

00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:55.580
and they said they didn't know what
it was or indeed, how to use it, so --

00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:58.558
(Laughter)

00:03:58.582 --> 00:03:59.743
Sorry.

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:02.294
So I borrowed it.

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:04.006
I don't think they noticed. OK.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.594
(Laughter)

00:04:06.618 --> 00:04:09.791
The point I'm trying to make
is that when you're asleep,

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.559
this thing doesn't shut down.

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:14.265
In fact, some areas of the brain
are actually more active

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.656
during the sleep state
than during the wake state.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.845
The other thing that's really
important about sleep

00:04:19.869 --> 00:04:22.995
is that it doesn't arise from a single
structure within the brain,

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:25.176
but is to some extent a network property.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.632
If we flip the brain on its back --

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:30.644
I love this little bit
of spinal cord here --

00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:33.573
this bit here is the hypothalamus,

00:04:33.597 --> 00:04:37.411
and right under there is a whole raft
of interesting structures,

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:39.016
not least the biological clock.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.655
The biological clock tells us
when it's good to be up,

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:43.227
when it's good to be asleep,

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:45.179
and what that structure does is interact

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:48.421
with a whole raft of other areas
within the hypothalamus,

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:51.265
the lateral hypothalamus,
the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.653
All of those combine,

00:04:52.677 --> 00:04:55.864
and they send projections
down to the brain stem here.

00:04:55.888 --> 00:04:58.865
The brain stem then projects forward

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.934
and bathes the cortex,
this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.392
with neurotransmitters that keep us awake

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:08.030
and essentially provide us
with our consciousness.

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:10.770
So sleep arises from a whole raft

00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.873
of different interactions
within the brain,

00:05:12.897 --> 00:05:15.066
and essentially,
sleep is turned on and off

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.638
as a result of a range
of interactions in here.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.900
OK. So where have we got to?

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:23.450
We've said that sleep is complicated

00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:28.164
and it takes 32 years of our life.

00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:31.227
But what I haven't explained
is what sleep is about.

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.377
So why do we sleep?

00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.695
And it won't surprise
any of you that, of course,

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.687
as scientists, we don't have a consensus.

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.985
There are dozens of different ideas
about why we sleep,

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.993
and I'm going to outline three of those.

00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:46.216
The first is sort of the restoration idea,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.086
and it's somewhat intuitive.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.876
Essentially, all the stuff
we've burned up during the day,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.136
we restore, we replace,
we rebuild during the night.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.612
And indeed, as an explanation,
it goes back to Aristotle,

00:05:57.636 --> 00:05:59.813
so that's what -- 2,300 years ago.

00:05:59.837 --> 00:06:01.434
It's gone in and out of fashion.

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:02.903
It's fashionable at the moment

00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:05.320
because what's been shown
is that within the brain,

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:09.986
a whole raft of genes have been shown
to be turned on only during sleep,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.309
and those genes are associated
with restoration and metabolic pathways.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:17.864
So there's good evidence
for the whole restoration hypothesis.

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:20.404
What about energy conservation?

00:06:20.428 --> 00:06:23.223
Again, perhaps intuitive.

00:06:23.764 --> 00:06:26.051
You essentially sleep to save calories.

00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:29.934
Now, when you do the sums,
though, it doesn't really pan out.

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:34.278
If you compare an individual
who has slept at night,

00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:38.009
or stayed awake
and hasn't moved very much,

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:42.577
the energy saving of sleeping
is about 110 calories a night.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.216
Now, that's the equivalent
of a hot dog bun.

00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:49.494
Now, I would say that a hot dog bun

00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:51.311
is kind of a meager return

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:54.066
for such a complicated
and demanding behavior as sleep.

00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:57.683
So I'm less convinced
by the energy conservation idea.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.597
But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.076
which is brain processing
and memory consolidation.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.978
What we know is that,
if after you've tried to learn a task,

00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:09.812
and you sleep-deprive individuals,

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:12.377
the ability to learn that task is smashed.

00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:15.457
It's really hugely attenuated.

00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:18.521
So sleep and memory consolidation
is also very important.

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:21.046
However, it's not just
the laying down of memory

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.640
and recalling it.

00:07:22.664 --> 00:07:25.000
What's turned out to be really exciting

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:29.563
is that our ability to come up
with novel solutions to complex problems

00:07:29.587 --> 00:07:32.005
is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:35.432
In fact, it's been estimated
to give us a threefold advantage.

00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:38.099
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:40.979
And what seems to be going on
is that, in the brain,

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.556
those neural connections
that are important,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.757
those synaptic connections
that are important,

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:47.288
are linked and strengthened,

00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:51.640
while those that are less important
tend to fade away and be less important.

00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:53.369
OK.

00:07:53.393 --> 00:07:56.408
So we've had three explanations
for why we might sleep,

00:07:56.432 --> 00:08:00.086
and I think the important thing to realize
is that the details will vary,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.211
and it's probable we sleep
for multiple different reasons.

00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:06.361
But sleep is not an indulgence.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:11.016
It's not some sort of thing that we can
take on board rather casually.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.883
I think that sleep was once
likened to an upgrade

00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:17.931
from economy to business class,
you know, the equivalent of.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:21.352
It's not even an upgrade
from economy to first class.

00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:26.865
The critical thing to realize is that
if you don't sleep,

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:28.236
you don't fly.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.907
Essentially, you never get there.

00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:33.518
And what's extraordinary
about much of our society these days

00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:36.591
is that we are desperately sleep-deprived.

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.655
So let's now look at sleep deprivation.

00:08:39.298 --> 00:08:41.988
Huge sectors of society
are sleep-deprived,

00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:44.296
and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.

00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:48.101
So in the 1950s, good data
suggests that most of us

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:50.713
were getting around eight hours
of sleep a night.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.344
Nowadays, we sleep one and a half
to two hours less every night,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.843
so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours
every-night league.

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.620
For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.

00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:05.602
They need nine hours
for full brain performance,

00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:09.269
and many of them, on a school night,
are only getting five hours of sleep.

00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:10.921
It's simply not enough.

00:09:10.945 --> 00:09:13.989
If we think about other sectors
of society -- the aged;

00:09:14.013 --> 00:09:18.428
if you are aged, then your ability
to sleep in a single block

00:09:18.452 --> 00:09:21.016
is somewhat disrupted,
and many sleep, again,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.452
less than five hours a night.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:23.949
Shift work.

00:09:23.973 --> 00:09:25.504
Shift work is extraordinary,

00:09:25.528 --> 00:09:28.012
perhaps 20 percent
of the working population,

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:32.006
and the body clock does not shift
to the demands of working at night.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.200
It's locked onto the same
light-dark cycle as the rest of us.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:37.435
So when the poor old
shift worker is going home

00:09:37.459 --> 00:09:39.936
to try and sleep during the day,
desperately tired,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.076
the body clock is saying,
"Wake up. This is the time to be awake."

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.156
So the quality of sleep
that you get as a night shift worker

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.136
is usually very poor,
again in that sort of five-hour region.

00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:53.076
And then, of course, tens of millions
of people suffer from jet lag.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.468
So who here has jet lag?

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:58.341
Well, my goodness gracious.

00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:01.171
Well, thank you very much
indeed for not falling asleep,

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:03.869
because that's what your brain is craving.

00:10:03.893 --> 00:10:09.207
One of the things that the brain does
is indulge in micro-sleeps,

00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:10.976
this involuntary falling asleep,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.213
and you have essentially
no control over it.

00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.996
Now, micro-sleeps can be sort
of somewhat embarrassing,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.996
but they can also be deadly.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.675
It's been estimated
that 31 percent of drivers

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:25.981
will fall asleep at the wheel
at least once in their life,

00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:28.171
and in the US, the statistics
are pretty good:

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:33.392
100,000 accidents on the freeway
have been associated with tiredness,

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:36.580
loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --
a hundred thousand a year.

00:10:36.604 --> 00:10:37.762
It's extraordinary.

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.851
At another level of terror,

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:43.453
we dip into the tragic
accidents at Chernobyl

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.600
and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.553
which was so tragically lost.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:50.978
And in the investigations
that followed those disasters,

00:10:51.002 --> 00:10:53.996
poor judgment as a result
of extended shift work

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.302
and loss of vigilance and tiredness

00:10:56.326 --> 00:11:00.240
was attributed to a big chunk
of those disasters.

00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:04.487
When you're tired and you lack sleep,

00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:08.132
you have poor memory,
you have poor creativity,

00:11:08.156 --> 00:11:10.263
you have increased impulsiveness,

00:11:10.287 --> 00:11:12.890
and you have overall poor judgment.

00:11:12.914 --> 00:11:16.001
But my friends,
it's so much worse than that.

00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:18.072
(Laughter)

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.056
If you are a tired brain,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.016
the brain is craving things to wake it up.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.206
So drugs, stimulants.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.900
Caffeine represents
the stimulant of choice

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:30.504
across much of the Western world.

00:11:30.528 --> 00:11:32.551
Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:35.589
and if you're a really naughty
tired brain, nicotine.

00:11:35.613 --> 00:11:38.906
Of course, you're fueling the waking state
with these stimulants,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.366
and then, of course, it gets
to 11 o'clock at night,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.778
and the brain says to itself,

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:44.964
"Actually, I need
to be asleep fairly shortly.

00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:47.857
What do we do about that
when I'm feeling completely wired?"

00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.167
Well, of course,
you then resort to alcohol.

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:53.996
Now alcohol, short-term,
you know, once or twice,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.771
to use to mildly sedate you,
can be very useful.

00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:59.651
It can actually ease the sleep transition.

00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:04.923
But what you must be so aware of
is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.

00:12:04.947 --> 00:12:06.414
A biological mimic for sleep,

00:12:06.438 --> 00:12:07.645
it sedates you.

00:12:07.669 --> 00:12:11.034
So it actually harms
some of the neural processing

00:12:11.058 --> 00:12:13.986
that's going on during memory
consolidation and memory recall.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.174
So it's a short-term acute measure,

00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:17.356
but for goodness sake,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.390
don't become addicted to alcohol

00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:21.483
as a way of getting to sleep every night.

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:25.620
Another connection
between loss of sleep is weight gain.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:29.239
If you sleep around
about five hours or less every night,

00:12:29.263 --> 00:12:33.108
then you have a 50 percent
likelihood of being obese.

00:12:33.132 --> 00:12:34.855
What's the connection here?

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:39.243
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise
to the release of the hormone ghrelin,

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:40.424
the hunger hormone.

00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:41.600
Ghrelin is released.

00:12:41.624 --> 00:12:43.035
It gets to the brain.

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.842
The brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:49.469
and what it does is seek out carbohydrates
and particularly sugars.

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:52.184
So there's a link between tiredness

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:55.778
and the metabolic predisposition
for weight gain: stress.

00:12:55.802 --> 00:12:58.080
Tired people are massively stressed.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.159
And one of the things of stress,
of course, is loss of memory,

00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:06.026
which is what I sort of just then
had a little lapse of.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.121
But stress is so much more.

00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:12.295
So, if you're acutely stressed,
not a great problem,

00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:16.094
but it's sustained stress associated
with sleep loss that's the problem.

00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:20.195
Sustained stress leads
to suppressed immunity.

00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:23.782
And so, tired people tend to have
higher rates of overall infection,

00:13:23.806 --> 00:13:25.458
and there's some very good studies

00:13:25.482 --> 00:13:28.884
showing that shift workers, for example,
have higher rates of cancer.

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:32.732
Increased levels of stress
throw glucose into the circulation.

00:13:32.756 --> 00:13:36.774
Glucose becomes a dominant part
of the vasculature

00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:39.266
and essentially you become
glucose intolerant.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.213
Therefore, diabetes 2.

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:47.491
Stress increases cardiovascular disease
as a result of raising blood pressure.

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:50.808
So there's a whole raft of things
associated with sleep loss

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:54.455
that are more than just
a mildly impaired brain,

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:57.589
which is where I think most people think
that sleep loss resides.

00:13:57.613 --> 00:14:00.996
So at this point in the talk,
this is a nice time to think,

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.210
"Well, do you think on the whole
I'm getting enough sleep?"

00:14:04.234 --> 00:14:05.988
So a quick show of hands.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.598
Who feels that they're getting
enough sleep here?

00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:11.512
Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:14.615
Good. We'll talk more about that later,
about what are your tips.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.035
So most of us, of course,
ask the question,

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:19.366
"How do I know whether
I'm getting enough sleep?"

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.826
Well, it's not rocket science.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.912
If you need an alarm clock to get
you out of bed in the morning,

00:14:23.936 --> 00:14:25.973
if you are taking a long time to get up,

00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:27.528
if you need lots of stimulants,

00:14:27.552 --> 00:14:29.496
if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.318
if you're told by your work colleagues
that you're looking tired and irritable,

00:14:33.342 --> 00:14:35.667
chances are you are sleep-deprived.

00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:37.800
Listen to them. Listen to yourself.

00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:39.267
What do you do?

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:41.324
Well -- and this is slightly offensive --

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:42.505
sleep for dummies.

00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:44.649
(Laughter)

00:14:44.673 --> 00:14:47.458
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.

00:14:47.482 --> 00:14:50.986
The first critical thing is make it
as dark as you possibly can,

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.851
and also make it slightly cool.

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:54.027
Very important.

00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:56.957
Actually, reduce your amount
of light exposure

00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:59.330
at least half an hour
before you go to bed.

00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:02.107
Light increases levels of alertness
and will delay sleep.

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:04.994
What's the last thing that most of us
do before we go to bed?

00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:07.387
We stand in a massively lit bathroom,

00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:09.506
looking into the mirror
cleaning our teeth.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.085
It's the worst thing we can possibly do
before we go to sleep.

00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:15.812
Turn off those mobile phones.
Turn off those computers.

00:15:15.836 --> 00:15:19.552
Turn off all of those things
that are also going to excite the brain.

00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:22.819
Try not to drink caffeine
too late in the day,

00:15:22.843 --> 00:15:25.691
ideally not after lunch.

00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:29.016
Now, we've set about reducing light
exposure before you go to bed,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.972
but light exposure in the morning

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:34.287
is very good at setting the biological
clock to the light-dark cycle.

00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:35.970
So seek out morning light.

00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:38.450
Basically, listen to yourself.

00:15:38.474 --> 00:15:39.626
Wind down.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.812
Do those sorts of things

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:42.858
that you know are going to ease you off

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:45.560
into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.354
OK.

00:15:47.378 --> 00:15:49.680
That's some facts. What about some myths?

00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:50.986
Teenagers are lazy.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.874
No. Poor things.

00:15:52.898 --> 00:15:56.324
They have a biological predisposition
to go to bed late and get up late,

00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:57.637
so give them a break.

00:15:57.661 --> 00:16:00.541
We need eight hours of sleep a night.

00:16:01.392 --> 00:16:02.548
That's an average.

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:04.840
Some people need more.
Some people need less.

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:07.077
And what you need to do
is listen to your body.

00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:09.442
Do you need that much or do you need more?

00:16:09.466 --> 00:16:10.842
Simple as that.

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:12.986
Old people need less sleep.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.660
Not true.

00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:17.204
The sleep demands of the aged
do not go down.

00:16:17.584 --> 00:16:20.879
Essentially, sleep fragments
and becomes less robust,

00:16:20.903 --> 00:16:23.650
but sleep requirements do not go down.

00:16:23.674 --> 00:16:27.579
And the fourth myth
is early to bed, early to rise

00:16:27.603 --> 00:16:30.246
makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.026
Well, that's wrong
at so many different levels.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.381
(Laughter)

00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:39.920
There is no evidence that getting up early
and going to bed early

00:16:39.944 --> 00:16:41.364
gives you more wealth at all.

00:16:41.388 --> 00:16:43.996
There's no difference
in socioeconomic status.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.171
In my experience,

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:48.080
the only difference between morning
people and evening people

00:16:48.104 --> 00:16:50.605
is that those people that get up
in the morning early

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:51.921
are just horribly smug.

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.216
(Laughter)

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.543
(Applause)

00:16:56.567 --> 00:16:57.719
OK.

00:16:57.743 --> 00:16:59.269
So for the last few minutes,

00:16:59.293 --> 00:17:01.166
what I want to do is change gears

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.939
and talk about some really new,
breaking areas of neuroscience,

00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:07.847
which is the association
between mental health,

00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.165
mental illness and sleep disruption.

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:14.289
We've known for 130 years
that in severe mental illness,

00:17:14.313 --> 00:17:17.597
there is always, always sleep disruption,

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.079
but it's been largely ignored.

00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:21.927
In the 1970s, when people started
to think about this again,

00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:25.757
they said, "Yes, well, of course you have
sleep disruption in schizophrenia,

00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:27.828
because they're on antipsychotics.

00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:30.864
It's the antipsychotics causing
the sleep problems,"

00:17:30.888 --> 00:17:33.817
ignoring the fact that
for a hundred years previously,

00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:37.822
sleep disruption had been reported
before antipsychotics.

00:17:37.846 --> 00:17:39.646
So what's going on?

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.674
Several groups are studying

00:17:42.698 --> 00:17:45.996
conditions like depression,
schizophrenia and bipolar

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.389
and what's going on
in terms of sleep disruption.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.484
We have a big study which we published
last year on schizophrenia,

00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:55.957
and the data were quite extraordinary.

00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:58.933
In those individuals with schizophrenia,

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:02.850
much of the time, they were awake
during the night phase

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.064
and then they were asleep during the day.

00:18:05.088 --> 00:18:07.627
Other groups showed no 24-hour
patterns whatsoever --

00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:09.596
their sleep was absolutely smashed.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.784
And some had no ability to regulate
their sleep by the light-dark cycle.

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:17.050
They were getting up later and later
and later and later each night.

00:18:17.074 --> 00:18:18.347
It was smashed.

00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:20.558
So what's going on?

00:18:20.582 --> 00:18:22.106
And the really exciting news

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:27.709
is that mental illness and sleep
are not simply associated,

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:30.447
but they are physically linked
within the brain.

00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:33.405
The neural networks that predispose
you to normal sleep,

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:34.690
give you normal sleep,

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:37.844
and those that give you normal
mental health, are overlapping.

00:18:38.344 --> 00:18:40.003
And what's the evidence for that?

00:18:40.027 --> 00:18:42.940
Well, genes that have been shown

00:18:42.964 --> 00:18:45.894
to be very important
in the generation of normal sleep,

00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:47.661
when mutated, when changed,

00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:51.017
also predispose individuals
to mental health problems.

00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:53.002
And last year, we published a study

00:18:53.026 --> 00:18:56.389
which showed that a gene
that's been linked to schizophrenia,

00:18:56.413 --> 00:18:59.769
when mutated, also smashes the sleep.

00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:03.116
So we have evidence
of a genuine mechanistic overlap

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.275
between these two important systems.

00:19:05.806 --> 00:19:07.806
Other work flowed from these studies.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.006
The first was that sleep disruption

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.908
actually precedes certain types
of mental illness,

00:19:14.932 --> 00:19:17.344
and we've shown that
in those young individuals

00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:20.753
who are at high risk
of developing bipolar disorder,

00:19:20.777 --> 00:19:23.270
they already have a sleep abnormality

00:19:23.294 --> 00:19:26.788
prior to any clinical
diagnosis of bipolar.

00:19:27.463 --> 00:19:33.188
The other bit of data
was that sleep disruption

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:37.354
may actually exacerbate, make worse,
the mental illness state.

00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:40.016
My colleague Dan Freeman
has used a range of agents

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.584
which have stabilized sleep
and reduced levels of paranoia

00:19:43.608 --> 00:19:45.856
in those individuals by 50 percent.

00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:47.784
So what have we got?

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:53.070
We've got, in these connections,
some really exciting things.

00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:55.123
In terms of the neuroscience,

00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:56.893
by understanding these two systems,

00:19:56.917 --> 00:20:00.217
we're really beginning to understand
how both sleep and mental illness

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.104
are generated and regulated
within the brain.

00:20:03.128 --> 00:20:06.819
The second area
is that if we can use sleep

00:20:06.843 --> 00:20:09.327
and sleep disruption
as an early warning signal,

00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:11.597
then we have the chance of going in.

00:20:11.621 --> 00:20:14.026
If we know these individuals
are vulnerable,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.569
early intervention then becomes possible.

00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:19.164
And the third, which I think
is the most exciting,

00:20:19.188 --> 00:20:21.966
is that we can think
of the sleep centers within the brain

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.346
as a new therapeutic target.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.260
Stabilize sleep in those individuals
who are vulnerable,

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.271
we can certainly make them healthier,

00:20:28.295 --> 00:20:32.986
but also alleviate some of the appalling
symptoms of mental illness.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.372
So let me just finish.

00:20:34.396 --> 00:20:37.663
What I started by saying is:
Take sleep seriously.

00:20:37.687 --> 00:20:40.136
Our attitudes toward sleep
are so very different

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.685
from a pre-industrial age,

00:20:41.709 --> 00:20:43.812
when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.

00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:47.275
We used to understand intuitively
the importance of sleep.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:50.854
And this isn't some sort
of crystal-waving nonsense.

00:20:50.878 --> 00:20:53.498
This is a pragmatic response
to good health.

00:20:53.522 --> 00:20:56.339
If you have good sleep,
it increases your concentration,

00:20:56.363 --> 00:21:00.348
attention, decision-making,
creativity, social skills, health.

00:21:00.372 --> 00:21:04.697
If you get sleep, it reduces
your mood changes, your stress,

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.854
your levels of anger, your impulsivity,

00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:09.471
and your tendency to drink and take drugs.

00:21:09.495 --> 00:21:12.330
And we finished by saying

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:15.480
that an understanding
of the neuroscience of sleep

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:18.308
is really informing the way we think

00:21:18.332 --> 00:21:20.842
about some of the causes
of mental illness,

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.922
and indeed is providing us new ways

00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:26.405
to treat these incredibly
debilitating conditions.

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:31.476
Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.521
"Sleep is God. Go worship."

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:35.752
And I can only recommend
that you do the same.

00:21:35.776 --> 00:21:37.204
Thank you for your attention.

00:21:37.228 --> 00:21:40.992
