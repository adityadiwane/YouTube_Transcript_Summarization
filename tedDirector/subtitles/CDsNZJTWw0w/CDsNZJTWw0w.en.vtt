00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:15.958
Looking deeply inside nature,

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.071
through the magnifying glass of science,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.676
designers extract principles,
processes and materials

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.815
that are forming the very basis
of design methodology.

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:32.328
From synthetic constructs
that resemble biological materials,

00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:35.719
to computational methods
that emulate neural processes,

00:00:35.743 --> 00:00:38.208
nature is driving design.

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:41.200
Design is also driving nature.

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:45.863
In realms of genetics, regenerative
medicine and synthetic biology,

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:48.592
designers are growing novel technologies,

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.693
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.083
Bionics explores the interplay
between biology and design.

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:02.002
As you can see, my legs are bionic.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.514
Today, I will tell human stories
of bionic integration;

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:14.237
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:18.975
are beginning to bridge the gap
between disability and ability,

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.808
between human limitation
and human potential.

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.363
Bionics has defined my physicality.

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:30.680
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:32.808
due to tissue damage from frostbite,

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.084
incurred during
a mountain-climbing accident.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.537
At that time, I didn't
view my body as broken.

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:44.758
I reasoned that a human being
can never be "broken."

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:47.584
Technology is broken.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.742
Technology is inadequate.

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:56.096
This simple but powerful idea
was a call to arms,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.627
to advance technology
for the elimination of my own disability,

00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.143
and ultimately, the disability of others.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.418
I began by developing specialized limbs

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:09.903
that allowed me to return
to the vertical world

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:11.394
of rock and ice climbing.

00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:16.036
I quickly realized that the artificial
part of my body is malleable;

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.410
able to take on any form, any function --

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:23.373
a blank slate for which to create,

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:28.565
perhaps, structures that could extend
beyond biological capability.

00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.741
I made my height adjustable.

00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:33.445
I could be as short as five feet
or as tall as I'd like.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.898
(Laughter)

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:39.272
So when I was feeling bad about myself,

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:41.133
insecure, I would jack my height up.

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:43.038
(Laughter)

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.259
But when I was feeling
confident and suave,

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:49.052
I would knock my height down a notch,
just to give the competition a chance.

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:51.171
(Laughter)

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:53.298
(Applause)

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:56.591
Narrow-edged feet allowed me
to climb steep rock fissures,

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:59.217
where the human foot cannot penetrate,

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:03.423
and spiked feet enabled me
to climb vertical ice walls,

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:06.320
without ever experiencing
muscle leg fatigue.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.589
Through technological innovation,

00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:12.454
I returned to my sport,
stronger and better.

00:03:12.478 --> 00:03:15.061
Technology had eliminated my disability,

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:17.427
and allowed me a new climbing prowess.

00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:21.014
As a young man, I imagined a future world
where technology so advanced

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:22.820
could rid the world of disability,

00:03:22.844 --> 00:03:24.940
a world in which neural
implants would allow

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:26.613
the visually impaired to see.

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:31.359
A world in which the paralyzed
could walk, via body exoskeletons.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.423
Sadly, because of
deficiencies in technology,

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.181
disability is rampant in the world.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.213
This gentleman is missing three limbs.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:43.726
As a testimony to current technology,
he is out of the wheelchair,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.671
but we need to do a better job in bionics,
to allow, one day, full rehabilitation

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:52.900
for a person with this level of injury.

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:57.455
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
the Center for Extreme Bionics.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.027
The mission of the center
is to put forth fundamental science

00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.887
and technological capability

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.658
that will allow the biomechatronic
and regenerative repair of humans,

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:12.603
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:17.444
Today, I'm going to tell you
how my legs function, how they work,

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:20.746
as a case in point for this center.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.897
Now, I made sure to shave
my legs last night,

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:24.868
because I knew I'd be showing them off.

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.341
(Laughter)

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:29.595
Bionics entails the engineering
of extreme interfaces.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.491
There's three extreme
interfaces in my bionic limbs:

00:04:32.515 --> 00:04:36.595
mechanical, how my limbs
are attached to my biological body;

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.918
dynamic, how they move
like flesh and bone;

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:42.832
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:45.102
I'll begin with mechanical interface.

00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:49.047
In the area of design,
we still do not understand

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.947
how to attach devices
to the body mechanically.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:56.328
It's extraordinary to me
that in this day and age,

00:04:56.352 --> 00:04:58.677
one of the most mature,
oldest technologies

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:03.097
in the human timeline, the shoe,
still gives us blisters.

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.578
How can this be?

00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:07.554
We have no idea how to attach
things to our bodies.

00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:11.269
This is the beautifully
lyrical design work

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:13.714
of Professor Neri Oxman
at the MIT Media Lab,

00:05:13.738 --> 00:05:17.162
showing spatially varying
exoskeletal impedances,

00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:21.200
shown here by color variation
in this 3D-printed model.

00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:26.335
Imagine a future where clothing
is stiff and soft where you need it,

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.889
when you need it, for optimal
support and flexibility,

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.588
without ever causing discomfort.

00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:35.534
My bionic limbs are attached
to my biological body

00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:39.620
via synthetic skins
with stiffness variations,

00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:43.264
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:47.533
To achieve that mirroring, we first
developed a mathematical model

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.105
of my biological limb.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.411
To that end, we used
imaging tools such as MRI,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.999
to look inside my body,

00:05:54.023 --> 00:05:57.728
to figure out the geometries
and locations of various tissues.

00:05:57.752 --> 00:05:59.139
We also took robotic tools --

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:04.074
here's a 14-actuator circle
that goes around the biological limb.

00:06:04.891 --> 00:06:07.439
The actuators come in,
find the surface of the limb,

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:09.708
measure its unloaded shape,

00:06:09.732 --> 00:06:11.383
and then they push on the tissues

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:14.978
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.789
We combine these imaging and robotic data

00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:21.455
to build a mathematical description
of my biological limb, shown on the left.

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.233
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.407
At each node, there's a color
that represents tissue compliance.

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:30.373
We then do a mathematical transformation
to the design of the synthetic skin,

00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:31.596
shown on the right.

00:06:32.088 --> 00:06:34.492
And we've discovered optimality is:

00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:37.373
where the body is stiff,
the synthetic skin should be soft,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.857
where the body is soft,
the synthetic skin is stiff,

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:44.164
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.481
With this framework,
we've produced bionic limbs

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.426
that are the most comfortable
limbs I've ever worn.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:57.166
Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.846
will no longer be designed
and manufactured using artisan strategies,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.074
but rather, data-driven
quantitative frameworks.

00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:08.302
In that future, our shoes
will no longer give us blisters.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.937
We're also embedding
sensing and smart materials

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:13.532
into the synthetic skins.

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:18.024
This is a material developed
by SRI International, California.

00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:21.036
Under electrostatic effect,
it changes stiffness.

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:24.674
So under zero voltage,
the material is compliant,

00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:26.072
it's floppy like paper.

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.564
Then the button's pushed,
a voltage is applied,

00:07:28.588 --> 00:07:30.580
and it becomes stiff as a board.

00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:32.722
(Tapping sounds)

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:36.314
We embed this material
into the synthetic skin

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:39.447
that attaches my bionic limb
to my biological body.

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.318
When I walk here, it's no voltage.

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:44.399
My interface is soft and compliant.

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:47.414
The button's pushed,
voltage is applied, and it stiffens,

00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:50.454
offering me a greater maneuverability
over the bionic limb.

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.751
We're also building exoskeletons.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:55.583
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:58.545
in just the right areas
of the running cycle,

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.823
to protect the biological joints
from high impacts and degradation.

00:08:02.847 --> 00:08:05.633
In the future, we'll all
be wearing exoskeletons

00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:07.942
in common activities, such as running.

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.450
Next, dynamic interface.

00:08:10.474 --> 00:08:12.982
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:17.784
At my MIT lab, we study how humans
with normal physiologies

00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:19.314
stand, walk and run.

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:20.729
What are the muscles doing,

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.126
and how are they controlled
by the spinal cord?

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:26.142
This basic science
motivates what we build.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:28.504
We're building bionic ankles,
knees and hips.

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:31.044
We're building body parts
from the ground up.

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:35.017
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
are called BiOMs.

00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:38.995
They've been fitted
to nearly 1,000 patients,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.981
400 of which have been
wounded U.S. soldiers.

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:43.163
How does it work?

00:08:43.187 --> 00:08:45.202
At heel strike, under computer control,

00:08:45.226 --> 00:08:47.202
the system controls stiffness,

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:50.263
to attenuate the shock
of the limb hitting the ground.

00:08:50.287 --> 00:08:54.383
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
outputs high torques and powers

00:08:54.407 --> 00:08:56.762
to lift the person
into the walking stride,

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.271
comparable to how muscles
work in the calf region.

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:04.826
This bionic propulsion is very important
clinically to patients.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.904
So on the left, you see
the bionic device worn by a lady,

00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:10.863
on the right, a passive device
worn by the same lady,

00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:13.713
that fails to emulate
normal muscle function,

00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:17.415
enabling her to do something
everyone should be able to do:

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:19.214
go up and down their steps at home.

00:09:19.634 --> 00:09:22.649
Bionics also allows
for extraordinary athletic feats.

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:25.792
Here's a gentleman running
up a rocky pathway.

00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:30.609
This is Steve Martin --
not the comedian --

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:33.612
who lost his legs in a bomb blast
in Afghanistan.

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:39.194
We're also building exoskeletal
structures using these same principles,

00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:41.461
that wrap around the biological limb.

00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:47.522
This gentleman does not have
any leg condition, any disability.

00:09:47.922 --> 00:09:49.802
He has a normal physiology,

00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:54.395
so these exoskeletons are applying
muscle-like torques and powers,

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:58.119
so that his own muscles need not
apply those torques and powers.

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:04.477
This is the first exoskeleton in history
that actually augments human walking.

00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.306
It significantly reduces metabolic cost.

00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:10.382
It's so profound in its augmentation,

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:13.555
that when a normal, healthy person
wears the device for 40 minutes

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.278
and then takes it off,

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:19.357
their own biological legs feel
ridiculously heavy and awkward.

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.450
We're beginning the age in which
machines attached to our bodies

00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:26.484
will make us stronger
and faster and more efficient.

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:29.446
Moving on to electrical interface:

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.627
How do my bionic limbs communicate
with my nervous system?

00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:34.493
Across my residual limb are electrodes

00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:37.262
that measure the electrical
pulse of my muscles.

00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:39.205
That's communicated to the bionic limb,

00:10:39.229 --> 00:10:42.282
so when I think about moving
my phantom limb,

00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:45.020
the robot tracks those movement desires.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.262
This diagram shows fundamentally
how the bionic limb is controlled.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.075
So we model the missing biological limb,

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:55.913
and we've discovered
what reflexes occurred,

00:10:55.937 --> 00:10:59.278
how the reflexes of the spinal cord
are controlling the muscles.

00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:04.199
And that capability is embedded
in the chips of the bionic limb.

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:08.969
What we've done, then, is we modulate
the sensitivity of the reflex,

00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:12.088
the modeled spinal reflex,
with the neural signal,

00:11:12.112 --> 00:11:15.541
so when I relax my muscles
in my residual limb,

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:18.412
I get very little torque and power,

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:21.157
but the more I fire my muscles,
the more torque I get,

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.593
and I can even run.

00:11:24.014 --> 00:11:28.958
And that was the first demonstration
of a running gait under neural command.

00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:30.134
Feels great.

00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:35.324
(Applause)

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:37.534
We want to go a step further.

00:11:37.558 --> 00:11:40.605
We want to actually close the loop

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:43.865
between the human
and the bionic external limb.

00:11:44.407 --> 00:11:45.558
We're doing experiments

00:11:45.582 --> 00:11:48.051
where we're growing nerves,
transected nerves,

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.105
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:51.823
On the other side of the channel,

00:11:51.847 --> 00:11:54.176
the nerve then attaches to cells,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.108
skin cells and muscle cells.

00:11:56.926 --> 00:12:01.046
In the motor channels, we can sense
how the person wishes to move.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.707
That can be sent out wirelessly
to the bionic limb,

00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:07.112
then [sensory information]
on the bionic limb

00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:10.637
can be converted to stimulations
in adjacent channels,

00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:11.894
sensory channels.

00:12:11.918 --> 00:12:15.946
So when this is fully developed
and for human use,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.606
persons like myself will not only have

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.163
synthetic limbs that move
like flesh and bone,

00:12:22.187 --> 00:12:24.949
but actually feel like flesh and bone.

00:12:26.187 --> 00:12:28.177
This video shows Lisa Mallette,

00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.852
shortly after being fitted
with two bionic limbs.

00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:34.964
Indeed, bionics is making
a profound difference in people's lives.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:36.741
(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.654
LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:44.121
(Video) (Laughter)

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:47.094
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.831
Woman: Now, don't start running.

00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:53.649
Man: Now turn around,
and do the same thing walking up,

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:57.402
but get on your heel to toe, like you
would normally just walk on level ground.

00:12:57.426 --> 00:12:59.252
Try to walk right up the hill.

00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:03.514
LM: Oh my God.

00:13:04.037 --> 00:13:05.283
Man: Is it pushing you up?

00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:10.262
LM: Yes! I'm not even --
I can't even describe it.

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:11.799
Man: It's pushing you right up.

00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:15.156
Hugh Herr: Next week,
I'm visiting the Center --

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.332
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:19.862
(Applause)

00:13:19.886 --> 00:13:21.169
Thank you.

00:13:21.193 --> 00:13:25.018
Next week I'm visiting the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:27.645
and I'm going to try to convince CMS

00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:30.224
to grant appropriate
code language and pricing,

00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:33.979
so this technology can be made available
to the patients that need it.

00:13:34.003 --> 00:13:35.026
(Applause)

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.210
Thank you.

00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:39.849
(Applause)

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:43.817
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population

00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:48.608
suffers from some form of cognitive,
emotional, sensory or motor condition,

00:13:48.632 --> 00:13:53.042
and because of poor technology,
too often, conditions result in disability

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.701
and a poorer quality of life.

00:13:55.113 --> 00:14:00.053
Basic levels of physiological function
should be a part of our human rights.

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:04.033
Every person should have the right
to live life without disability

00:14:04.057 --> 00:14:05.954
if they so choose --

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.700
the right to live life
without severe depression;

00:14:08.724 --> 00:14:12.105
the right to see a loved one,
in the case of seeing-impaired;

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.018
or the right to walk or to dance,

00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:16.799
in the case of limb paralysis
or limb amputation.

00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:21.299
As a society, we can
achieve these human rights,

00:14:21.323 --> 00:14:26.817
if we accept the proposition
that humans are not disabled.

00:14:27.794 --> 00:14:29.714
A person can never be broken.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.175
Our built environment, our technologies,

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:35.074
are broken and disabled.

00:14:35.444 --> 00:14:38.476
We the people need not
accept our limitations,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.197
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.

00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:46.559
Indeed, through fundamental advances
in bionics in this century,

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:50.741
we will set the technological foundation
for an enhanced human experience,

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.702
and we will end disability.

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:57.011
I'd like to finish up
with one more story, a beautiful story.

00:14:57.613 --> 00:14:59.630
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.198
Adrianne lost her left leg
in the Boston terrorist attack.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:08.721
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:11.221
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.858
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:16.636
It is her expression. It is her art form.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.659
Naturally, when she lost her limb
in the Boston terrorist attack,

00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:22.850
she wanted to return to the dance floor.

00:15:23.828 --> 00:15:25.987
After meeting her
and driving home in my car,

00:15:26.011 --> 00:15:29.864
I thought, I'm an MIT professor.
I have resources.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.426
Let's build her a bionic limb,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.380
to enable her to go back
to her life of dance.

00:15:35.396 --> 00:15:38.872
I brought in MIT scientists
with expertise in prosthetics,

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.205
robotics, machine learning
and biomechanics,

00:15:41.229 --> 00:15:45.064
and over a 200-day research period,
we studied dance.

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:49.286
We brought in dancers
with biological limbs,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.945
and we studied how they move,

00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:55.142
what forces they apply on the dance floor,

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:56.693
and we took those data,

00:15:56.717 --> 00:16:00.492
and we put forth
fundamental principles of dance,

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:02.303
reflexive dance capability,

00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:05.492
and we embedded that intelligence
into the bionic limb.

00:16:05.992 --> 00:16:09.737
Bionics is not only about making
people stronger and faster.

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:15.173
Our expression, our humanity
can be embedded into electromechanics.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.296
It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts
in the Boston terrorist attack.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:27.296
In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards
took Adrianne off the dance floor.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.026
In 200 days, we put her back.

00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:35.468
We will not be intimidated, brought down,
diminished, conquered or stopped

00:16:35.492 --> 00:16:37.037
by acts of violence.

00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:43.997
(Applause)

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:49.348
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me
to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,

00:16:49.372 --> 00:16:51.602
her first performance since the attack.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.517
She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

00:16:54.541 --> 00:17:01.233
(Applause)

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:11.694
(Music: "Ring My Bell"
performed by Enrique Iglesias)

00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:58.037
(Applause)

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.938
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the research team:

00:18:24.962 --> 00:18:26.957
Elliott Rouse

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.377
and Nathan Villagaray-Carski.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.163
Elliott and Nathan.

00:18:32.187 --> 00:18:38.772
(Applause)
