00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:40.898
(Music)

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:41.254
(Applause)

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:46.614
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.287
Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here.

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:52.211
A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.491
of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.650
at the early stages of her recovery

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.835
from one of those awful bullets.

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.956
This one entered her left hemisphere, and

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:04.472
knocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain.

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:08.378
And in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist,

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:10.167
and she's struggling to produce

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.279
some of the most basic words, and you can see her

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.458
growing more and more devastated, until she ultimately

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.334
breaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:23.310
wordlessly into the arms of her therapist.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.627
And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack,

00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:27.262
and they start singing together,

00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:29.403
and Gabby starts to sing through her tears,

00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:32.066
and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.527
the words to a song that describe the way she feels,

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:37.447
and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings,

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:41.056
"Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:44.037
And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:47.601
the beauty of music has the ability to speak

00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:52.377
where words fail, in this case literally speak.

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:54.130
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.931
of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug,

00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:00.682
one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard,

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:03.101
and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:08.114
Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:12.437
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic,

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:17.087
could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences,

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:20.390
but they could still sing the lyrics to a song,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.339
whether it was "Happy Birthday To You"

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:24.977
or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.

00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:27.916
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons,

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:31.918
he found that the music was able to literally rewire

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.370
the brains of his patients and create a homologous

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.262
speech center in their right hemisphere

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:39.761
to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:43.146
When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.662
he walked me through some of the leading research

00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:49.497
on music and the brain -- how musicians had

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.561
fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians,

00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:54.071
how music, and listening to music,

00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.325
could just light up the entire brain, from

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:59.799
our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.626
how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:06.249
to help children with autism, to help people struggling

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.034
with stress and anxiety and depression,

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:12.449
how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.830
and their gait would steady when they listened to music,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.239
and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:22.135
was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize

00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:24.921
their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin

00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:28.583
at the piano that they had learned when they were children.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:31.630
But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.848
and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life,

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:37.633
trying to choose between music and medicine.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:40.594
I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working

00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:43.467
as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe,

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.930
studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.797
in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:53.575
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes,

00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:57.692
these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia

00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.523
and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:04.312
tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:07.236
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor,

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:09.240
that doctor without borders.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.783
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.

00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:16.525
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.

00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:19.688
It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:22.767
at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:27.122
my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv,

00:06:27.122 --> 00:06:29.160
and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.384
had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory,

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:34.767
but had given up his love for music to pursue a career

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:38.448
in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.984
"How was it for you making that decision?"

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.013
And he said that there were still times when he wished

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:45.785
he could go back and play the organ the way he used to,

00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:49.002
and that for me, medical school could wait,

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:51.777
but that the violin simply would not.

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:54.337
And after two more years of studying music, I decided

00:06:54.337 --> 00:06:57.146
to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:59.722
and applying to medical school like a good Indian son

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:02.580
to become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter)

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.212
And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:08.155
an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.

00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:11.157
It was my first audition, and after three days of playing

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:14.183
behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:18.101
And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.601
in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall

00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:25.185
in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel,

00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:28.171
but much more importantly to me to be surrounded

00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:32.061
by musicians and mentors that became my new family,

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.255
my new musical home.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.965
But a year later, I met another musician who had also

00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:42.054
studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me

00:07:42.054 --> 00:07:46.412
find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician.

00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:49.693
Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but

00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:53.432
he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s,

00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:55.778
was treated with thorazine at Bellevue,

00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:59.254
and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.700
in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.145
Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:08.003
and mental health advocacy throughout the United States,

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:10.148
as told through the book and the movie "The Soloist,"

00:08:10.148 --> 00:08:13.294
but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher,

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:15.804
and I told him that wherever he had his violin,

00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:18.775
and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:21.454
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row,

00:08:21.454 --> 00:08:24.263
I witnessed how music was able to bring him back

00:08:24.263 --> 00:08:27.230
from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.190
in my untrained eye to be

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.990
the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.244
Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning,

00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:38.802
because now it was about communication,

00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:41.712
a communication where words failed, a communication

00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.870
of a message that went deeper than words, that registered

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.359
at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche,

00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:52.906
yet came as a true musical offering from me.

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:56.883
I found myself growing outraged that someone

00:08:56.883 --> 00:09:00.792
like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row

00:09:00.792 --> 00:09:04.131
because of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands

00:09:04.131 --> 00:09:07.236
of others there were out there on Skid Row alone

00:09:07.236 --> 00:09:11.992
who had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie

00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:14.254
made about them that got them off the streets?

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:18.267
And at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:22.362
the life of music had chosen me, where somehow,

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:25.331
perhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:28.342
really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:32.483
and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.

00:09:32.483 --> 00:09:34.533
But in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:37.260
that if I was truly passionate about change,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.583
if I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it,

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:46.352
that music was the bridge that connected my world and his.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.024
There's a beautiful quote

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.488
by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann,

00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:55.697
who said, "To send light into the darkness of men's hearts,

00:09:55.697 --> 00:09:58.122
such is the duty of the artist."

00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:00.558
And this is a particularly poignant quote

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:03.297
because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia

00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:05.405
and died in asylum.

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.867
And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel,

00:10:07.867 --> 00:10:10.231
I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians

00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.424
called Street Symphony, bringing the light of music

00:10:13.424 --> 00:10:16.068
into the very darkest places, performing

00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:18.655
for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics

00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:22.685
on Skid Row, performing for combat veterans

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:26.095
with post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated

00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:29.899
and those labeled as criminally insane.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:32.292
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:34.813
in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us

00:10:34.813 --> 00:10:37.130
and she had tears streaming down her face,

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.596
and she had a palsy, she was shaking,

00:10:39.596 --> 00:10:42.618
and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:44.600
that she had never heard classical music before,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.026
she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:51.128
heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine,

00:10:51.128 --> 00:10:54.497
and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years,

00:10:54.497 --> 00:10:59.300
when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.258
Suddenly, what we're finding with these concerts,

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:05.300
away from the stage, away from the footlights, out

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.921
of the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit

00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:12.043
for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:15.136
of music on the brain to an audience that would never

00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:16.938
have access to this room,

00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:22.770
would never have access to the kind of music that we make.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.201
Just as medicine serves to heal more

00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:29.499
than the building blocks of the body alone,

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:33.266
the power and beauty of music transcends the "E"

00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:36.001
in the middle of our beloved acronym.

00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:39.639
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:42.649
The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:45.906
hear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms,

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:49.552
or chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember

00:11:49.552 --> 00:11:53.460
our shared, common humanity, the deeply communal

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.875
connected consciousness, the empathic consciousness

00:11:56.875 --> 00:12:00.448
that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired

00:12:00.448 --> 00:12:03.524
into our brain's right hemisphere.

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:06.920
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.081
of mental illness within homelessness

00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:11.864
and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:16.496
offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them,

00:12:16.496 --> 00:12:19.878
to remember that they still have the capacity to experience

00:12:19.878 --> 00:12:23.830
something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.691
And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:29.491
transforms into hope,

00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:32.451
and we know, whether we choose the path of music

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:35.660
or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.599
within our communities, within our audiences,

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:41.530
if we want to inspire healing from within.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.206
I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats,

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:46.251
the Romantic English poet,

00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.189
a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.

00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:52.208
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:55.529
to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.

00:12:55.529 --> 00:13:00.602
And Keats said, "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty.

00:13:00.602 --> 00:13:07.100
That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."

00:13:09.857 --> 00:15:53.980
(Music)

00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:22.456
(Applause)
