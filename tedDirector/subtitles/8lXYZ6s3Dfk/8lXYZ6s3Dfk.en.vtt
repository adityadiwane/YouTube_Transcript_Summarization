00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:19.657
When I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California,

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:21.906
and I lived in a little town called Elk

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:23.893
on the Mendocino coast,

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:28.451
and I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail,

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.186
and life was good back then, if you could remember it.

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:34.908
I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:37.594
and a brownie, and I'd ship my film

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.329
to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later,

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.125
it would end up on my front door,

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.155
which was way better than having to fight the traffic

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.069
of Hollywood. (Music)

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.057
I didn't have much money,

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:55.984
but I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music)

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.872
So I started shooting time-lapse photography.

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:01.637
It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:06.219
roll of film, because that's all I could afford.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.693
I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously,

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.730
non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.513
for over 30 years, and to see them move

00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:18.559
is a dance I'll never get tired of.

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:23.458
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.641
It also provides a third of the food we eat.

00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.104
(Music)

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:33.249
Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival,

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.360
because we protect what we fall in love with.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.285
It opens our hearts, and makes us realize

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:43.270
we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.354
When we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:49.578
to every one of us, because it's clear

00:01:49.578 --> 00:01:52.633
that it's all connected in one.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.017
When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,

00:01:56.017 --> 00:02:00.297
"Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant?

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:02.858
The "oh" means it caught your attention,

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:06.025
makes you present, makes you mindful.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.609
The "my" means it connects with something deep

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.881
inside your soul.

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.625
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.617
and be heard. And "God"?

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:20.225
God is that personal journey we all want to be on,

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:24.900
to be inspired, to feel like we're connected to a universe

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.020
that celebrates life.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.710
Did you know that 80 percent

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.521
of the information we receive comes through our eyes?

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.623
And if you compare light energy to musical scales,

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:40.649
it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.209
which is right in the middle?

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.033
And aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know,

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.081
take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:54.401
to create images in order for us to explore our world?

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:55.956
And aren't we grateful that we have hearts

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:58.202
that can feel these vibrations

00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:01.794
in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure

00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:04.571
and the beauty of nature?

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.794
(Music)

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.864
Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates

00:03:11.864 --> 00:03:14.222
appreciation and gratitude.

00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:17.982
(Music)

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.665
So I have a gift I want to share with you today,

00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:24.046
a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed,

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:27.094
and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:30.691
from the point of view of a child and an elderly man

00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:32.610
of that world.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:40.308
Child: When I watch TV,

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:45.752
it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend,

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:48.510
and when you explore, you get

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.118
more imagination than you already had,

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.374
and when you get more imagination,

00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:58.741
it makes you want to go deeper in

00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:01.832
so you can get more and see beautifuller things,

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:08.410
like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.909
or something, and it could be beautiful.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:39.845
(Music)

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:46.827
Elderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life?

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:53.357
It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you

00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:57.103
today.

00:04:57.103 --> 00:05:03.007
It's given to you. It's a gift.

00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:07.357
It's the only gift that you have right now,

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:10.261
and the only appropriate response

00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:17.267
is gratefulness.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:27.348
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:31.964
to the great gift that this unique day is,

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.781
if you learn to respond

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:38.773
as if it were the first day in your life

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:41.457
and the very last day,

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:49.901
then you will have spent this day very well.

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.730
Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.557
that you have eyes you can open,

00:05:57.557 --> 00:06:02.836
that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us

00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:06.518
for pure enjoyment.

00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:09.966
Look at the sky.

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:13.426
We so rarely look at the sky.

00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:18.597
We so rarely note how different it is

00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:23.693
from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:26.419
We just think of the weather,

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.559
and even with the weather, we don't think of

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:31.782
all the many nuances of weather.

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:35.907
We just think of good weather and bad weather.

00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:40.619
This day, right now, has unique weather,

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:43.687
maybe a kind that will never exactly

00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:46.475
in that form come again.

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:50.451
That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.665
as it is right now.

00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:58.930
Open your eyes. Look at that.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.575
Look at the faces of people whom you meet.

00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:10.998
Each one has an incredible story behind their face,

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:17.374
a story that you could never fully fathom,

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:24.711
not only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.855
We all go back so far,

00:07:27.855 --> 00:07:32.085
and in this present moment, on this day,

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:37.249
all the people you meet, all that life from generations

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:41.415
and from so many places all over the world

00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:44.767
flows together and meets you here

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:51.000
like a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.847
(Music)

00:07:57.847 --> 00:08:03.214
Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization

00:08:03.214 --> 00:08:05.133
gives to us.

00:08:05.133 --> 00:08:09.211
You flip a switch and there is electric light.

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:15.019
You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water,

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.170
and drinkable water.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.681
It's a gift that millions and millions in the world

00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.097
will never experience.

00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:29.820
So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.352
to which we can open your heart.

00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:37.150
And so I wish you that you will open your heart

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.530
to all these blessings, and let them flow through you,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.521
that everyone whom you will meet on this day

00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.543
will be blessed by you,

00:08:50.543 --> 00:08:54.020
just by your eyes,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.446
by your smile,

00:08:57.446 --> 00:09:00.882
by your touch,

00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:05.230
just by your presence.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.083
Let the gratefulness overflow

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:15.349
into blessing all around you,

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:24.601
and then it will really be a good day. (Music)

00:09:30.813 --> 00:09:31.712
(Applause)

00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:34.653
Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.

00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:40.856
Thank you very much. (Applause)
