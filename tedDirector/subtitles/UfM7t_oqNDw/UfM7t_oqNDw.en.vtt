00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Today I want to talk to you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about ethnic conflict

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and civil war.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
nor do they generally generate

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
the kind of good news

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that this conference is about.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Yet, not only is there at least some good news

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to be told about fewer such conflicts now

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
than two decades ago,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
but what is perhaps more important

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
is that we also have come

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to a much better understanding of what can be done

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to further reduce the number

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
of ethnic conflicts and civil wars

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and the suffering that they inflict.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Three things stand out:

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
leadership, diplomacy

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and institutional design.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
What I will focus on in my talk

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
is why they matter, how they matter,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and what we can all do

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
to make sure that they continue to matter

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
in the right ways,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that is, how all of us can contribute

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
to developing and honing the skills

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
of local and global leaders

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to make peace

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and to make it last.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
But let's start at the beginning.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Civil wars have made news headlines

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
for many decades now,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and ethnic conflicts in particular

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
have been a near constant presence

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
as a major international security threat.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
For nearly two decades now,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
the news has been bad

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and the images have been haunting.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
In Georgia, after years of stalemate,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in August, 2008.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
This quickly escalated into a five-day war

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
between Russia and Georgia,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
leaving Georgia ever more divided.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
we just heard about them --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
quickly led to high levels

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
of inter-ethnic violence

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and the killing and displacement

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
of thousands of people.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
In Sri Lanka,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
a decades-long civil war

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
between the Tamil minority

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and the Sinhala majority

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
led to a bloody climax in 2009,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
after perhaps as many as 100,000

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
people had been killed

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
since 1983.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
unprecedented levels of violence occurred

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
between ethnic Kyrgyz

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and ethnic Uzbeks.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Hundreds have been killed,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and more than 100,000 displaced,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
including many ethnic Uzbeks

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
In the Middle East,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
continues unabated,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and it becomes ever more difficult

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to see how, just how

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
a possible, sustainable solution

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
can be achieved.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
but the killing and displacement there

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
continues as well,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and the sheer human misery that it creates

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
is very hard to fathom.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And in Iraq, finally,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
violence is on the rise again,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and the country has yet to form a government

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
four months after

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
its last parliamentary elections.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So are these now the images of the past?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
from the Middle East, Darfur,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Iraq, elsewhere,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
there is a longer-term trend

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that does represent some good news.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
there has been an overall decline

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in the number of civil wars.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Since the high in the early 1990s,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
we now have 30 percent fewer

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
such conflicts today.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The number of people killed in civil wars

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
also is much lower today

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
than it was a decade ago or two.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
But this trend is less unambiguous.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
was recorded between 1998 and 2001,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
killed every year.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
The lowest number of combatant casualties

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
occurred in 2003,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
with just 20,000 killed.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Despite the up and down since then,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
the overall trend --

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and this is the important bit --

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
clearly points downward

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
for the past two decades.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
The news about civilian casualties

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
is also less bad than it used to be.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
From over 12,000 civilians

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
deliberately killed in civil wars

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
in 1997 and 1998,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
a decade later,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
this figure stands at 4,000.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
This is a decrease by two-thirds.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
This decline would be even more obvious

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
in 1994.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
in a matter of just a few months.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
This certainly is an accomplishment

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that must never be surpassed.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
What is also important is to note

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
that these figures only tell part of the story.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
They exclude people

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that died as a consequence of civil war,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
from hunger or disease, for example.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And they also do not properly account

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
for civilian suffering more generally.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
have become highly effective,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
To put it differently,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
for the civilians that suffer the consequences

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
of ethnic conflict and civil war,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
there is no good war

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and there is no bad peace.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Thus, even though every civilian killed,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
the fact that the number

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
of civilian casualties

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
is clearly lower today

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
than it was a decade ago,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
is good news.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So, we have fewer conflicts today

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in which fewer people get killed.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And the big question, of course,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
is why?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
In some cases,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
there is a military victory of one side.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
This is a solution of sorts,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
but rarely is it one

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that comes without human costs

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
or humanitarian consequences.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
is perhaps the most recent example of this,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
but we have seen similar

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
so-called military solutions

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and across most of Africa.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
At times, they are complimented

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
by negotiated settlements,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
or at least cease-fire agreements,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and peacekeepers are deployed.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But hardly ever do they represent

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
a resounding success --

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Bosnia and Herzegovina

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
perhaps more so than Georgia.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
But for many parts of Africa,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
a colleague of mine once put it this way,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
"The cease-fire on Tuesday night

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
was reached just in time

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
But let's look at the good news again.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
If there's no solution on the battlefield,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
three factors can account

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
or for sustainable peace afterwards:

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
leadership, diplomacy

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and institutional design.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Take the example of Northern Ireland.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Despite centuries of animosity,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
decades of violence

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and thousands of people killed,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
1998 saw the conclusion

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
of an historic agreement.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Its initial version was skillfully mediated

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
by Senator George Mitchell.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Crucially, for the long-term success

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
of the peace process in Northern Ireland,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
he imposed very clear conditions

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
for the participation and negotiations.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Central among them,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
a commitment

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
to exclusively peaceful means.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Subsequent revisions of the agreement

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
who never wavered in their determination

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
The core institutions

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that were put in place in 1998

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
and their modifications

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
in 2006 and 2008

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
were highly innovative

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and allowed all conflict parties

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
to see their core concerns and demands addressed.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in Northern Ireland

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
with cross-border institutions

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
that link Belfast and Dublin

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and thus recognizes

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And significantly,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
there's also a clear focus

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
on both the rights of individuals

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and the rights of communities.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
The provisions in the agreement may be complex,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
but so is the underlying conflict.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260
local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
not always fast

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and not always enthusiastically,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
but rise in the end they did.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Who ever could have imagined

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
jointly governing Northern Ireland

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
as First and Deputy First Minister?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
or does this kind of explanation

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
only hold more generally

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
in democratic and developed countries?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
By no means.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
in 2003

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
illustrates the importance

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
of leadership, diplomacy

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and institutional design

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
as much as the successful prevention

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
of a full-scale civil war

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
in Macedonia in 2001,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
or the successful ending

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
In all three cases,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
local leaders were willing and able

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
to make peace,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
the international community stood ready

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and the institutions have lived up

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to the promise that they held

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
on the day they were agreed.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Focusing on leadership, diplomacy

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and institutional design

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
also helps explain failures to achieve peace,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
or to make it last.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
did not lead to an end

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
were actually covered in the agreements.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Rather, local leaders committed

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
to revisiting them later on.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
local and international leaders

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
soon disengaged

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
and became distracted

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
signed in 2005

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and its provisions may yet bear the seeds

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
of a full-scale return to war

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
between north and south.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Changes and shortcomings in leadership,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
more off than on international diplomacy

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and institutional failures

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
account for this

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
in almost equal measure.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the ongoing conflict in Darfur,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
escalating tribal violence in the south

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and generally weak state capacity

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
across all of Sudan

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
complete a very depressing picture

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
of the state of affairs

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in Africa's largest country.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
A final example: Kosovo.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
The failure to achieve

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
a negotiated solution for Kosovo

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and the violence, tension

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and de facto partition that resulted from it

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
have their reasons

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
in many, many different factors.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Central among them are three.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
First, the intransigence of local leaders

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
to settle for nothing less

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
than their maximum demands.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Second, an international diplomatic effort

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
that was hampered from the beginning

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
by Western support for Kosovo's independence.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
And third, a lack of imagination

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
when it came to designing institutions

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that could have addressed the concerns

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
of Serbs and Albanians alike.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
By the same token --

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
and here we have some good news again --

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
the very fact that there is a high-level,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
well-resourced international presence

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
in Kosovo

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and the Balkans region more generally

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and the fact that local leaders on both sides

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
have showed relative restraint,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
explains why things have not been worse

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
over the past two years since 2008.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So even in situations

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
where outcomes are less than optimal,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
local leaders

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and international leaders have a choice,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and they can make a difference for the better.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
A cold war

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
is not as good

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
as a cold peace,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
but a cold peace

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
is still better than a hot war.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
Good news is also about learning the right lesson.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
So what then distinguishes

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
from that in Northern Ireland,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
or the civil war in Sudan

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
from that in Liberia?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Both successes and failures

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
teach us several critically important things

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
that we need to bear in mind

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
if we want the good news to continue.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
First, leadership.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.260
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
are not natural

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
but man-made disasters,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
their prevention and settlement

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
does not happen automatically either.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Leadership needs to be capable,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
determined and visionary

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
in its commitment to peace.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Leaders need to connect to each other

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and to their followers,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and they need to bring them along

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
on what is an often arduous journey

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
into a peaceful future.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Second, diplomacy.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
sustained,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
on leaders and followers.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and it needs to ensure

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that a broad coalition

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
of local, regional

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and international supporters

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
help them implement their agreement.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
Third, institutional design.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Institutional design requires

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
a keen focus on issues,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
innovative thinking

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and flexible and well-funded implementation.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Conflict parties need to move away

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
from maximum demands

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
and towards a compromise

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
that recognizes each other's needs.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And they need to think

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
about the substance of their agreement

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
much more than about

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
the labels they want to attach to them.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Conflict parties also need to be prepared

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
to return to the negotiation table

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
if the agreement implementation stalls.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
For me personally,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
the most critical lesson of all is this:

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Local commitment to peace

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
is all-important,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
but it is often not enough

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
to prevent or end violence.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Yet, no amount of diplomacy

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
or institutional design

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
can make up for local failures

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
and the consequences that they have.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Therefore, we must invest

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
in developing leaders,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
leaders that have the skills,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
vision and determination

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
to make peace.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Leaders, in other words,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that people will trust

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
and that they will want to follow

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
even if that means

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
making hard choices.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
A final thought:

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Ending civil wars

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
is a process that is fraught with dangers,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
frustrations and setbacks.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
It often takes a generation to accomplish,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
but it also requires us, today's generation,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
to take responsibility

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and to learn the right lessons

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
about leadership, diplomacy

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and institutional design,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
so that the child soldiers of today

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
can become the children of tomorrow.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Thank you.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
(Applause)
