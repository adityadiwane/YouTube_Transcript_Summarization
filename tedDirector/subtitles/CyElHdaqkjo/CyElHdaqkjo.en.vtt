00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.496
You know, I didn't set out
to be a parenting expert.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.280
In fact, I'm not very interested
in parenting, per Se.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.016
It's just that there's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.216
that is kind of messing up kids,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.296
impeding their chances
to develop into theirselves.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.536
There's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.896
that's getting in the way.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.536
I guess what I'm saying is,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.616
we spend a lot of time
being very concerned

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.296
about parents who aren't involved enough
in the lives of their kids

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.256
and their education or their upbringing,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.480
and rightly so.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.376
But at the other end of the spectrum,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.096
there's a lot of harm
going on there as well,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.056
where parents feel
a kid can't be successful

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.136
unless the parent is protecting
and preventing at every turn

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.896
and hovering over every happening,
and micromanaging every moment,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.120
and steering their kid towards
some small subset of colleges and careers.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.376
When we raise kids this way,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.096
and I'll say we,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.896
because Lord knows,
in raising my two teenagers,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.656
I've had these tendencies myself,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
our kids end up leading
a kind of checklisted childhood.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.896
And here's what the checklisted
childhood looks like.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.816
We keep them safe and sound

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.520
and fed and watered,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.216
and then we want to be sure
they go to the right schools,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.816
that they're in the right classes
at the right schools,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.460
and that they get the right grades
in the right classes in the right schools.

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.216
But not just the grades, the scores,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.456
and not just the grades and scores,
but the accolades and the awards

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.671
and the sports,
the activities, the leadership.

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:51.616
We tell our kids, don't just join a club,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.896
start a club, because colleges
want to see that.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.856
And check the box for community service.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.136
I mean, show the colleges
you care about others.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.256
(Laughter)

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.216
And all of this is done to some
hoped-for degree of perfection.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.856
We expect our kids
to perform at a level of perfection

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.216
we were never asked
to perform at ourselves,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.416
and so because so much is required,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.656
we think,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.896
well then, of course we parents
have to argue with every teacher

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.496
and principal and coach and referee

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.416
and act like our kid's concierge

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.680
and personal handler

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.696
and secretary.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.896
And then with our kids, our precious kids,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.056
we spend so much time nudging,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.496
cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,
nagging as the case may be,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.376
to be sure they're not screwing up,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.896
not closing doors,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.416
not ruining their future,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.696
some hoped-for admission

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.336
to a tiny handful of colleges

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.440
that deny almost every applicant.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.096
And here's what it feels like
to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.616
First of all, there's
no time for free play.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.296
There's no room in the afternoons,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.336
because everything
has to be enriching, we think.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.736
It's as if every piece of homework,
every quiz, every activity

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.296
is a make-or-break moment
for this future we have in mind for them,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.256
and we absolve them
of helping out around the house,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.656
and we even absolve them
of getting enough sleep

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.576
as long as they're checking off
the items on their checklist.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.416
And in the checklisted childhood,
we say we just want them to be happy,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.496
but when they come home from school,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.656
what we ask about all too often first

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.736
is their homework and their grades.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.776
And they see in our faces

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.336
that our approval, that our love,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.976
that their very worth,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.856
comes from A's.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.456
And then we walk alongside them

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.176
and offer clucking praise like a trainer
at the Westminster Dog Show --

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.416
(Laughter)

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.736
coaxing them to just jump a little higher
and soar a little farther,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.816
day after day after day.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.576
And when they get to high school,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.496
they don't say, "Well, what might I
be interested in studying

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.776
or doing as an activity?"

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.496
They go to counselors and they say,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.096
"What do I need to do
to get into the right college?"

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.056
And then, when the grades
start to roll in in high school,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.656
and they're getting some B's,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.056
or God forbid some C's,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.016
they frantically text their friends

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.160
and say, "Has anyone ever gotten
into the right college with these grades?"

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.495
And our kids,

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:35.136
regardless of where they end up
at the end of high school,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.400
they're breathless.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.616
They're brittle.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.456
They're a little burned out.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.376
They're a little old before their time,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.416
wishing the grown-ups in their lives
had said, "What you've done is enough,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.416
this effort you've put forth
in childhood is enough."

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.696
And they're withering now
under high rates of anxiety and depression

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.936
and some of them are wondering,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.320
will this life ever turn out
to have been worth it?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.536
Well, we parents,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.936
we parents are pretty sure
it's all worth it.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.176
We seem to behave --

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.936
it's like we literally think
they will have no future

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.656
if they don't get into one of these
tiny set of colleges or careers

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.000
we have in mind for them.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.016
Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.376
they won't have a future we can brag about

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.200
to our friends and with stickers
on the backs of our cars.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.816
Yeah.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.160
(Applause)

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.456
But if you look at what we've done,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.016
if you have the courage
to really look at it,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.016
you'll see that not only do our kids
think their worth comes

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.736
from grades and scores,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.656
but that when we live right up inside
their precious developing minds

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.256
all the time, like our very own version
of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.216
we send our children the message:

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.456
"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually
achieve any of this without me."

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.136
And so with our overhelp,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.696
our overprotection
and overdirection and hand-holding,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.736
we deprive our kids
of the chance to build self-efficacy,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.456
which is a really fundamental tenet
of the human psyche,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.096
far more important
than that self-esteem they get

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.520
every time we applaud.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.296
Self-efficacy is built when one sees
that one's own actions lead to outcomes,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.536
not --

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.776
There you go.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.640
(Applause)

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.376
Not one's parents'
actions on one's behalf,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.176
but when one's own actions
lead to outcomes.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.696
So simply put,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.056
if our children are to develop
self-efficacy, and they must,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.936
then they have to do a whole lot more
of the thinking, planning, deciding,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.536
doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.696
dreaming and experiencing of life

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.360
for themselves.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.776
Now, am I saying

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.136
every kid is hard-working and motivated

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.336
and doesn't need a parent's involvement
or interest in their lives,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.240
and we should just back off and let go?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.256
Hell no.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.496
(Laughter)

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.216
That is not what I'm saying.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.856
What I'm saying is, when we treat
grades and scores and accolades and awards

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.976
as the purpose of childhood,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.776
all in furtherance of some hoped-for
admission to a tiny number of colleges

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.776
or entrance to a small number of careers,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.176
that that's too narrow a definition
of success for our kids.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.736
And even though we might help them
achieve some short-term wins

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.976
by overhelping --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.560
like they get a better grade
if we help them do their homework,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.200
they might end up with a longer
childhood résumé when we help --

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.496
what I'm saying is that all of this
comes at a long-term cost

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.576
to their sense of self.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.016
What I'm saying is,
we should be less concerned

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.856
with the specific set of colleges

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.096
they might be able
to apply to or might get into

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.016
and far more concerned that they have
the habits, the mindset, the skill set,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.976
the wellness, to be successful
wherever they go.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.216
What I'm saying is,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.816
our kids need us to be a little
less obsessed with grades and scores

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.136
and a whole lot more interested

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.256
in childhood providing
a foundation for their success

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.960
built on things like love

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.456
and chores.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.656
(Laughter)

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.600
(Applause)

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.480
Did I just say chores?
Did I just say chores? I really did.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.080
But really, here's why.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.936
The longest longitudinal study
of humans ever conducted

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.135
is called the Harvard Grant Study.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.496
It found that professional
success in life,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.096
which is what we want for our kids,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.896
that professional success in life
comes from having done chores as a kid,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.936
and the earlier you started, the better,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.336
that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
and-pitch-in mindset,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.736
a mindset that says,
there's some unpleasant work,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.976
someone's got to do it,
it might as well be me,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.216
a mindset that says,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.336
I will contribute my effort
to the betterment of the whole,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.416
that that's what gets you ahead
in the workplace.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.336
Now, we all know this. You know this.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.176
(Applause)

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.776
We all know this, and yet,
in the checklisted childhood,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.576
we absolve our kids of doing
the work of chores around the house,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.096
and then they end up
as young adults in the workplace

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.336
still waiting for a checklist,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.816
but it doesn't exist,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.136
and more importantly,
lacking the impulse, the instinct

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.376
to roll up their sleeves and pitch in

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.976
and look around and wonder,
how can I be useful to my colleagues?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.320
How can I anticipate a few steps ahead
to what my boss might need?

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.880
A second very important finding
from the Harvard Grant Study

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.680
said that happiness in life

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.576
comes from love,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.456
not love of work,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.680
love of humans:

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.840
our spouse, our partner,
our friends, our family.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.296
So childhood needs to teach
our kids how to love,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.296
and they can't love others
if they don't first love themselves,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.296
and they won't love themselves
if we can't offer them unconditional love.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.280
(Applause)

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.800
Right.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.016
And so,

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.296
instead of being obsessed
with grades and scores

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.216
when our precious offspring
come home from school,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.736
or we come home from work,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.536
we need to close our technology,
put away our phones,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.936
and look them in the eye

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.136
and let them see
the joy that fills our faces

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.296
when we see our child
for the first time in a few hours.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.256
And then we have to say,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.480
"How was your day?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.656
What did you like about today?"

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.416
And when your teenage daughter
says, "Lunch," like mine did,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.496
and I want to hear about the math test,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.936
not lunch,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.976
you have to still
take an interest in lunch.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.176
You gotta say, "What was great
about lunch today?"

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.576
They need to know
they matter to us as humans,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.200
not because of their GPA.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.856
All right, so you're thinking,
chores and love,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.376
that sounds all well and good,
but give me a break.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.376
The colleges want to see
top scores and grades

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.320
and accolades and awards,
and I'm going to tell you, sort of.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.976
The very biggest brand-name schools
are asking that of our young adults,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.360
but here's the good news.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.256
Contrary to what the college
rankings racket would have us believe --

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.640
(Applause)

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.936
you don't have to go to one
of the biggest brand name schools

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.696
to be happy and successful in life.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.576
Happy and successful people
went to state school,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.856
went to a small college
no one has heard of,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.456
went to community college,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.216
went to a college over here
and flunked out.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.040
(Applause)

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.216
The evidence is in this room,
is in our communities,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.936
that this is the truth.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.656
And if we could widen our blinders

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.936
and be willing to look
at a few more colleges,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.496
maybe remove our own egos
from the equation,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.176
we could accept and embrace
this truth and then realize,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.176
it is hardly the end of the world

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.720
if our kids don't go to one
of those big brand-name schools.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.216
And more importantly,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.336
if their childhood has not been lived
according to a tyrannical checklist

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.496
then when they get to college,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.456
whichever one it is,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.576
well, they'll have gone there
on their own volition,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.056
fueled by their own desire,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.280
capable and ready to thrive there.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.160
I have to admit something to you.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.856
I've got two kids I mentioned,
Sawyer and Avery.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.576
They're teenagers.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.456
And once upon a time,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.096
I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.896
like little bonsai trees --

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.256
(Laughter)

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.216
that I was going
to carefully clip and prune

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.136
and shape into some perfect
form of a human

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.656
that might just be perfect enough
to warrant them admission

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.120
to one of the most
highly selective colleges.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.920
But I've come to realize, after working
with thousands of other people's kids --

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.360
(Laughter)

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.800
and raising two kids of my own,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.400
my kids aren't bonsai trees.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.520
They're wildflowers

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.216
of an unknown genus and species --

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.136
(Laughter)

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.576
and it's my job to provide
a nourishing environment,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.976
to strengthen them through chores

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.296
and to love them so they can
love others and receive love

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.416
and the college, the major, the career,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.136
that's up to them.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.816
My job is not to make them become
what I would have them become,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.640
but to support them
in becoming their glorious selves.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.616
Thank you.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:15.070
(Applause)
