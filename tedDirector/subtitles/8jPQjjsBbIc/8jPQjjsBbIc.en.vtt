00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.800
A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.096
I had just driven home,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.656
it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.976
I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.776
and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.896
and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.376
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.656
it was very cold.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.896
And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.176
I found I didn't have my keys.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.296
In fact, I could see them
through the window,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.416
lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.576
So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.176
and they were locked tight.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.343
I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.696
but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.880
and it was cold.

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.136
I couldn't go back to my friend
Jeff's house for the night

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.827
because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.090
and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.896
So, desperate and freezing cold,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.536
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.536
cleared out the shards of glass,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.896
I crawled through,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.336
I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.980
figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.776
I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.277
This was going to be expensive,

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:31.856
but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.040
so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.096
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.216
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.776
It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.056
it modulates adrenaline levels

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.560
and it clouds your thinking.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.056
So the next morning,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.536
when I woke up on too little sleep,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.296
worrying about the hole in the window,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.096
and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.816
and the freezing temperatures,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.296
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.856
and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.256
my thinking was cloudy,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.696
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.216
(Laughter)

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.496
And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.776
that I realized I didn't have my passport.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.816
(Laughter)

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.296
So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.776
got my passport,
raced back to the airport,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.616
I made it just in time,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.879
but they had given away
my seat to someone else,

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.879
so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:39.120
in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.336
Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.496
(Laughter)

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.176
And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.136
systems that I can put into place,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.616
that will prevent bad things
from happening?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.536
Or at least if bad things happen,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.560
will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.936
So I started thinking about that,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.818
but my thoughts didn't crystallize
until about a month later.

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:07.536
I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.936
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.376
and, you know, forgotten my passport,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.616
and Danny shared with me

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.136
that he'd been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.896
(Laughter)

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.063
It's something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:26.136
who had written about it
a few years before,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.256
also called the pre-mortem.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.233
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.

00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:31.736
Whenever there's a disaster,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.056
a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.496
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.416
you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.016
and then you try to figure out
what you can do

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.536
to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.496
So what I want to talk to you about today

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.056
are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.976
Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.936
I'll start with the obvious ones.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.040
Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.536
Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.096
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.416
based on the way our spatial memory works.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.296
There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.256
that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.056
to keep track of the locations
of important things --

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.496
where the well is,
where fish can be found,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.016
that stand of fruit trees,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.656
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.585
The hippocampus is the part of the brain

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:38.096
that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.816
It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.698
And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment

00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:47.496
where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.336
and they could still find their nuts.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.176
They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.216
this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.976
But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.456
not so good for things that move around.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.776
So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.296
So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.176
a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.296
For your passport, a particular drawer.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.096
For your reading glasses,
a particular table.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.576
If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.416
your things will always be there
when you look for them.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.656
What about travel?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.056
Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.376
your driver's license, your passport,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.656
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.056
If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.696
Now these are some rather obvious things.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.256
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.496
Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.056
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.336
is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.656
and you should put systems in place.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.616
And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.056
than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.376
And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.776
where we have to make
a very important decision

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.096
about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.776
to help them with a decision.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.416
And so I want to talk about that.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.456
And I'm going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.016
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.056
and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.336
any kind of decision you have to make

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.376
that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.536
So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.680
"I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol's a little high."

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.256
Now, you all know that high cholesterol

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.416
is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.856
heart attack, stroke.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.096
And so you're thinking

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.216
having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.256
and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.056
that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.976
And you've probably heard of statins,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.810
you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.008
in the world today,

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:05.111
you probably even know
people who take them.

00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:07.516
And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."

00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:09.976
But there's a question
you should ask at this point,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.856
a statistic you should ask for

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.336
that most doctors
don't like talking about,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.520
and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.176
It's for the number needed to treat.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.176
Now, what is this, the NNT?

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.256
It's the number of people
that need to take a drug

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.136
or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.536
before one person is helped.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.416
And you're thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.656
The number should be one.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.736
My doctor wouldn't prescribe
something to me

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.045
if it's not going to help.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.553
But actually, medical practice
doesn't work that way.

00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:43.109
And it's not the doctor's fault,

00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:46.053
if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.

00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:48.942
We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.376
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.376
that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.216
So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.376
what do you suppose it is?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.216
How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.440
300.

00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:08.456
This is according to research

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.976
by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.776
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.200
I ran through the numbers myself.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.296
300 people have to
take the drug for a year

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.296
before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.701
Now you're probably thinking,

00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:28.536
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.776
Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway."

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.656
But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.256
and that is, "Tell me
about the side effects." Right?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.936
So for this particular drug,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.616
the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.307
And they include terrible things --

00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:47.775
debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.658
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:51.696
not very likely
it's going to happen to me,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.958
I'll still take the drug."

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:54.176
But wait a minute.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.536
Remember under stress
you're not thinking clearly.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.725
So think about how you're going
to work through this ahead of time,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.948
so you don't have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.

00:09:02.973 --> 00:09:05.465
300 people take the drug, right?
One person's helped,

00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:07.896
five percent of those 300
have side effects,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400
that's 15 people.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.696
You're 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.536
than you are to be helped by the drug.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.465
Now, I'm not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.

00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:22.632
I'm just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:23.976
Medical ethics requires it,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.296
it's part of the principle
of informed consent.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.536
You have the right to have access
to this kind of information

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.456
to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.696
Now you might be thinking

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.416
I've pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.696
but in fact it's rather typical,
this number needed to treat.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.336
For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.576
removal of the prostate for cancer,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.176
the number needed to treat is 49.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.376
That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.056
And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.936
They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.736
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.216
fecal incontinence.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.736
And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.800
they'll only last for a year or two.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.496
So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.056
to the questions
that you might be able to ask

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.456
that will push the conversation forward.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.576
You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.496
And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.296
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.616
do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.416
or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.856
These are things to talk about
and think about now,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.696
with your family and your loved ones.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.216
You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.296
but at least you're practiced
with this kind of thinking.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.936
Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.296
and one of the things
that happens at that moment

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.256
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.185
There's an evolutionary reason for this.

00:10:56.209 --> 00:10:59.616
Face-to-face with a predator,
you don't need your digestive system,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.096
or your libido, or your immune system,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.776
because if you're body is expending
metabolism on those things

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.456
and you don't react quickly,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.456
you might become the lion's lunch,
and then none of those things matter.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.896
Unfortunately,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.536
one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.536
is rational, logical thinking,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.976
as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.176
So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.456
to these kinds of situations.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.656
I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.536
We all are going to fail now and then.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.176
The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.096
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.640
or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.936
Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.696
when I got back from my trip,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.576
I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.136
with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.376
And I have to admit,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.816
I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.416
and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.216
So I'm not completely organized,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.376
but I see organization
as a gradual process,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.616
and I'm getting there.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.856
Thank you very much.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.272
(Applause)
