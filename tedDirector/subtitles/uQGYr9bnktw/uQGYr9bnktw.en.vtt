00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I got invited to speak to the people

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
to perform at sporting events.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Unfortunately I couldn't go.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
But it got me thinking about

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
the fact that these guys, at least most of them,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
know what it is that they do for a living.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
What they do is they dress up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Shortly after that I got invited

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
to speak at the convention of the people

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
who make balloon animals.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
There is a big schism between the ones who make

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
gospel animals and porn animals, but --

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
(Laughter)

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
And the other thing about these guys

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
is, they also know what they do for a living.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
They make balloon animals.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
But what do we do for a living?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
What exactly to the people watching this do every day?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And I want to argue that what we do

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
is we try to change everything.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
That we try to find a piece of the status quo --

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
We try to make big, permanent, important change.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
But we don't think about it that way.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
what that process is like.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And I've been studying it for a couple years.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And I want to share a couple stories with you today.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Cities gave them a charter

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Nathan and his boss saw this,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
and they could not tolerate it.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
So they set out to make San Francisco

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
a no-kill city:

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
create an entire city

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
where every dog and cat,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
unless it was ill or dangerous,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
would be adopted, not killed.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
And everyone said it was impossible.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
flew to San Francisco

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
to testify against them --

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
He connected with people who cared about this:

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
nonprofessionals, people with passion.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
And within just a couple years,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160
San Francisco became the first no-kill city,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
running no deficit, completely supported by the community.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York --

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
a place as different from San Francisco

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
to completely transforming the community.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
And he went to Reno and he did it again.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And when I think about what Nathan did,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And I think about the idea that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
creating an idea, spreading an idea

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
has a lot behind it.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
but what they do is, they take a light bulb

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
and they smash it.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
But one reason is because it indicates a change,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
from before to after.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
It is a moment in time.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And I want to argue that we are living through

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
and are right at the key moment

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
of a change in the way ideas are created

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
and spread and implemented.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
We started with the factory idea:

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
that could churn out change.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
We then went to the TV idea,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
if you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And now we're in this new model of leadership,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
where the way we make change

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
is not by using money

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
or power to lever a system,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
but by leading.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
It enables him to hire men

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
who used to get paid 50 cents a day

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and pay them five dollars a day.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Because he's got an efficient enough factory.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
Well with that sort of advantage

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
you can churn out a lot of cars.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
You can change the fabric of an entire country.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
That the essence of what you're doing is you need

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
ever-cheaper labor,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
and ever-faster machines.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
(Laughter)

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
So we shift gears for a minute,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
and say, "I know: television;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
advertising. Push push.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Take a good idea and push it on the world.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
I have a better mousetrap.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
And you can build an entire industry on that.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
But be careful.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
(Laughter)

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
This model requires you to act like the king,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
like the person in the front of the room

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
throwing things to the peons in the back.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
That you are in charge, and you're going to tell people

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
what to do next.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
The quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
and you are pushing it out to the world.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
This method -- mass marketing --

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
requires average ideas,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
because you're going to the masses,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
and plenty of ads.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
What we've done as spammers

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
is tried to hypnotize everyone

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
into buying our idea,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
(Laughter)

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
But there is good news around the corner -- really good news.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.160
I call it the idea of tribes.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
What tribes are, is a very simple concept

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
that goes back 50,000 years.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And it's something that people have wanted forever.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
having a work tribe,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
having a community tribe.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
thanks to a lot of other things

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
that are bubbling through our society around the world,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
tribes are everywhere.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
You've got the organized armies over here.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
You've got the disorganized rebels over here.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
You've got people in white hats making food.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
And people in white hats sailing boats.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and connect with them,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
because you want to be connected.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
That people on the fringes

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
can find each other, connect and go somewhere.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Every town that has a volunteer fire department

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
understands this way of thinking.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.160
(Laughter)

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
Now it turns out

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
And that what firemen do to train sometimes

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
is they take a house that is going to be torn down,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
But they always stop and take a picture.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
(Laughter)

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
And it turns out that it's tribes --

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
not money, not factories --

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
that can change our world, that can change politics,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
that can align large numbers of people.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
Not because you force them to do something against their will,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
but because they wanted to connect.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
That what we do for a living now,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
all of us, I think,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
is find something worth changing,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.160
and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
that spread the idea and spread the idea.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
it becomes a movement.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
So when Al Gore set out

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
to change the world again,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
he didn't do it by himself.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
He did it by creating a movement.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Thousands of people around the country

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
who could give his presentation for him,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.160
because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
You don't need everyone.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
I don't know, a thousand true fans --

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
a thousand people who care enough

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
that they will get you the next round

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
and the next round and the next round.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
And that means that the idea you create, the product you create,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
the movement you create isn't for everyone,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
What it's about instead

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
is finding the true believers.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
It's easy to look at what I've said so far,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
and say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
They're about the same age. But that's about it.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
What they did, though, is each in their own way,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
created a different way

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
of navigating your way through technology.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
So some people will go out and get people to be on one team.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
And some people will get people to be on the other team.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
It also informs the decisions you make

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
when you make products or services.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
You know, this is one of my favorite devices.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
But what a shame that it's not organized

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
to help authors create movements.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
you could see the comments and quotes and notes

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
Or from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
What would happen if authors, or people with ideas

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
could use version two, which comes out on Monday,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
and use it to organize people

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
who want to talk about something.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
But let me just try a couple.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
The Beatles did not invent teenagers.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
They merely decided to lead them.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
That most movements, most leadership that we're doing

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
is about finding a group that's disconnected

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
but already has a yearning --

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
not persuading people to want something

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
they don't have yet.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
When Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,"

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
her video that spread all across the internet

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
about the way farm animals are treated,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
But she helped organize people,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
and helped turn it into a movement.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me."

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Derek Sivers invented CD Baby,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
which allowed independent musicians

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
to have place to take the mission

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160
What all these people have in common is that they are heretics.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
That heretics look at the status quo and say,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
I see what the status quo is; I don't like it."

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
That instead of looking at all the little rules

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and following each one of them,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.160
that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker --

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
somebody who's half asleep,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
following instructions,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
keeping their head down, fitting in --

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
Someone stands up and says, "This one is important.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
We need to organize around it."

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
You just need a few people --

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
(Laughter) --

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
who will look at the rules,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
realize they make no sense,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and realize how much they want to be connected.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
Zappos isn't a shoe store.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
Zappos is the one, the only,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
the best-there-ever-was

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
place for people who are into shoes to find each other,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
to talk about their passion,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
to connect with people who care more

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
It can be something as prosaic as shoes,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
It's exactly the same behavior though.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
What it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
is to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
then together we can get something that we all want.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
She does it by telling a story

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
to people who want to hear it.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
By connecting a tribe of people

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
who are desperate to be connected to each other.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
By leading a movement and

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
making change.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
And around and around and around it goes.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
So three questions I'd offer you.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
The first one is, who exactly

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
are you upsetting?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
The second question is, who are you connecting?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.160
the connections that are being made, one to the other.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And the third one is, who are you leading?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Because focusing on that part of it --

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
not the mechanics of what you're building,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160
but the who, and the leading part -- is where change comes.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
So Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.160
"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
I gave exactly the same pair to someone

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160
It's a story of a product that tells a story.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
and someone says, "What are those?"

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
on behalf of the people who got the shoes.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
fighting against juvenile diabetes.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.160
connecting them, challenging the status quo

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
because it's important to him.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
You don't need permission from people to lead them.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
But in case you do, here it is:

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
they're waiting, we're waiting

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
for you to show us where to go next.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
the status quo.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
They challenge what's currently there.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
The second thing is, they build a culture.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
A secret language, a seven-second handshake,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
a way of knowing that you're in or out.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
They connect people to one another.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
Do you know what people want more than anything?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
They want to be missed.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
They want to be missed the day they don't show up.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
They want to be missed when they're gone.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
And tribe leaders can do that.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
but you don't need charisma to become a leader.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
Being a leader gives you charisma.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
that's where charisma comes from -- from the leading.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Finally, they commit.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
They commit to the people who are there.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
So I'd like you to do something for me.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
is: create a movement.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.160
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.160
(Applause)
