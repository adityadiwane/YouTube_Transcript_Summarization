00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I am a conductor,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and I'm here today

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
to talk to you about trust.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
My job depends upon it.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
There has to be, between me and the orchestra,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
an unshakable bond of trust,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
born out of mutual respect,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
through which we can spin a musical narrative

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that we all believe in.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Now in the old days, conducting, music making,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Up to and around about the Second World War,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
conductors were invariably dictators --

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
these tyrannical figures

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
within an inch of their lives.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
music has moved on with it.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
a two-way street.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of the outer architecture of that music,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
within which there is then immense personal freedom

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
for the members of the orchestra to shine.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
For myself, of course,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I have to completely trust my body language.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
That's all I have at the point of sale.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
It's silent gesture.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Music)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Ladies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.260
(Applause)

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So in order for all this to work,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I have to trust the orchestra,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
what do you do?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
You overcompensate.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And the bigger your gesture gets,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
the more ill-defined, blurry

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And I remember at the beginning of my career,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I would be going completely insane on the podium,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
just a little upsurge in volume.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
I spent a lot of time in those early years

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
weeping silently in dressing rooms.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
who said, "Conducting, Charles,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is like holding a small bird in your hand.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Now a fundamental

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
has been my adventures in South Africa,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
but a country which, through its musical culture,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
has taught me one fundamental lesson:

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that through music making

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
can come deep levels

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of fundamental life-giving trust.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to form a new opera company.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
So I went out there, and I auditioned,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I heard about 2,000 singers

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and pulled together a company

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
the majority of whom were black,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
but there were a handful of white performers.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that one of those white performers

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
had, in his previous incarnation,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
been a member of the South African police force.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And in the last years of the old regime,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
he would routinely be detailed to go into the township

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to aggress the community.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
the general atmosphere.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Let's be under no illusions.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
is that between a white policeman

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and the black community.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Simply through singing.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
We sang, we sang,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
we sang,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and amazingly new trust grew,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and indeed friendship blossomed.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And that showed me such a fundamental truth,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that music making and other forms of creativity

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
can so often go to places

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
where mere words cannot.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
One of them was "Carmen."

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
which we recorded and shot outside on location

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
for no other reason than to give you proof positive

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:13.260
(Music)

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:22.260
(Applause)

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Something which I find utterly enchanting

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
about South African music making

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
is that it's so free.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
South Africans just make music really freely.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And I think, in no small way,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that's due to one fundamental fact:

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
they're not bound to a system of notation.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
They don't read music.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
They trust their ears.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And then, as if by magic,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
because they can.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music --

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that somehow it's all about skill and systems.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Therefore it's the exclusive preserve

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
of an elite, talented body.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
probably engages with music on a daily basis.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And if I can broaden this out for a second,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
about movies, probably about literature.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
about a piece of classical music?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Why is this?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And what I'm going to say to you now

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
is I'm just urging you to get over

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
this supreme lack of self-confidence,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
fiber, DNA,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
what makes a great piece of music great.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Did you know

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that TED is a tune?

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Now hang on a minute.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
which composers have been using for hundreds of years,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
which proves actually that it does.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G --

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
H, I, J, K, L, M, N,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
T, see it's the same as F in music.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
So T is F.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
had enshrined in its heart

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
the theme, which is TED.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Have a listen.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:41.260
(Music)

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Do you hear it?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Or do I smell some doubt in the room?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Okay, we'll play it for you again now,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
If you'll pardon the expression.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:10:00.260
(Music)

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I think we should make this even more explicit.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
I think we need to sing for our tea.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Will you have a go for me?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Audience: T, E, D.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Shall we try that one again?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
T, E, D.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Audience: T, E, D.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Now we're going to put that in the context of the music.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
(Music)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
One more time,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
You won't make the key otherwise.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Well done, ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
not a bad debut at all.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
because it is all about changing perceptions,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and, indeed, building a new level of trust.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
which as you can imagine,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
if you don't have an experience of it yourself,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
is quite a big thing to take on board.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
aside from her very existence,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
that was hitherto hidden,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
the community of disabled people.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that disability is no barrier

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
to the highest levels of sporting achievement.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
to come to a position of trust,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
to really believe that disability and sports can go together

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
in a convincing and interesting fashion.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
So I find myself asking:

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
where is music in all of this?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
in the U.K. alone,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
with massive musical potential.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So I decided to create a platform for that potential.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
It's going to be Britain's first ever

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
national disabled orchestra.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
It's called Paraorchestra.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
I'm going to show you a clip now

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
of the very first improvisation session that we had.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
It was a really extraordinary moment.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Normally when you improvise --

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and I do it all the time around the world --

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
there's this initial period of horror,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
an awful pregnant silence.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
No one's listening. No one's trusting.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
No one's responding to each other.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
within five minutes

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
a rapt listening, a rapt response

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and some really insanely beautiful music.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:10.260
(Video) (Music)

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
Can I do that one again?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:27.260
(Music)

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
Lyn: When I'm making music,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
I become alive.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:45.260
(Music)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
than walk.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
There's so much joy and things

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I could get from playing an instrument and performing.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260
It's removed some of my paralysis.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:15.260
(Music)

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:22.260
(Applause)

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Paraorchestra is the name of that project.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
please let me know.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Now my parting shot

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
spent the bulk of his life

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Now this prince loved his music,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
a place called Esterhazy --

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
a long way from the big city of Vienna.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Now one day in 1772,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
the prince decreed that the musicians' families,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
the orchestral musicians' families,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
were no longer welcome in the castle.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna --

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.260
You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So given the prince loved his music,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
from the orchestral performance,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and the musicians were reunited with their families.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
that where there is trust,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
there is music -- by extension life.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Where there is no trust,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
the music quite simply withers away.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:06.260
(Music)

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:29.260
(Applause)
