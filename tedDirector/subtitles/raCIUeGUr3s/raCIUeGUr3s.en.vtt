00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.485
How many of you have been to Oklahoma City?

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:15.775
Raise your hand. Yeah?

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:17.924
How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.933
and have no idea who I am? (Laughter)

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.731
Most of you. Let me give you
a little bit of background.

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:27.173
Oklahoma City started in the most

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:28.941
unique way imaginable.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.763
Back on a spring day in 1889,

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:33.350
the federal government held what they called

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.109
a land run.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.803
They literally lined up the settlers

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.426
along an imaginary line,

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:39.851
and they fired off a gun,

00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:41.636
and the settlers roared across the countryside

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.752
and put down a stake,

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.288
and wherever they put down that stake,

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:46.996
that was their new home.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.366
And at the end of the very first day,

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.116
the population of Oklahoma City

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:55.022
had gone from zero to 10,000,

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.363
and our planning department

00:00:56.363 --> 00:01:00.283
is still paying for that.

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:02.780
The citizens got together on that first day

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.032
and elected a mayor.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.839
And then they shot him.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:11.488
(Laughter)

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.430
That's not really all that funny

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.934
-- (Laughter) --

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:17.854
but it allows me to see what type of audience

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.216
I'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.993
The 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.

00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:27.454
Our economy was based on commodities,

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.253
so the price of cotton or the price of wheat,

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.566
and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.678
And along the way, we became a city

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.724
of innovation.

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:41.597
The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:46.737
(Applause)

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:52.037
The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:55.783
You're welcome.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.479
Having an economy, though,

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.626
that relates to commodities
can give you some ups and some downs,

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:03.223
and that was certainly the case
in Oklahoma City's history.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.580
In the 1970s, when it appeared

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.403
that the price of energy would never retreat,

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:09.137
our economy was soaring,

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:12.719
and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.190
The price of energy dropped.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.942
Our banks began to fail.

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:18.500
Before the end of the decade,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.387
100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.

00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:24.938
There was no bailout on the horizon.

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:27.243
Our banking industry, our oil and gas industry,

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.279
our commercial real estate industry,

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.482
were all at the bottom of the economic scale.

00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:35.127
Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:38.042
for Washington and Dallas and Houston
and New York and Tokyo,

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:40.149
anywhere where they could 
find a job that measured up

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.820
to their educational attainment,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.051
because in Oklahoma City,
the good jobs just weren't there.

00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:46.767
But along at the end of the '80s

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.595
came an enterprising businessman

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:51.604
who became mayor named Ron Norick.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.351
Ron Norick eventually figured out

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.288
that the secret to economic development

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.449
wasn't incentivizing companies up front,

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.503
it was about creating a place
where businesses wanted to locate,

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.515
and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.920
that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.232
to build a bunch of stuff.

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:10.207
It built a new sports arena,

00:03:10.207 --> 00:03:12.386
a new canal downtown,

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.747
it fixed up our performing arts center,

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:17.414
a new baseball stadium downtown,

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:19.258
a lot of things to improve the quality of life.

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.671
And the economy indeed seemed to start

00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.703
showing some signs of life.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.061
The next mayor came along.

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:27.838
He started MAPS for Kids,

00:03:27.838 --> 00:03:30.565
rebuilt the entire inner city school system,

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:35.319
all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.540
And then, in 2004,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.244
in this rare collective lack of judgment

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:45.872
bordering on civil disobedience,

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:49.840
the citizens elected me mayor.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.044
Now the city I inherited

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.888
was just on the verge

00:03:53.888 --> 00:03:57.289
of coming out of its slumbering economy,

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:58.980
and for the very first time,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.119
we started showing up on the lists.

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.136
Now you know the lists I'm talking about.

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:05.919
The media and the Internet

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.465
love to rank cities.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.540
And in Oklahoma City,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.221
we'd never really been on lists before.

00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:14.927
So I thought it was kind of cool

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:17.623
when they came out with these
positive lists and we were on there.

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:19.321
We weren't anywhere close to the top,

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.818
but we were on the list, we were somebody.

00:04:22.818 --> 00:04:24.648
Best city to get a job,

00:04:24.648 --> 00:04:26.663
best city to start a business,

00:04:26.663 --> 00:04:28.456
best downtown --

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.930
Oklahoma City.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.235
And then came the list

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:39.781
of the most obese cities in the country.

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.884
And there we were.

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:45.028
Now I like to point out that we were on that list

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:47.526
with a lot of really cool places.

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:48.749
(Laughter)

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.005
Dallas and Houston and New Orleans

00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:53.715
and Atlanta and Miami.

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:55.212
You know, these are cities that, typically,

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.860
you're not embarrassed to be associated with.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.128
But nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:06.473
And about that time, I got on the scales.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.599
And I weighed 220 pounds.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.102
And then I went to this website

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:11.952
sponsored by the federal government,

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:15.625
and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:16.954
and I pushed Enter,

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:21.004
and it came back and said "obese."

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.257
I thought, "What a stupid website."

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:26.132
(Laughter)

00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:32.377
"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese."

00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:34.868
And then I started getting honest with myself

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:39.794
about what had become
my lifelong struggle with obesity,

00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:41.674
and I noticed this pattern,

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.365
that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:47.671
and then about every 10 years,
I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.

00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:49.233
And then I'd do it again.

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.566
And I had this huge closet full of clothes,

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:54.933
and I could only wear a third of it at any one time,

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:59.045
and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:04.595
But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:07.677
Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:10.094
and I knew I could because
I'd done it so many times before,

00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:12.332
so I simply stopped eating as much.

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:13.587
I had always exercised.

00:06:13.587 --> 00:06:15.462
That really wasn't the part of the equation

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.375
that I needed to work on.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:20.204
But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,

00:06:20.204 --> 00:06:22.486
and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:25.377
and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week

00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:29.283
for about 40 weeks.

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:30.828
Along the way, though,

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:34.848
I started examining my city,

00:06:34.848 --> 00:06:38.344
its culture, its infrastructure,

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:41.236
trying to figure out why our specific city

00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:45.635
seemed to have a problem with obesity.

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:47.811
And I came to the conclusion

00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.669
that we had built an incredible quality of life

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.089
if you happen to be a car.

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.324
(Laughter)

00:06:58.324 --> 00:07:01.864
But if you happen to be a person,

00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:06.433
you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:08.706
Our city is very spread out.

00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:12.261
We have a great intersection of highways,

00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.875
I mean, literally no traffic congestion
in Oklahoma City to speak of.

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:18.086
And so people live far, far away.

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:21.671
Our city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:25.216
but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:27.151
You literally can get a speeding ticket

00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.748
during rush hour in Oklahoma City.

00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:33.245
And as a result, people tend to spread out.

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:36.938
Land's cheap.

00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:39.504
We had also not required developers

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.999
to build sidewalks on new developments 
for a long, long time.

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:44.412
We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.806
and there were literally 100,000

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:49.482
or more homes into our inventory

00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:55.560
in neighborhoods that had 
virtually no level of walkability.

00:07:57.864 --> 00:08:00.118
And as I tried to examine

00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:02.091
how we might deal with obesity,

00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.975
and was taking all of these elements into my mind,

00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:07.389
I decided that the first thing we need to do

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.509
was have a conversation.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.468
You see, in Oklahoma City,

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:14.249
we weren't talking about obesity.

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:19.260
And so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.299
I went to the zoo,

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:23.720
and I stood in front of the elephants,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.583
and I said, "This city is going on a diet,

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:31.202
and we're going to lose a million pounds."

00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:32.975
Well, that's when all hell broke loose.

00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:35.753
(Laughter)

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:37.636
The national media

00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:42.153
gravitated toward this story immediately,

00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:45.012
and they really could have 
gone with it one of two ways.

00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:46.543
They could have said,

00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:48.685
"This city is so fat

00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:52.001
that the mayor had to put them on a diet."

00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.504
But fortunately, the consensus was,

00:08:54.504 --> 00:08:56.851
"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.

00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.710
This is a city that's wanting
to do something about it."

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.680
And so they started helping us

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.830
drive traffic to the website.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.348
Now, the web address was

00:09:06.348 --> 00:09:11.329
thiscityisgoingonadiet.com.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:14.748
And I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"

00:09:14.748 --> 00:09:18.168
one weekday morning to talk about the initiative,

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:21.688
and on that day, 150,000 visits

00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:23.508
were placed to our website.

00:09:23.508 --> 00:09:25.082
People were signing up,

00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:27.928
and so the pounds started to add up,

00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:29.535
and the conversation that I thought

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:33.299
was so important to have was starting to take place.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:35.848
It was taking place inside the homes,

00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:38.425
mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:41.086
It was taking place in churches.

00:09:41.086 --> 00:09:43.082
Churches were starting their own running groups

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.370
and their own support groups

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.102
for people who were dealing with obesity.

00:09:47.102 --> 00:09:50.514
Suddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools

00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:52.146
and in the workplace.

00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:54.307
And the large companies, they typically have

00:09:54.307 --> 00:09:55.903
wonderful wellness programs,

00:09:55.903 --> 00:09:57.226
but the medium-sized companies

00:09:57.226 --> 00:10:00.311
that typically fall between the cracks
on issues like this,

00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:03.012
they started to get engaged and used our program

00:10:03.012 --> 00:10:04.868
as a model for their own employees

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.814
to try and have contests to see

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:10.629
who might be able to deal with their obesity situation

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:15.596
in a way that could be proactively
beneficial to others.

00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:20.217
And then came the next stage of the equation.

00:10:20.217 --> 00:10:24.229
It was time to push what I called MAPS 3.

00:10:24.229 --> 00:10:26.429
Now MAPS 3, like the other two programs,

00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:29.093
had had an economic development motive behind it,

00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:31.913
but along with the traditional
economic development tasks

00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:33.675
like building a new convention center,

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.439
we added some health-related infrastructure

00:10:36.439 --> 00:10:38.331
to the process.

00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:41.076
We added a new central park, 70 acres in size,

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:43.466
to be right downtown in Oklahoma City.

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.245
We're building a downtown streetcar

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.493
to try and help the walkability formula

00:10:47.493 --> 00:10:49.545
for people who choose to live in the inner city

00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:52.922
and help us create the density there.

00:10:52.922 --> 00:10:56.277
We're building senior health and wellness centers

00:10:56.277 --> 00:10:57.975
throughout the community.

00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:59.663
We put some investments on the river

00:10:59.663 --> 00:11:02.199
that had originally been invested upon

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:03.879
in the original MAPS,

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:05.823
and now we are currently in the final stages

00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:08.474
of developing the finest venue in the world

00:11:08.474 --> 00:11:11.290
for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.182
We hosted the Olympic trials last spring.

00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:15.586
We have Olympic-caliber events
coming to Oklahoma City,

00:11:15.586 --> 00:11:18.142
and athletes from all over the world moving in,

00:11:18.142 --> 00:11:19.744
along with inner city programs

00:11:19.744 --> 00:11:23.694
to get kids more engaged in these
types of recreational activities

00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:26.494
that are a little bit nontraditional.

00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:30.220
We also, with another initiative that was passed,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.063
are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks

00:11:34.063 --> 00:11:36.462
throughout the metro area.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:38.307
We're even going back into some

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:39.802
inner city situations

00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:41.516
where we had built neighborhoods

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:43.197
and we had built schools

00:11:43.197 --> 00:11:45.123
but we had not connected the two.

00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:47.841
We had built libraries and
we had built neighborhoods,

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:49.446
but we had never really connected the two

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:51.870
with any sort of walkability.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.969
Through yet another funding source,

00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:57.304
we're redesigning all of our inner city streets

00:11:57.304 --> 00:11:58.814
to be more pedestrian-friendly.

00:11:58.814 --> 00:12:00.691
Our streets were really wide,

00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:03.118
and you'd push the button
to allow you to walk across,

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:06.666
and you had to run in order to get there in time.

00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:08.574
But now we've narrowed the streets,

00:12:08.574 --> 00:12:11.482
highly landscaped them, making them
more pedestrian-friendly,

00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.949
really a redesign, rethinking the way

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:15.497
we build our infrastructure,

00:12:15.497 --> 00:12:20.744
designing a city around people and not cars.

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:22.865
We're completing our bicycle trail master plan.

00:12:22.865 --> 00:12:24.683
We'll have over 100 miles

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:27.475
when we're through building it out.

00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:30.736
And so you see this culture starting to shift

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:32.240
in Oklahoma City.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.917
And lo and behold, the demographic changes

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:37.897
that are coming with it are very inspiring.

00:12:37.897 --> 00:12:39.480
Highly educated twentysomethings

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.540
are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.640
and, indeed, even from further away, in California.

00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:51.051
When we reached a million pounds,

00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:53.352
in January of 2012,

00:12:53.352 --> 00:12:55.795
I flew to New York with some our participants

00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:57.325
who had lost over 100 pounds,

00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:59.610
whose lives had been changed,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.781
and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.188
and then that afternoon,
I did a round of media in New York

00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:07.629
pushing the same messages

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:11.725
that you're accustomed to hearing
about obesity and the dangers of it.

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:16.706
And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,

00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:21.082
the same magazine that had put us on that list

00:13:21.082 --> 00:13:23.445
five years before.

00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:26.392
And as I'm sitting in the lobby
waiting to talk to the reporter,

00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.786
I notice there's a magazine copy

00:13:28.786 --> 00:13:31.405
of the current issue right there on the table,

00:13:31.405 --> 00:13:33.061
and I pick it up, and I look at the headline

00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:34.826
across the top, and it says,

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:39.507
"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"

00:13:39.507 --> 00:13:41.652
Well, I knew I did,

00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:43.804
so I picked up the magazine

00:13:43.804 --> 00:13:46.815
and I began to look,

00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:49.561
and we weren't on it.

00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:53.979
(Applause)

00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:58.909
Then I looked on the list of fittest cities,

00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:01.072
and we were on that list.

00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:04.450
We were on the list as the 22nd
fittest city in the United States.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.637
Our state health statistics are doing better.

00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:09.749
Granted, we have a long way to go.

00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:10.888
Health is still not something

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:12.425
that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:16.208
but we seem to have turned the cultural shift

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:19.289
of making health a greater priority.

00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:22.132
And we love the idea of the demographics

00:14:22.132 --> 00:14:23.942
of highly educated twentysomethings,

00:14:23.942 --> 00:14:25.711
people with choices, choosing Oklahoma City

00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:27.160
in large numbers.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.453
We have the lowest unemployment
in the United States,

00:14:29.453 --> 00:14:32.325
probably the strongest economy in the United States.

00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:33.955
And if you're like me, at some point

00:14:33.955 --> 00:14:36.327
in your educational career,

00:14:36.327 --> 00:14:38.544
you were asked to read a book called

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.389
"The Grapes of Wrath."

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:44.423
Oklahomans leaving for California

00:14:44.423 --> 00:14:46.866
in large numbers for a better future.

00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:48.655
When we look at the demographic shifts

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.815
of people coming from the west,

00:14:49.815 --> 00:14:51.443
it appears that what we're seeing now

00:14:51.443 --> 00:14:54.291
is the wrath of grapes.

00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:56.104
(Laughter)

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.169
(Applause)

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:03.714
The grandchildren are coming home.

00:15:03.714 --> 00:15:05.502
You've been a great audience and very attentive.

00:15:05.502 --> 00:15:07.953
Thank you very much for having me here.

00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:10.496
(Applause)
