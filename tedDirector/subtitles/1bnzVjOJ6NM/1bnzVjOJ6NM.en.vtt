00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
One out of two of you women

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
will be impacted by cardiovascular disease

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in your lifetime.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.260
So this is the leading killer of women.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
It's a closely held secret

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
for reasons I don't know.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
In addition to making this personal --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and all women's relationship with their heart --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
we're going to wax into the politics.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Because the personal, as you know, is political.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And not enough is being done about this.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And as we have watched women

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
conquer breast cancer

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
through the breast cancer campaign,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
this is what we need to do now with heart.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Since 1984,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
more women die in the U.S. than men.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
So where we used to think of heart disease

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
as being a man's problem primarily --

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
which that was never true,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and it was in all the textbooks.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It's certainly what I learned when I was training.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
If we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
but if we were going to go forward and be sexist,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
it's actually a woman's disease.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So it's a woman's disease now.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And one of the things that you see

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
is that male line,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And you see the female line since 1984,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
the gap is widening.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
More and more women, two, three, four times more women,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
dying of heart disease than men.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And that's too short of a time period

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
for all the different risk factors that we know

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to change.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
So what this really suggested to us

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
at the national level

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
which had been developed in men, by men, for men

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
for the last 50 years --

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and they work pretty well in men, don't they? --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
weren't working so well for women.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So that was a big wake-up call

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in the 1980's.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Heart disease kills more women

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
at all ages

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
than breast cancer.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And the breast cancer campaign --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
again, this is not a competition.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to address this crisis.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Now sometimes when people see this,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I hear this gasp.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
We can all think of someone,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
often a young woman,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
who has been impacted by breast cancer.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
We often can't think of a young woman

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
who has heart disease.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I'm going to tell you why.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Heart disease kills people,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
often very quickly.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
half of the time it's sudden cardiac death --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
no opportunity to say good-bye,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
no opportunity to help her pick out a wig.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Breast cancer,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
mortality is down to four percent.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And that is the 40 years

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
that women have advocated.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,"

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and it was okay to talk about it.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And then physicians have gone to bat.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
We've done the research.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
We have effective therapies now.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Women are living longer than ever.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
That has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
It's not happening, and it's time.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
to these two women.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
As Barbara depicted

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
in one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,"

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
she portrayed a young woman

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
who wanted an education.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And she wanted to study the Talmud.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And so how did she get educated then?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
She had to impersonate a man.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
She had to look like a man.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and she could have the same rights

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that the men had.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
was a cardiologist.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And right around that time, in the 1980's,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that we saw women and heart disease deaths

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
going up, up, up, up, up,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
she wrote an editorial

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in the New England Journal of Medicine

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and said, the Yentl syndrome.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Women are dying of heart disease,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
two, three, four times more than men.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Mortality is not going down, it's going up.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
And she questioned,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
she hypothesized,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
is this a Yentl syndrome?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And here's what the story is.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Is it because women don't look like men,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
they don't look like that male-pattern heart disease

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
that we've spent the last 50 years understanding

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and getting really good diagnostics

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and really good therapeutics,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And they're just passed.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
They don't get treated, they don't get detected,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Doctor Healy then subsequently became

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
the first female director

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
of our National Institutes of Health.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
in the world.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And it funds a lot of my research.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
It funds research all over the place.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
It was a very big deal

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
for her to become director.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And she started,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
in the face of a lot of controversy,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
the Women's Health Initiative.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And every woman in the room here

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It told us about hormone replacement therapy.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It's informed us about osteoporosis.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So a tremendous fund of knowledge

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
despite, again,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
that so many people told her not to do it,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
it was too expensive.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And the under-reading was women aren't worth it.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
She was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
which is the cardiology part of the NIH.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And we got to do the WISE study --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
It was a study to specifically ask,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
what's going on with women?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Why are more and more women dying

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
of ischemic heart disease?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So in the WISE, 15 years ago,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and we should probably follow up on that."

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
had recently published

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
that when women have heart attacks and die,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
compared to men who have heart attacks and die --

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and again, this is millions of people,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
happening every day --

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
women, in their fatty plaque --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and this is their coronary artery,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle --

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
women erode,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
men explode.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
You're going to find some interesting analogies

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
in this physiology.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
(Laughter)

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Horrible chest pain.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
EKG goes pbbrrhh,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And they go up to the cath lab

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
That's a man heart attack.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Some women have those heart attacks,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
where it erodes,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
EKG findings are different --

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
female-pattern.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
So what do you think happens to these gals?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
They're often not recognized, sent home.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
So we picked up on that

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and we said, "You know, we now have the ability

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
to look inside human beings

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
with these special catheters called IVUS:

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
intravascular ultrasound."

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And we said, "We're going to hypothesize

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
that the fatty plaque in women

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
is actually probably different,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and deposited differently, than men."

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And because of the common knowledge

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
of how women and men get fat.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
When we watch people become obese,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
where do men get fat?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Where do women get fat?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
All over.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Cellulite here, cellulite here.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
So we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
about putting kind of the garbage away,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
smoothly putting it away.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Men just have to dump it in a single area."

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So we said, "Let's look at these."

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and panel A is a man.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Panel B is the woman, very smooth.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
She's just laid it down nice and tidy.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
(Laughter)

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And if you did that angiogram,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
which is the red,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
you can see the man's disease.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So 50 years

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
of honing and crafting these angiograms,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
we easily recognize

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
male-pattern disease.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So that was a discovery.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Now what are the implications of that?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Well once again, women get the angiogram

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and nobody can tell that they have a problem.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So we are working now on a non-invasive --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
again, these are all invasive studies.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And again, 50 years

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
of good non-invasive stress testing,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
we're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
with stress tests.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
in the Women's Heart Center.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
We selected this for the research.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
This is not in your community hospital,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
but we would hope to translate this.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And we're about two and a half years

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
into a five-year study.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
This was the only modality

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that can see the inner lining of the heart.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And if you look carefully, you can see

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that there's a black blush right there.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And that is microvascular obstruction.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
The syndrome, the female-pattern

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
The second reason we really liked MRI

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
is that there's no radiation.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
So unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
for women

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
whose breast is in the way

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
of looking at the heart,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
we say, "Do we really need that test?"

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
So we're very excited about M.R.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
You can't go and order it yet,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
but this is an area of active inquiry

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
where actually studying women

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
is going to advance the field for women and men.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
What are the downstream consequences

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
then, when female-pattern heart disease

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
is not recognized?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
This is a figure

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
from an editorial that I published

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
in the European Heart Journal this last summer.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And it was just a pictogram

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
to sort of show

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
why more women are dying of heart disease,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
despite these good treatments

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
that we know and we have work.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And when the woman

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
has male-pattern disease --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
so she looks like Barbara in the movie --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
they get treated.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
as Barbara does here with her husband,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
they don't get the treatment.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
These are our life-saving treatments.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And those little red boxes are deaths.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
So those are the consequences.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And that is female-pattern

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and why we think the Yentl syndrome

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
actually is explaining

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
a lot of these gaps.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
There's been wonderful news also

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
about studying women,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
finally, in heart disease.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And one of the the cutting-edge areas

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
that we're just incredibly excited about

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
is stem cell therapy.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
If you ask, what is the big difference

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
between women and men physiologically?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Why are there women and men?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Because women bring new life into the world.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
That's all stem cells.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
So we hypothesized

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
that female stem cells might be better

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
at identifying the injury,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
doing some cellular repair

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
or even producing new organs,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
which is one of the things

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
These are female and male stem cells.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And if you had an injured organ,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
if you had a heart attack

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and we wanted to repair that injured area,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
do you want those robust,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
plentiful stem cells on the top?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Or do you want these guys,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that look like they're out to lunch?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
(Laughter)

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And some of our investigative teams

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
have demonstrated

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that female stem cells --

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and this is in animals

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and increasingly we're showing this in humans --

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
that female stem cells,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
when put even into a male body,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
do better than male stem cells

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
going into a male body.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
One of the things that we say

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
about all of this female physiology --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
because again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
women do, on average,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
have better longevity than men --

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and understanding that

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
is going to help men and women.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Okay, so here's where we started.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And remember, paths crossed in 1984,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and more and more women

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
were dying of cardiovascular disease.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
What has happened in the last 15 years with this work?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
We are bending the curve.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
We're bending the curve.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
So just like the breast cancer story,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
doing research, getting awareness going,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it works, you just have to get it going.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Now are we happy with this?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
We still have two to three more women dying for every man.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
And I would propose,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
with the better longevity

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
that women have overall,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
that women probably should theoretically do better,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
if we could just get treated.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
So this is where we are,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
but we have a long row to hoe.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
We've worked on this for 15 years.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
for 50 years.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
So we're 35 years behind.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And in fact, it probably won't.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
But we cannot stop now.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Too many lives are at stake.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
So what do we need to do?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
You now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
with your heart.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Women have heard the call

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
for breast cancer

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and they have come out

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
for awareness campaigns.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
The women are very good about getting mammograms now.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And women do fundraising.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Women participate.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
They have put their money where their mouth is

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
This is what we need to do with heart disease now.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
And it's political.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Women's health, from a federal funding standpoint,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
sometimes it's popular,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
sometimes it's not so popular.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
So we have these feast and famine cycles.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
So I implore you

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
to join the Red Dress Campaign

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
in this fundraising.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
Breast cancer, as we said,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
kills women,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
but heart disease kills a whole bunch more.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
So if we can be as good as breast cancer

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and give women this new charge,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
we have a lot of lives to save.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
So thank you for your attention.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:53.260
(Applause)
