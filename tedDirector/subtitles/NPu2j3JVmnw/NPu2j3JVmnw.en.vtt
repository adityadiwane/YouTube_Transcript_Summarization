00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
which marks the 400th anniversary

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.330
the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
which I think is going to have as profound an impact

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.330
on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
It's called the WorldWide Telescope,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.330
and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and has woven them seamlessly

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.330
to produce a holistic view of the universe.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
It's going to change the way we do astronomy,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
it's going to change the way we teach astronomy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
and I think most importantly

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
that might not be so big a claim.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
gave a great debate in which he argued

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter)

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
all the way back in time,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
We can see across the entire spectrum of light,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.330
We see these magnificent star nurseries,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems --

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
300 now, and still counting --

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
and they're not like us.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
where time itself seems to stand still.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.330
But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
I want to just briefly mention three reasons

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
and why we think it's truly transformative.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.330
First, it enables you to experience the universe:

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
the WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.330
And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.330
but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
who can share their enthusiasm

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
and can make the universe a welcoming place.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And third, you can create your own tours --

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends --

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.330
because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And in telling stories,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
We're going to have a personal universe.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.330
I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
I just want to leave you with this brief thought:

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.330
when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
they often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Well, our gaze fills the universe.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.330
that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Thank you.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.330
(Applause)

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
I can't tell you what a privilege it is

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
but it's one of the tours.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And the tours are all totally interactive,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
so that if I were to go somewhere ...

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
pull up other information --

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
there are lots of Web and information sources

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
about places you might want to go --

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
you can zoom in, you can pull back out.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
The whole resources are there available for you.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.330
So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
is really what makes this project possible.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
It's a labor of love for us and our small team,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.330
and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
So basically, kids of all ages, like us.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.330
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie --

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
which is something new.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
And so, what you've seen today

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
and in the TED Lab, we have a tour

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
that will knock your socks off. (Laughter)

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
So we'll see you there. Thank you.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
(Applause)
