00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.600
Is there life beyond Earth
in our solar system?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.600
Wow, what a powerful question.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.656
You know, as a scientist --

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.896
planetary scientist --

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.480
we really didn't take that
very seriously until recently.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.496
Carl Sagan always said,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.920
"It takes extraordinary evidence
for extraordinary claims."

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.480
And the claims of having life beyond Earth

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.536
need to be definitive,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.176
they need to be loud

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.760
and they need to be everywhere
for us to be able to believe it.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360
So how do we make this journey?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.696
What we decided to do

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920
is first look for
those ingredients for life.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.936
The ingredients of life are:

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.176
liquid water --

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.896
we have to have a solvent,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.000
can't be ice, has to be liquid.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.736
We also have to have energy.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.776
We also have to have organic material --

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.096
things that make us up,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.640
but also things that we need to consume.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.416
So we have to have these elements

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.256
in environments for long periods of time

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.816
for us to be able
to be confident that life,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.136
in that moment when it starts,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.040
can spark and then grow and evolve.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.760
Well, I have to tell you
that early in my career,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.776
when we looked at those three elements,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.056
I didn't believe
that they were beyond Earth

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.176
in any length of time
and for any real quantity.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.456
Why? We look at the inner planets.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.456
Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.496
Mars -- dry and arid.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.056
It's got no water.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.856
And beyond Mars,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.840
the water in the solar system
is all frozen.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.256
But recent observations
have changed all that.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.176
It's now turning our attention
to the right places

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.736
for us to take a deeper look

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.320
and really start to answer
our life question.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.096
So when we look out into the solar system,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.759
where are the possibilities?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.600
We're concentrating our attention
on four locations.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.680
The planet Mars

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.640
and then three moons of the outer planets:

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.480
Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.616
So what about Mars?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.440
Let's go through the evidence.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.456
Well, Mars we thought
was initially moon-like:

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.840
full of craters, arid and a dead world.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.096
And so about 15 years ago,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.736
we started a series
of missions to go to Mars

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.376
and see if water existed
on Mars in its past

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.656
that changed its geology.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.400
We ought to be able to notice that.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.496
And indeed we started
to be surprised right away.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.656
Our higher resolution images
show deltas and river valleys and gulleys

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.360
that were there in the past.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.536
And in fact,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.776
Curiosity --

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.096
which has been roving on the surface
now for about three years --

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.296
has really shown us that it's sitting
in an ancient river bed,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.720
where water flowed rapidly.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.736
And not for a little while,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.240
perhaps hundreds of millions of years.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.416
And if everything was there,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.776
including organics,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.656
perhaps life had started.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.576
Curiosity has also
drilled in that red soil

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.576
and brought up other material.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.256
And we were really excited
when we saw that.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.296
Because it wasn't red Mars,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.936
it was gray material,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.256
it's gray Mars.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.736
We brought it into the rover,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.376
we tasted it,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.856
and guess what?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.896
We tasted organics --

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.296
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.816
nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur --

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.216
they were all there.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.736
So Mars in its past,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.096
with a lot of water,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.096
perhaps plenty of time,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.536
could have had life,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.800
could have had that spark,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.296
could have grown.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.616
And is that life still there?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.616
We don't know that.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.056
But a few years ago

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.416
we started to look at a number of craters.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.656
During the summer,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.696
dark lines would appear
down the sides of these craters.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.976
The more we looked,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.456
the more craters we saw,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.816
the more of these features.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.720
We now know more than a dozen of them.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.536
A few months ago the fairy tale came true.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.656
We announced to the world
that we know what these streaks are.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.280
It's liquid water.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.576
These craters are weeping
during the summer.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.536
Liquid water is flowing
down these craters.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.296
So what are we going to do now --

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.760
now that we see the water?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.736
Well, it tells us that Mars has
all the ingredients necessary for life.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.336
In its past it had perhaps
two-thirds of its northern hemisphere --

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.856
there was an ocean.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.776
It has weeping water right now.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.576
Liquid water on its surface.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.216
It has organics.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.480
It has all the right conditions.

00:05:24.103 --> 00:05:26.016
So what are we going to do next?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.456
We're going to launch a series of missions

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.256
to begin that search for life on Mars.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.760
And now it's more appealing
than ever before.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.296
As we move out into the solar system,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.296
here's the tiny moon Enceladus.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.696
This is not in what we call
the traditional habitable zone,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.936
this area around the sun.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.816
This is much further out.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.520
This object should be
ice over a silicate core.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.816
But what did we find?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.776
Cassini was there since 2006,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.176
and after a couple years
looked back after it flew by Enceladus

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.896
and surprised us all.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.696
Enceladus is blasting sheets of water
out into the solar system

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.000
and sloshing back down onto the moon.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.936
What a fabulous environment.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.776
Cassini just a few months ago
also flew through the plume,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.200
and it measured silicate particles.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.656
Where does the silica come from?

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.040
It must come from the ocean floor.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.936
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.096
pulling and squeezing this moon --

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.776
is melting that ice,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.256
creating an ocean.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.600
But it's also doing that to the core.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.456
Now, the only thing that we can think of

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.320
that does that here on Earth
as an analogy ...

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.240
are hydrothermal vents.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.056
Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean
were discovered in 1977.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.840
Oceanographers were completely surprised.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.840
And now there are thousands
of these below the ocean.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.456
What do we find?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.816
The oceanographers, when they go
and look at these hydrothermal vents,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.136
they're teeming with life,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.696
regardless of whether the water
is acidic or alkaline --

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.256
doesn't matter.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.000
So hydrothermal vents are
a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.440
So what about Enceladus?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.056
Well, we believe because it has water

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.840
and has had it for
a significant period of time,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.376
and we believe it has hydrothermal vents

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.760
with perhaps the right organic material,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.616
it is a place where life could exist.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.536
And not just microbial --

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.280
maybe more complex
because it's had time to evolve.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.616
Another moon, very similar,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.176
is Europa.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.016
Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.880
and made fabulous observations of Europa.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.856
Europa, we also know,
has an under-the-ice crust ocean.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.256
Galileo mission told us that,
but we never saw any plumes.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.000
But we didn't look for them.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.936
Hubble,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.776
just a couple years ago,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.776
observing Europa,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.336
saw plumes of water

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.336
spraying from the cracks
in the southern hemisphere,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.120
just exactly like Enceladus.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.456
These moons,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.256
which are not in what we call
a traditional habitable zone,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.256
that are out in the solar system,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.056
have liquid water.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.056
And if there are organics there,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.280
there may be life.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.775
This is a fabulous set of discoveries

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:50.015
because these moons
have been in this environment like that

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.240
for billions of years.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.360
Life started here on Earth, we believe,
after about the first 500 million,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.120
and look where we are.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.800
These moons are fabulous moons.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.880
Another moon that we're
looking at is Titan.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.736
Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.280
It perhaps is much larger
than the planet Mercury.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.976
It has an extensive atmosphere.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.616
It's so extensive --

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.216
and it's mostly nitrogen
with a little methane and ethane --

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.656
that you have to peer
through it with radar.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.160
And on the surface,
Cassini has found liquid.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.360
We see lakes ...

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.296
actually almost the size
of our Black Sea in some places.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.416
And this area is not liquid water;

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.680
it's methane.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.080
If there's any place in the solar system
where life is not like us,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.616
where the substitute of water
is another solvent --

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.016
and it could be methane --

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.320
it could be Titan.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.896
Well, is there life beyond Earth
in the solar system?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.176
We don't know yet,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.256
but we're hot on the pursuit.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.896
The data that we're receiving
is really exciting

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.296
and telling us --

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.280
forcing us to think about this
in new and exciting ways.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.256
I believe we're on the right track.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.136
That in the next 10 years,
we will answer that question.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.096
And if we answer it,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.976
and it's positive,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.760
then life is everywhere
in the solar system.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.576
Just think about that.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.200
We may not be alone.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.456
Thank you.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.637
(Applause)
