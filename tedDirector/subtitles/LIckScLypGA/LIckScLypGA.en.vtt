00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
(Music)

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
(Applause)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I directed a movie two years ago

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
called "Step Up 2: The Streets."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
amazing, the best in the world --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
street culture that blew my mind.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I mean, this is literally human beings

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
with super-human strength and abilities.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I'd never seen anything like that.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
When I was growing up, my heroes were people like

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I grew up in a musical family.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.260
(Laughter)

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Applause)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
But after seeing what I've seen,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
They're here, getting better and better every day.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And dance has progressed.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
It is insane what dance is right now.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Dance has never had a better friend than technology.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Online videos and social networking ...

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
from a YouTube video created in Detroit,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
building on it within days and releasing a new video,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And this is happening every day.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
with cheap webcams,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and may not have that opportunity, except for us.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So, we created the LXD,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
a justice league of dancers that believe

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
A living, breathing comic book series,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
these guys can actually do it.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
some of our heroes right now.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
We got Madd Chadd,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.260
(Applause)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
I get a lot of different reactions actually.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but sometimes they get a little freaked out.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
(Music)

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
(Applause)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it --

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I actually visually kind of picture

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
lines, and moving them.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I think of like, Transformers,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
like how panels open and then they fold,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
they fold in, and then you close that panel.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And then another thing opens,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
you close that.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Music)

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.260
(Applause)

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
I don't really know what's going on

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
when I'm dancing.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
It's not really a conscious decision,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
It's kind of like this other level

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
where you can't make choices anymore,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
I got my name just because I was so young.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Music)

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:16.260
(Applause)

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
L'il C: I tell them to create a ball,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and then you just use that ball of energy.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And instead of throwing it out, people would think

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that's a krump move, that's a krump move.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
you throw it out, and you hold it.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And you just got this piece of energy

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and you just, you're manipulating it.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.260
You know, you create power, then you tame it.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
(Music)

00:10:51.260 --> 00:11:03.260
(Applause)

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
(Music)

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.260
(Applause)
