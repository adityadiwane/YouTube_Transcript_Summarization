00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Every presentation needs this slide in it.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
(Laughter)

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Do you see?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
All the points, all the lines --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
it's incredible.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It is the network;

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and in my case, the network has been important in media,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
because I get to connect to people.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Isn't it amazing?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Through that, I connect to people.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And the way that I've been doing it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
has been multifaceted.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.260
(Laughter)

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
where I ask people

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
to try and simultaneously place

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
two pieces of bread

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And people started laying bread in tribute,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and eventually a team was able to do it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
between New Zealand and Spain.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Connecting to people in projects

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
like YoungmeNowme for example.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
to find a childhood photograph of themselves

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and restage it as an adult.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:37.260
(Laughter)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
This is the same person --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Poignant.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
This was a Mother's Day gift.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
(Laughter)

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Particularly creepy.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
(Applause)

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
with a little baby on her lap,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and the next photo is a 220-lb man

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But this project changed the way

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that I thought about connecting to people.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
This is project called Ray.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and had no idea who generated the audio.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this."

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And this is what came to me.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Recording: Hi, my name is Ray,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and on yesterday my daughter called me

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
because she was stressed out

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
because of things that were going on on her job

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that she felt was quite unfair.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and I didn't really know what to tell her,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
So I was led to write this song just for her,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
just to give her some encouragement

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
for all employees under stress

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Here's how the song goes.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.260
♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.260
♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.260
♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Now you might not be able to sing that out loud,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
All right. Stay strong. Peace.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Ze Frank: So -- yeah.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So I was so moved by this --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
this is incredible. This was connecting, right.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
This was, at a distance,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
realizing that someone was feeling something,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
wanting to affect them in a particular way,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
using media to do it, putting it online

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and realizing that there was a greater impact.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
It's actually in the key of B flat.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And have to do something with it."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
One stood out in particular.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
It was done by a guy named Goose.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Remix: ♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.260
♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
♫ You gonna have to send me home ♫

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.260
♫ Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
♫ I'm about to whip some ♫ --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
ZF: Great, so it was incredible.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
That song -- (Applause) Thank you.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
in Kansas City.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
In the end,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
it was one of the top downloads

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
on a whole bunch of music streaming services.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
if you can figure out who this person is,"

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
because all I had was his name -- Ray --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and this little piece of audio

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and the fact that his daughter was upset.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
In two weeks, they found him.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
I received and email and it said,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
"Hi, I'm Ray.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I heard you were looking for me."

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
(Laughter)

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It's been an interesting two weeks."

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And so I flew to St. Louis

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and met Ray,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and he's a preacher --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
(Laughter)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
among other things.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So but anyways, here's the thing --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
is it reminds me of this,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
I look at this photo, and he seems really interested

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
in what's going on with that button,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
(Laughter)

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And it makes me think of this.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and it's easy to dismiss this

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
as some sort of bad trend

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
in human culture.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But the truth is

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
life is being lived there.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
When they smile --

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
right, you've seen people stop --

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
all of a sudden, life is being lived there,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
somewhere up in that weird, dense network.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
It's the fundamental force

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
that we're all after.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
We can build all sorts of environments

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
to make it a little bit easier,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
but ultimately, what we're trying to do

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
is really connect with one other person.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and we have to get better at figuring that out.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
a lot of them aren't very good

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
at connecting with people.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
This is kind of like something I used to do

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
in third grade.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Laughter)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So here's a series of projects

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
over the last few years

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
where I've been inspired by trying to figure out

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
how to really facilitate close connection.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Sometimes they're very, very simple things.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
A Childhood Walk, which is a project

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
where I ask people to remember a walk

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that they used to take as a child over and over again

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that was sort of meaningless --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and take it inside of Google Streetview.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And I promise you,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
if you take that walk inside Google Streetview,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
you come to a moment

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
where something comes back

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and hits you in the face.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And I collected those moments --

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
the photos inside Google Streetview

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and the memories, specifically.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot."

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
"Right after he told me and my brother

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
he was going to be separating from my mom,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I remember walking to a convenience store

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and getting a cherry cola."

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
He died long after he left the pillow at my house,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
but we never got around to returning it."

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
This is Pain Pack.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Right after September 11th, last year,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
the way that we excise it from our bodies.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So what I did is I opened up a hotline --

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
not necessarily related to that event.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And people called in and left messages like this.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Recording: Okay, here's something.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I'm not alone,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and I am loved.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
I'm really fortunate.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
But sometimes I feel really lonely.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And when I feel that way

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
even the smallest act of kindness

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
can make me cry.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Like even people in convenience stores

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
saying, "Have a nice day,"

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
when they're accidentally looking me in the eye.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and with their permission, converted them to MP3s

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and distributed them to sound editors

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
who created short sounds

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
using just those voicemails.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And those were then distributed to DJs

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
who have made hundreds of songs

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
using that source material.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
(Music)

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
We don't have time to play much of it.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
You can look at it online.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
"From 52 to 48 with love"

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
was a project around the time of the last election cycle,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
where McCain and Obama both,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and I was like, "What the hell

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
does that look like?"

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
And so some really nice things came together.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
"I voted blue. I voted red.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Together, for our future."

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
These are very, very cute little things right.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Some came from the winning party.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always."

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Some came from the party who had just lost.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
but I doubt it."

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
apparently found it to be a little patronizing,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
which I could also see.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
death threats even.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and he was dressed as Batman.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Just in case I thought the real Batman

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
was coming after me;

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
which actually made me feel a little better --

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
like, "Phew, it's not him."

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
So what I did --

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
awful experience and this pain inside of me,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and it started to eat away at my psyche.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
I didn't want this special, little group of photographs

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
to get sullied in some way.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
So what I did, I took all those emails,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and I put them together into something called Angrigami,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
which was an origami template

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
made out of this sort of vile stuff.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And I asked people to send me beautiful things

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
made out of the Angrigami.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.260
(Laughter)

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But this was the emotional moment.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
It's amazing.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
called Songs You Already Know,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
where the idea was,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
I was trying to figure out to address

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
particular kinds of emotions with group projects.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
So one of them was fairly straightforward.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
A guy said that his daughter got scared at night

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and could I write a song for her, his daughter.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And I said, "Oh yeah,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
to help herself go to sleep."

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And this was "Scared."

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.260
(Video) ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.260
♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
♫ And somehow I get over it ♫

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.260
♫ I keep on trying despite ♫

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.260
♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
♫ I keep on trying despite ♫

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.260
♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Okay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and she actually was singing that song to herself.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great."

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
And I don't have much time.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
But the idea was that at one point

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
where I wanted to experience what it was like

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
to live as another person.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And I shut that part down.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And I chose two people to be,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and I asked them to send me descriptions

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
of how to act as them on Facebook.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
One person sent me a very detailed description;

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
the other person didn't.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And the person who didn't, it turned out,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
I was like, "I don't know.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Didn't know I had one."

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
But anyway, this same person, Laura,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And I felt badly for not having done a good job.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety."

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
So she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And so what I decided to do.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it."

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
(Audio) ♫ Hey ♫

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
♫ You're okay ♫

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
♫ You'll be fine ♫

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So I asked people

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
whether they had basic audio capabilities,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
so I could just get their voices back.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And this is the kind of thing that I got back.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Recording: ♫ Hey ♫

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260

♫ You'll be fine ♫

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And when you put them together, something magical happens,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
something absolutely incredible happens,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
I just want to say thanks for even considering it."

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
And then a few days later I sent her this.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:13.260

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.260
