00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
What's in the box?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Whatever it is must be pretty important,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
because I've traveled with it, moved it,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
from apartment to apartment to apartment.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
(Laughter)

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(Applause)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Sound familiar?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Did you know that we Americans

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
have about three times the amount of space

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
we did 50 years ago?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Three times.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So you'd think, with all this extra space,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Nope.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
There's a new industry in town,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry:

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that of personal storage.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
So we've got triple the space,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
but we've become such good shoppers

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that we need even more space.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
So where does this lead?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Lots of credit card debt,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
huge environmental footprints,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and perhaps not coincidentally,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that less might actually equal more.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I bet most of us have experienced at some point

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
the joys of less:

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
college -- in your dorm,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
traveling -- in a hotel room,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
camping -- rig up basically nothing,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
maybe a boat.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
this gave you a little more freedom,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
a little more time.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So I'm going to suggest

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that less stuff and less space

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
are going to equal a smaller footprint.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
It's actually a great way to save you some money.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
to further this conversation

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and to find some great solutions in this area.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I wanted it all --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
home office, sit down dinner for 10,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
room for guests,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and all my kite surfing gear.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
With over 300 entries from around the world,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I got it, my own little jewel box.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
instead of 600,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
immediately I'm saving 200 grand.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities --

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
save some more money there,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
but also a smaller footprint.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And because it's really designed

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff --

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and really designed for me,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I'm really excited to be there.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So how can you live little?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Three main approaches.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
It's time for me to let it go.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We need to think before we buy.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Ask ourselves,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
"Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
By all means,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
we should buy and own some great stuff.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
not just stuff.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Secondly, our new mantra:

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
small is sexy.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We want space efficiency.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
We want things that are designed

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
for how they're used the vast majority of the time,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
not that rare event.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Why have a six burner stove

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
when you rarely use three?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So we want things that nest,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
You can take paperwork,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
books, movies,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and you can make it disappear -- it's magic.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares --

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
a sink combined with a toilet,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
a dining table becomes a bed --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
same space,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
a little side table

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
stretches out to seat 10.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
to get a lot out of the space.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Look at the coffee table --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
it grows in height and width

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to seat 10.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
My office folds away,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
easily hidden.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Guests? Move the moving wall,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
have some fold-down guest beds.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And of course, my own movie theater.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So I'm not saying that we all need to live

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
in 420 sq. ft.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
But consider the benefits of an edited life.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Go from 3,000 to 2,000,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
from 1,500 to 1,000.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Most of us, maybe all of us,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
are here pretty happily for a bunch of days

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
with a couple of bags,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
maybe a small space, a hotel room.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So when you go home and you walk through your front door,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
take a second and ask yourselves,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
"Could I do with a little life editing?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Would that give me a little more freedom?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Maybe a little more time?"

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
What's in the box?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
It doesn't really matter.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I know I don't need it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
What's in yours?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Maybe, just maybe,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
less might equal more.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
So let's make room

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
for the good stuff.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Thank you.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.260
(Applause)
