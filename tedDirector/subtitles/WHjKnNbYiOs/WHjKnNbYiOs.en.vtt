00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.456
On January 26, 2013,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.976
a band of al-Qaeda militants
entered the ancient city of Timbuktu

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.256
There, they set fire to a medieval library
of 30,000 manuscripts

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.056
written in Arabic
and several African languages

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.816
and ranging in subject from astronomy
to geography, history to medicine,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.536
including one book which records

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.480
perhaps the first treatment
for male erectile dysfunction.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.056
Unknown in the West,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.496
this was the collected wisdom
of an entire continent,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.600
the voice of Africa at a time when Africa
was thought not to have a voice at all.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.976
The mayor of Bamako,
who witnessed the event,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.936
called the burning of the manuscripts

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.200
"a crime against world cultural heritage."

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.416
And he was right --

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.880
or he would have been, if it weren't
for the fact that he was also lying.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.296
In fact, just before,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.456
African scholars had collected
a random assortment of old books

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.976
and left them out
for the terrorists to burn.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.936
Today, the collection
lies hidden in Bamako,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.336
the capital of Mali,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.456
moldering in the high humidity.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.336
What was rescued by ruse

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.096
is now once again in jeopardy,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.360
this time by climate.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.616
But Africa, and the far-flung
corners of the world,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.936
are not the only places,
or even the main places

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.256
in which manuscripts that could change
the history of world culture

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800
are in jeopardy.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.656
Several years ago, I conducted
a survey of European research libraries

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.936
and discovered that,
at the barest minimum,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.176
there are 60,000 manuscripts

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.816
pre-1500

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.776
that are illegible
because of water damage,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.776
fading, mold and chemical reagents.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.776
The real number is likely double that,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.976
and that doesn't even count

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.616
Renaissance manuscripts
and modern manuscripts

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.760
and cultural heritage
objects such as maps.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.416
What if there were a technology

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.776
that could recover
these lost and unknown works?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.216
Imagine worldwide
how a trove of hundreds of thousands

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.176
of previously unknown texts

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.240
could radically transform
our knowledge of the past.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.296
Imagine what unknown classics
we would discover

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.656
which would rewrite the canons
of literature, history,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120
philosophy, music --

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.376
or, more provocatively, that could
rewrite our cultural identities,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
building new bridges
between people and culture.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.056
These are the questions
that transformed me

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.896
from a medieval scholar,
a reader of texts,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.720
into a textual scientist.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.416
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.016
For me, it conjures up
images of passivity,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.456
of someone sitting idly in an armchair

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.776
waiting for knowledge to come to him

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.496
in a neat little parcel.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.536
How much better to be
a participant in the past,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.736
an adventurer in an undiscovered country,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.160
searching for the hidden text.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.800
As an academic, I was a mere reader.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.976
I read and taught the same classics

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.136
that people had been reading
and teaching for hundreds of years --

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.176
Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.536
and with every scholarly article
that I published

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.760
I added to human knowledge
in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.336
What I wanted to be

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.456
was an archaeologist of the past,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.056
a discoverer of literature,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.976
an Indiana Jones without the whip --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.496
or, actually, with the whip.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.736
(Laughter)

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.456
And I wanted it not just for myself
but I wanted it for my students as well.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.376
And so six years ago,
I changed the direction of my career.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.416
At the time, I was working
on "The Chess of Love,"

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.296
the last important long poem
of the European Middle Ages

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.936
never to have been edited.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.976
And it wasn't edited because
it existed in only one manuscript

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.256
which was so badly damaged
during the firebombing of Dresden

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.496
in World War II

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.400
that generations of scholars
had pronounced it lost.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.856
For five years, I had been working
with an ultraviolet lamp

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.776
trying to recover traces of the writing

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.216
and I'd gone about as far
as technology at the time

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.616
could actually take me.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.736
And so I did what many people do.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.776
I went online,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.536
and there I learned about

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.136
how multispectral imaging had been used
to recover two lost treatises

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.056
of the famed Greek
mathematician Archimedes

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.616
from a 13th-century palimpsest.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.920
A palimpsest is a manuscript
which has been erased and overwritten.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.456
And so, out of the blue,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.536
I decided to write
to the lead imaging scientist

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.776
on the Archimedes palimpsest project,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.296
Professor Roger Easton,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.136
with a plan and a plea.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.200
And to my surprise,
he actually wrote back.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.656
With his help, I was able
to win a grant from the US government

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.696
to build a transportable,
multispectral imaging lab,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.536
And with this lab, I transformed
what was a charred and faded mess

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560
into a new medieval classic.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.136
So how does multispectral
imaging actually work?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.616
Well, the idea
behind multispectral imaging

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.936
is something that anyone who is familiar
with infrared night vision goggles

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.336
will immediately appreciate:

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.856
that what we can see
in the visible spectrum of light

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.200
is only a tiny fraction
of what's actually there.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.920
The same is true with invisible writing.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.456
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.976
between the ultraviolet and the infrared,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.056
and these are shown down
onto the manuscript from above

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.696
from banks of LEDs,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.576
and another multispectral light source

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.553
which comes up through
the individual leaves of the manuscript.

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:52.096
Up to 35 images per sequence
per leaf are imaged this way

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.740
using a high-powered digital camera
equipped with a lens

00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:56.736
which is made out of quartz.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.856
There are about five
of these in the world.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.696
And once we capture these images,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.776
we feed them through
statistical algorithms

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.296
to further enhance and clarify them,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.696
using software which was originally
designed for satellite images

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.096
and used by people
like geospatial scientists

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.320
and the CIA.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.336
The results can be spectacular.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.536
You may already have heard
of what's been done

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.936
for the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.520
which are slowly gelatinizing.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.136
Using infrared, we've been able
to read even the darkest corners

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.880
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.336
You may not be aware, however,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.096
of other Biblical texts
that are in jeopardy.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.536
Here, for example,
is a leaf from a manuscript

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.336
that we imaged,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.240
which is perhaps the most valuable
Christian Bible in the world.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.656
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest
translation of the Gospels into Latin,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.280
and it dates from the first half
of the fourth century.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.816
This is the closest we can come

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.776
to the Bible at the time
of the foundation of Christendom

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.416
under Emperor Constantine,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.976
and at the time also
of the Council of Nicaea,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.496
when the basic creed of Christianity
was being agreed upon.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.776
This manuscript, unfortunately,
has been very badly damaged,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.016
and it's damaged because for centuries

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.496
it had been used and handled

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.216
in swearing in ceremonies in the church.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.896
In fact, that purple splotch
that you see in the upper left hand corner

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.216
is Aspergillus, which is a fungus

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.776
which originates in the unwashed hands

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800
of a person with tuberculosis.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.696
Our imaging has enabled me
to make the first transcription

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.320
of this manuscript in 250 years.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.256
Having a lab that can travel
to collections where it's needed, however,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.760
is only part of the solution.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.336
The technology is expensive and very rare,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.576
and the imaging and image
processing skills are esoteric.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.296
That means that mounting recoveries

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.216
is beyond the reach of most researchers
and all but the wealthiest institutions.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.016
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.696
a not-for-profit initiative

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.696
to bring multispectral imaging
to individual researchers

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.560
and smaller institutions
at little or no cost whatsoever.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.176
Over the past five years,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.056
our team of imaging scientists,
scholars and students

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.256
has travelled to seven different countries

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.136
and have recovered some of the world's
most valuable damaged manuscripts,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
included the Vercelli Book,
which is the oldest book of English,

00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:28.800
the Black Book of Carmarthen,
the oldest book of Welsh,

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:32.296
and some of the most valuable
earliest Gospels

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.200
located in what is now
the former Soviet Georgia.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.560
So, spectral imaging
can recover lost texts.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.456
More subtly, though, it can recover
a second story behind every object,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.176
the story of how, when
and by whom a text was created,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.600
and, sometimes, what the author
was thinking at the time he wrote.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.696
Take, for example, a draft
of the Declaration of Independence

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.136
written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.589
which some colleagues of mine
imaged a few years ago

00:09:02.613 --> 00:09:03.933
at the Library of Congress.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.056
Curators had noticed
that one word throughout

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.456
had been scratched out and overwritten.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.560
The word overwritten was "citizens."

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.840
Perhaps you can guess
what the word underneath was.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.376
"Subjects."

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.216
There, ladies and gentlemen,
is American democracy

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.320
evolving under the hand
of Thomas Jefferson.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.216
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.576
which we imaged
at Yale's Beinecke Library.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.056
This was the map
that Columbus likely consulted

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.776
before he traveled to the New World

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.536
and which gave him his idea
of what Asia looked like

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.160
and where Japan was located.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.656
The problem with this map
is that its inks and pigments

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.776
had so degraded over time

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.936
that this large, nearly seven-foot map,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.040
made the world look like a giant desert.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.136
Until now, we had very little idea,
detailed idea, that is,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.816
of what Columbus knew of the world

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.760
and how world cultures were represented.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.376
The main legend of the map
was entirely illegible under normal light.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.656
Ultraviolet did very little for it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.680
Multispectral gave us everything.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.216
In Asia, we learned of monsters
with ears so long

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.560
that they could cover
the creature's entire body.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.440
In Africa, about a snake
who could cause the ground to smoke.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.936
Like starlight, which can convey images

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.536
of the way the Universe
looked in the distant past,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.456
so multispectral light can take us back
to the first stuttering moments

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.760
of an object's creation.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.416
Through this lens, we witness
the mistakes, the changes of mind,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.336
the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.576
the imperfections of the human imagination

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.416
that allow these hallowed objects
and their authors

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.096
to become more real,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.640
that make history closer to us.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.040
What about the future?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.656
There's so much of the past,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.896
and so few people
with the skills to rescue it

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.800
before these objects disappear forever.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.776
That's why I have begun to teach
this new hybrid discipline

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.696
that I call "textual science."

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.336
Textual science is a marriage

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.736
of the traditional skills
of a literary scholar --

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.296
the ability to read old languages
and old handwriting,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.016
the knowledge of how texts are made

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.176
in order to be able
to place and date them --

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.936
with new techniques like imaging science,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.536
the chemistry of inks and pigments,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.960
computer-aided optical
character recognition.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.336
Last year, a student in my class,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.576
a freshman,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.416
with a background in Latin and Greek,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.776
was image-processing a palimpsest

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.520
that we had photographed
at a famous library in Rome.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.000
As he worked, tiny Greek writing
began to appear from behind the text.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.696
Everyone gathered around,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.376
and he read a line from a lost work

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.720
of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.456
This was the first time
in well over a thousand years

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.040
that those words
had been pronounced aloud.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.440
In that moment, he became a scholar.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is the future of the past.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.056
Thank you very much.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.080
(Applause)
