00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:16.986
I was excited to be a part
of the "Dream" theme,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.389
and then I found out I'm leading off
the "Nightmare?" section of it.

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.948
(Laughter)

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:28.438
And certainly there are things
about the climate crisis that qualify.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.725
And I have some bad news,

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.915
but I have a lot more good news.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.336
I'm going to propose three questions

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.100
and the answer to the first one

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.491
necessarily involves a little bad news.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:46.924
But -- hang on, because the answers
to the second and third questions

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:49.061
really are very positive.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.447
So the first question is,
"Do we really have to change?"

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:59.231
And of course, the Apollo Mission,
among other things

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.576
changed the environmental movement,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.432
really launched the modern
environmental movement.

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:08.913
18 months after this Earthrise picture
was first seen on earth,

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.537
the first Earth Day was organized.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.300
And we learned a lot about ourselves

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.214
looking back at our planet from space.

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:19.031
And one of the things that we learned

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.498
confirmed what the scientists
have long told us.

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:23.564
One of the most essential facts

00:01:23.588 --> 00:01:26.408
about the climate crisis
has to do with the sky.

00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.208
As this picture illustrates,

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:31.273
the sky is not the vast
and limitless expanse

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:34.129
that appears when we look up
from the ground.

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:38.006
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.425
surrounding the planet.

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:45.645
That right now is the open sewer
for our industrial civilization

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.549
as it's currently organized.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:51.195
We are spewing 110 million tons

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.187
of heat-trapping global warming pollution
into it every 24 hours,

00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:57.767
free of charge, go ahead.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.028
And there are many sources
of the greenhouse gases,

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.292
I'm certainly not going
to go through them all.

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:05.010
I'm going to focus on the main one,

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:09.422
but agriculture is involved,
diet is involved, population is involved.

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.929
Management of forests, transportation,

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:14.021
the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:16.864
But I'm going to focus
on the heart of the problem,

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:21.403
which is the fact that we still rely
on dirty, carbon-based fuels

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:27.866
for 85 percent of all the energy
that our world burns every year.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.566
And you can see from this image
that after World War II,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.498
the emission rates
started really accelerating.

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:37.851
And the accumulated amount
of man-made, global warming pollution

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.401
that is up in the atmosphere now

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.159
traps as much extra heat energy
as would be released

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:48.632
by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
atomic bombs exploding

00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:51.669
every 24 hours, 365 days a year.

00:02:52.494 --> 00:02:54.312
Fact-checked over and over again,

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.533
conservative, it's the truth.

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:58.653
Now it's a big planet, but --

00:02:59.131 --> 00:03:01.132
(Explosion sound)

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.779
that is a lot of energy,

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:08.206
particularly when you multiply it
400,000 times per day.

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.390
And all that extra heat energy

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:13.390
is heating up the atmosphere,
the whole earth system.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:15.364
Let's look at the atmosphere.

00:03:15.388 --> 00:03:16.678
This is a depiction

00:03:16.702 --> 00:03:22.167
of what we used to think of as
the normal distribution of temperatures.

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:25.278
The white represents
normal temperature days;

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:28.343
1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.247
The blue are cooler than average days,

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:32.522
the red are warmer than average days.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:36.704
But the entire curve has moved
to the right in the 1980s.

00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.879
And you'll see
in the lower right-hand corner

00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:41.346
the appearance of statistically
significant numbers

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.948
of extremely hot days.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.945
In the 90s, the curve shifted further.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.660
And in the last 10 years,
you see the extremely hot days

00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:52.351
are now more numerous
than the cooler than average days.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:57.831
In fact, they are 150 times more common
on the surface of the earth

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:01.236
than they were just 30 years ago.

00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:04.783
So we're having
record-breaking temperatures.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:08.130
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years
ever measured with instruments

00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:09.693
have been in this young century.

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.250
The hottest of all was last year.

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:15.771
Last month was the 371st month in a row

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:17.962
warmer than the 20th-century average.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:21.166
And for the first time,
not only the warmest January,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.251
but for the first time, it was more
than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:28.357
than the average.

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:32.285
These higher temperatures
are having an effect on animals,

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.372
plants, people, ecosystems.

00:04:35.396 --> 00:04:40.318
But on a global basis, 93 percent
of all the extra heat energy

00:04:40.342 --> 00:04:41.758
is trapped in the oceans.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.323
And the scientists can measure
the heat buildup

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:45.616
much more precisely now

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.871
at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:49.935
the first few hundred meters.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:52.554
And this, too, is accelerating.

00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:54.207
It goes back more than a century.

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:58.618
And more than half of the increase
has been in the last 19 years.

00:04:58.642 --> 00:04:59.965
This has consequences.

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:01.532
The first order of consequence:

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:03.510
the ocean-based storms get stronger.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:05.986
Super Typhoon Haiyan
went over areas of the Pacific

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.329
five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
warmer than normal

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.846
before it slammed into Tacloban,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.893
as the most destructive storm
ever to make landfall.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:20.537
Pope Francis, who has made
such a difference to this whole issue,

00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.866
visited Tacloban right after that.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.469
Superstorm Sandy went over
areas of the Atlantic

00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:27.851
nine degrees warmer than normal

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:30.762
before slamming into
New York and New Jersey.

00:05:31.954 --> 00:05:35.122
The second order of consequences
are affecting all of us right now.

00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:40.877
The warmer oceans are evaporating
much more water vapor into the skies.

00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:44.731
Average humidity worldwide
has gone up four percent.

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.448
And it creates these atmospheric rivers.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.490
The Brazilian scientists
call them "flying rivers."

00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:55.257
And they funnel all of that
extra water vapor over the land

00:05:55.281 --> 00:06:00.543
where storm conditions trigger
these massive record-breaking downpours.

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:03.307
This is from Montana.

00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:05.654
Take a look at this storm last August.

00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:07.997
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.

00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:11.805
It literally splashes off the city.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:15.032
These downpours are really unusual.

00:06:15.056 --> 00:06:18.207
Last July in Houston, Texas,

00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.185
it rained for two days,
162 billion gallons.

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:25.272
That represents more than two days
of the full flow of Niagara Falls

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:26.541
in the middle of the city,

00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:28.468
which was, of course, paralyzed.

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:32.840
These record downpours are creating
historic floods and mudslides.

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:36.278
This one is from Chile last year.

00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:40.318
And you'll see that warehouse going by.

00:06:40.342 --> 00:06:42.946
There are oil tankers cars going by.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.906
This is from Spain last September,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.024
you could call this the running
of the cars and trucks, I guess.

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:52.693
Every night on the TV news now
is like a nature hike

00:06:52.717 --> 00:06:54.248
through the Book of Revelation.

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:56.966
(Laughter)

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.351
I mean, really.

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.702
The insurance industry
has certainly noticed,

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:03.946
the losses have been mounting up.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.568
They're not under any illusions
about what's happening.

00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:13.242
And the causality requires
a moment of discussion.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.580
We're used to thinking of linear cause
and linear effect --

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:17.755
one cause, one effect.

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.581
This is systemic causation.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.248
As the great Kevin Trenberth says,

00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:24.732
"All storms are different now.

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.995
There's so much extra energy
in the atmosphere,

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:28.684
there's so much extra water vapor.

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:31.701
Every storm is different now."

00:07:31.725 --> 00:07:36.066
So, the same extra heat pulls
the soil moisture out of the ground

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.500
and causes these deeper, longer,
more pervasive droughts

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:42.614
and many of them are underway right now.

00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:44.152
It dries out the vegetation

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:47.838
and causes more fires
in the western part of North America.

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:51.321
There's certainly been evidence
of that, a lot of them.

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:52.496
More lightning,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.302
as the heat energy builds up,
there's a considerable amount

00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:58.146
of additional lightning also.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:05.578
These climate-related disasters also have
geopolitical consequences

00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:07.412
and create instability.

00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:12.712
The climate-related historic drought
that started in Syria in 2006

00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:15.688
destroyed 60 percent
of the farms in Syria,

00:08:15.712 --> 00:08:18.053
killed 80 percent of the livestock,

00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:22.296
and drove 1.5 million climate refugees
into the cities of Syria,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.549
where they collided with another
1.5 million refugees

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.589
from the Iraq War.

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:32.210
And along with other factors,
that opened the gates of Hell

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:35.414
that people are trying to close now.

00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:37.852
The US Defense Department has long warned

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:40.174
of consequences from the climate crisis,

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:44.725
including refugees,
food and water shortages

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.629
and pandemic disease.

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:51.382
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases
from the tropics spread

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.666
to the higher latitudes;

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.308
the transportation revolution has had
a lot to do with this.

00:08:56.332 --> 00:08:59.997
But the changing conditions
change the latitudes and the areas

00:09:00.021 --> 00:09:03.854
where these microbial diseases
can become endemic

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:08.617
and change the range of the vectors,
like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.

00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.109
The Zika epidemic now --

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:14.050
we're better positioned in North America

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:18.764
because it's still a little too cool
and we have a better public health system.

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:23.088
But when women in some regions
of South and Central America

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:25.823
are advised not to get pregnant
for two years --

00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:29.120
that's something new,
that ought to get our attention.

00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:33.109
The Lancet, one of the two greatest
medical journals in the world,

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:37.363
last summer labeled this
a medical emergency now.

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:40.049
And there are many factors because of it.

00:09:40.073 --> 00:09:42.870
This is also connected
to the extinction crisis.

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:46.441
We're in danger of losing 50 percent
of all the living species on earth

00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:47.788
by the end of this century.

00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:50.574
And already, land-based plants and animals

00:09:50.598 --> 00:09:52.246
are now moving towards the poles

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.653
at an average rate of 15 feet per day.

00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.971
Speaking of the North Pole,

00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:03.265
last December 29, the same storm
that caused historic flooding

00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:04.938
in the American Midwest,

00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:07.145
raised temperatures at the North Pole

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.799
50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,

00:10:09.823 --> 00:10:12.261
causing the thawing of the North Pole

00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:16.897
in the middle of the long,
dark, winter, polar night.

00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:20.503
And when the land-based ice
of the Arctic melts,

00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:22.245
it raises sea level.

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:26.014
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph
from Svalbard illustrates this.

00:10:26.474 --> 00:10:28.434
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:30.464
and particularly, Antarctica.

00:10:30.488 --> 00:10:35.178
The 10 largest risk cities
for sea-level rise by population

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:37.941
are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.

00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:42.074
When you measure it by assets at risk,
number one is Miami:

00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:44.721
three and a half trillion dollars at risk.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.416
Number three: New York and Newark.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.736
I was in Miami last fall
during the supermoon,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.871
one of the highest high-tide days.

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:56.027
And there were fish from the ocean
swimming in some of the streets

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:58.202
of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale

00:10:58.226 --> 00:10:59.400
and Del Rey.

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:02.398
And this happens regularly
during the highest-tide tides now.

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:05.037
Not with rain -- they call it
"sunny-day flooding."

00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:09.612
It comes up through the storm sewers.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:14.000
And the Mayor of Miami
speaks for many when he says

00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:18.247
it is long past time this can be viewed
through a partisan lens.

00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:21.407
This is a crisis
that's getting worse day by day.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.752
We have to move beyond partisanship.

00:11:23.776 --> 00:11:27.038
And I want to take a moment
to honor these House Republicans --

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.116
(Applause)

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.973
who had the courage last fall

00:11:30.997 --> 00:11:35.431
to step out and take a political risk,

00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:38.194
by telling the truth
about the climate crisis.

00:11:38.218 --> 00:11:41.375
So the cost of the climate
crisis is mounting up,

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:45.067
there are many of these aspects
I haven't even mentioned.

00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:47.064
It's an enormous burden.

00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:48.652
I'll mention just one more,

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:53.403
because the World Economic Forum
last month in Davos,

00:11:53.427 --> 00:11:56.444
after their annual survey
of 750 economists,

00:11:56.468 --> 00:11:59.328
said the climate crisis is now
the number one risk

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.181
to the global economy.

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:02.523
So you get central bankers

00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:05.317
like Mark Carney, the head
of the UK Central Bank,

00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:09.377
saying the vast majority
of the carbon reserves are unburnable.

00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:11.147
Subprime carbon.

00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.462
I'm not going to remind you what happened
with subprime mortgages,

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:16.088
but it's the same thing.

00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:18.827
If you look at all of the carbon fuels
that were burned

00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.521
since the beginning
of the industrial revolution,

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:25.061
this is the quantity burned
in the last 16 years.

00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:28.664
Here are all the ones that are proven
and left on the books,

00:12:28.688 --> 00:12:30.476
28 trillion dollars.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.709
The International Energy Agency
says only this amount can be burned.

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:37.622
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:38.843
unburnable.

00:12:39.303 --> 00:12:41.536
Risk to the global economy.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.597
That's why divestment movement
makes practical sense

00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.201
and is not just a moral imperative.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:51.395
So the answer to the first question,
"Must we change?"

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:53.343
is yes, we have to change.

00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:55.119
Second question, "Can we change?"

00:12:55.143 --> 00:12:57.464
This is the exciting news!

00:12:57.488 --> 00:13:00.993
The best projections
in the world 16 years ago

00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:05.048
were that by 2010, the world
would be able to install

00:13:05.072 --> 00:13:07.239
30 gigawatts of wind capacity.

00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:12.254
We beat that mark
by 14 and a half times over.

00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:16.062
We see an exponential curve
for wind installations now.

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.661
We see the cost coming down dramatically.

00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.935
Some countries -- take Germany,
an industrial powerhouse

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:26.327
with a climate not that different
from Vancouver's, by the way --

00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:27.986
one day last December,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.448
got 81 percent of all its energy
from renewable resources,

00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:33.105
mainly solar and wind.

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:36.430
A lot of countries are getting
more than half on an average basis.

00:13:36.454 --> 00:13:37.612
More good news:

00:13:37.636 --> 00:13:40.659
energy storage,
from batteries particularly,

00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:42.277
is now beginning to take off

00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:46.094
because the cost has been
coming down very dramatically

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:47.891
to solve the intermittency problem.

00:13:47.915 --> 00:13:50.426
With solar, the news is even
more exciting!

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.799
The best projections 14 years ago
were that we would install

00:13:53.823 --> 00:13:56.370
one gigawatt per year by 2010.

00:13:56.394 --> 00:14:01.014
When 2010 came around,
we beat that mark by 17 times over.

00:14:01.038 --> 00:14:04.623
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.

00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:07.887
This year, we're on track
to beat it 68 times over.

00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:09.101
We're going to win this.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.859
We are going to prevail.

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:14.966
The exponential curve on solar
is even steeper and more dramatic.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.919
When I came to this stage 10 years ago,

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:18.338
this is where it was.

00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:22.448
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough

00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:25.661
in the emergence
of these exponential curves.

00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:28.909
(Applause)

00:14:28.933 --> 00:14:32.430
And the cost has come down
10 percent per year

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:33.753
for 30 years.

00:14:33.777 --> 00:14:36.075
And it's continuing to come down.

00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:38.745
Now, the business community
has certainly noticed this,

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:41.578
because it's crossing
the grid parity point.

00:14:41.602 --> 00:14:44.854
Cheaper solar penetration rates
are beginning to rise.

00:14:44.878 --> 00:14:48.394
Grid parity is understood
as that line, that threshold,

00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:52.292
below which renewable electricity
is cheaper than electricity

00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:54.534
from burning fossil fuels.

00:14:54.558 --> 00:14:57.251
That threshold is a little bit
like the difference

00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:01.385
between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:02.995
or zero and one Celsius.

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:05.043
It's a difference of more than one degree,

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:07.768
it's the difference between ice and water.

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:11.736
And it's the difference between markets
that are frozen up,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.292
and liquid flows of capital
into new opportunities for investment.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:19.921
This is the biggest
new business opportunity

00:15:19.945 --> 00:15:21.477
in the history of the world,

00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.649
and two-thirds of it
is in the private sector.

00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:28.109
We are seeing an explosion
of new investment.

00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:33.701
Starting in 2010, investments globally
in renewable electricity generation

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.258
surpassed fossils.

00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:37.698
The gap has been growing ever since.

00:15:37.722 --> 00:15:40.670
The projections for the future
are even more dramatic,

00:15:40.694 --> 00:15:44.293
even though fossil energy
is now still subsidized

00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:47.544
at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.

00:15:47.568 --> 00:15:51.658
And by the way, if you add
the projections for nuclear on here,

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:54.303
particularly if you assume
that the work many are doing

00:15:54.327 --> 00:15:57.041
to try to break through to safer
and more acceptable,

00:15:57.065 --> 00:15:58.904
more affordable forms of nuclear,

00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:01.371
this could change even more dramatically.

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:04.890
So is there any precedent
for such a rapid adoption

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:06.643
of a new technology?

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:09.127
Well, there are many,
but let's look at cell phones.

00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:12.524
In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,

00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:14.941
commissioned McKinsey to do
a global market survey

00:16:14.965 --> 00:16:18.581
of those clunky new mobile phones
that appeared then.

00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:21.768
"How many can we sell
by the year 2000?" they asked.

00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:24.360
McKinsey came back and said, "900,000."

00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:26.456
And sure enough,
when the year 2000 arrived,

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.058
they did sell 900,000 --
in the first three days.

00:16:29.082 --> 00:16:32.994
And for the balance of the year,
they sold 120 times more.

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:37.394
And now there are more cell connections
than there are people in the world.

00:16:37.418 --> 00:16:41.887
So, why were they not only wrong,
but way wrong?

00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:44.311
I've asked that question myself, "Why?"

00:16:44.335 --> 00:16:45.338
(Laughter)

00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:47.595
And I think the answer is in three parts.

00:16:48.122 --> 00:16:51.511
First, the cost came down much faster
than anybody expected,

00:16:51.535 --> 00:16:54.042
even as the quality went up.

00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:58.338
And low-income countries, places
that did not have a landline grid --

00:16:58.362 --> 00:17:00.590
they leap-frogged to the new technology.

00:17:00.614 --> 00:17:03.678
The big expansion has been
in the developing counties.

00:17:03.702 --> 00:17:07.450
So what about the electricity grids
in the developing world?

00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:09.204
Well, not so hot.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.526
And in many areas, they don't exist.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.696
There are more people
without any electricity at all in India

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.842
than the entire population
of the United States of America.

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.370
So now we're getting this:

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:21.232
solar panels on grass huts

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:24.194
and new business models
that make it affordable.

00:17:24.218 --> 00:17:29.103
Muhammad Yunus financed
this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.

00:17:29.127 --> 00:17:30.835
This is a village market.

00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:33.749
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying
country in the world:

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:36.185
two systems per minute
on average, night and day.

00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:37.398
And we have all we need:

00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:39.714
enough energy from the Sun
comes to the earth

00:17:39.738 --> 00:17:45.101
every hour to supply the full world's
energy needs for an entire year.

00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.298
It's actually a little bit
less than an hour.

00:17:47.322 --> 00:17:50.654
So the answer to the second question,
"Can we change?"

00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:52.601
is clearly "Yes."

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.397
And it's an ever-firmer "yes."

00:17:55.421 --> 00:17:58.029
Last question, "Will we change?"

00:17:58.053 --> 00:18:00.045
Paris really was a breakthrough,

00:18:00.069 --> 00:18:01.732
some of the provisions are binding

00:18:01.756 --> 00:18:03.794
and the regular reviews will matter a lot.

00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:06.069
But nations aren't waiting,
they're going ahead.

00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:08.608
China has already announced
that starting next year,

00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:11.615
they're adopting a nationwide
cap and trade system.

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:14.782
They will likely link up
with the European Union.

00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:17.298
The United States
has already been changing.

00:18:17.322 --> 00:18:19.372
All of these coal plants were proposed

00:18:19.396 --> 00:18:21.926
in the next 10 years and canceled.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.869
All of these existing
coal plants were retired.

00:18:24.893 --> 00:18:27.910
All of these coal plants have had
their retirement announced.

00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:30.262
All of them -- canceled.

00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:31.776
We are moving forward.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.268
Last year -- if you look at
all of the investment

00:18:34.292 --> 00:18:37.235
in new electricity generation
in the United States,

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:39.925
almost three-quarters
was from renewable energy,

00:18:39.949 --> 00:18:42.461
mostly wind and solar.

00:18:42.485 --> 00:18:45.632
We are solving this crisis.

00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:50.555
The only question is:
how long will it take to get there?

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:55.196
So, it matters that a lot
of people are organizing

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.358
to insist on this change.

00:18:57.382 --> 00:19:01.166
Almost 400,000 people
marched in New York City

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.037
before the UN special session on this.

00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:06.065
Many thousands, tens of thousands,

00:19:06.089 --> 00:19:08.962
marched in cities around the world.

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:13.129
And so, I am extremely optimistic.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.708
As I said before,
we are going to win this.

00:19:15.732 --> 00:19:17.699
I'll finish with this story.

00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:20.810
When I was 13 years old,

00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:24.265
I heard that proposal by President Kennedy

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.840
to land a person on the Moon
and bring him back safely

00:19:26.864 --> 00:19:28.029
in 10 years.

00:19:28.053 --> 00:19:31.037
And I heard adults
of that day and time say,

00:19:31.061 --> 00:19:34.578
"That's reckless, expensive,
may well fail."

00:19:34.602 --> 00:19:36.779
But eight years and two months later,

00:19:36.803 --> 00:19:40.065
in the moment that Neil Armstrong
set foot on the Moon,

00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:44.679
there was great cheer that went up
in NASA's mission control in Houston.

00:19:44.703 --> 00:19:47.163
Here's a little-known fact about that:

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.392
the average age of the systems engineers,

00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:52.592
the controllers in the room
that day, was 26,

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:54.175
which means, among other things,

00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:57.449
their age, when they heard
that challenge, was 18.

00:19:57.473 --> 00:20:00.675
We now have a moral challenge

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:04.229
that is in the tradition of others
that we have faced.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:07.907
One of the greatest poets
of the last century in the US,

00:20:07.931 --> 00:20:09.280
Wallace Stevens,

00:20:09.304 --> 00:20:11.122
wrote a line that has stayed with me:

00:20:11.146 --> 00:20:13.629
"After the final 'no,'
there comes a 'yes,'

00:20:13.653 --> 00:20:16.634
and on that 'yes',
the future world depends."

00:20:16.658 --> 00:20:18.943
When the abolitionists
started their movement,

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.174
they met with no after no after no.

00:20:21.198 --> 00:20:22.474
And then came a yes.

00:20:22.498 --> 00:20:24.887
The Women's Suffrage
and Women's Rights Movement

00:20:24.911 --> 00:20:28.506
met endless no's, until finally,
there was a yes.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.301
The Civil Rights Movement,
the movement against apartheid,

00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:34.916
and more recently, the movement
for gay and lesbian rights

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.345
here in the United States and elsewhere.

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.545
After the final "no" comes a "yes."

00:20:39.569 --> 00:20:44.702
When any great moral challenge
is ultimately resolved

00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:48.581
into a binary choice
between what is right and what is wrong,

00:20:48.605 --> 00:20:52.734
the outcome is fore-ordained
because of who we are as human beings.

00:20:52.758 --> 00:20:56.611
Ninety-nine percent of us,
that is where we are now

00:20:56.635 --> 00:20:59.127
and it is why we're going to win this.

00:20:59.151 --> 00:21:01.089
We have everything we need.

00:21:01.113 --> 00:21:04.528
Some still doubt that we have
the will to act,

00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:09.242
but I say the will to act is itself
a renewable resource.

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:10.473
Thank you very much.

00:21:10.497 --> 00:21:13.968
(Applause)

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:50.502
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible
combination of skills.

00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:53.487
You've got this scientist mind
that can understand

00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:55.812
the full range of issues,

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:59.488
and the ability to turn it
into the most vivid language.

00:21:59.512 --> 00:22:02.395
No one else can do that,
that's why you led this thing.

00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:05.830
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago,
it was amazing to see it now.

00:22:05.854 --> 00:22:08.029
Al Gore: Well, you're nice
to say that, Chris.

00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:11.214
But honestly, I have a lot
of really good friends

00:22:11.238 --> 00:22:14.957
in the scientific community
who are incredibly patient

00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:17.752
and who will sit there
and explain this stuff to me

00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:19.110
over and over and over again

00:22:19.134 --> 00:22:22.730
until I can get it
into simple enough language

00:22:22.754 --> 00:22:23.966
that I can understand it.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.918
And that's the key to trying
to communicate.

00:22:27.497 --> 00:22:31.182
CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,

00:22:31.206 --> 00:22:33.143
second part: incredibly hopeful.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:39.111
How do we know that all those graphs,
all that progress, is enough

00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:41.863
to solve what you showed
in the first part?

00:22:41.887 --> 00:22:45.415
AG: I think that the crossing --

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:48.452
you know, I've only been
in the business world for 15 years.

00:22:48.476 --> 00:22:51.754
But one of the things I've learned
is that apparently it matters

00:22:51.778 --> 00:22:54.942
if a new product or service
is more expensive

00:22:54.966 --> 00:22:57.120
than the incumbent, or cheaper than.

00:22:57.144 --> 00:22:59.699
Turns out, it makes a difference
if it's cheaper than.

00:22:59.723 --> 00:23:00.818
(Laughter)

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:03.536
And when it crosses that line,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.456
then a lot of things really change.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.425
We are regularly surprised
by these developments.

00:23:08.449 --> 00:23:10.996
The late Rudi Dornbusch,
the great economist said,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.816
"Things take longer to happen
then you think they will,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.798
and then they happen much faster
than you thought they could."

00:23:16.822 --> 00:23:18.520
I really think that's where we are.

00:23:18.544 --> 00:23:22.221
Some people are using the phrase
"The Solar Singularity" now,

00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:25.538
meaning when it gets
below the grid parity,

00:23:25.562 --> 00:23:27.610
unsubsidized in most places,

00:23:27.634 --> 00:23:29.276
then it's the default choice.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.290
Now, in one of the presentations
yesterday, the jitney thing,

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:40.421
there is an effort to use
regulations to slow this down.

00:23:40.445 --> 00:23:43.584
And I just don't think it's going to work.

00:23:44.608 --> 00:23:47.004
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,

00:23:47.028 --> 00:23:49.109
who's the Chairman
of the Atlanta Tea Party.

00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:51.310
They enlisted her
in this effort to put a tax

00:23:51.334 --> 00:23:53.457
on solar panels and regulations.

00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.600
And she had just put
solar panels on her roof

00:23:55.624 --> 00:23:57.490
and she didn't understand the request.

00:23:57.514 --> 00:23:59.279
(Laughter)

00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:02.781
And so she went and formed
an alliance with the Sierra Club

00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:06.858
and they formed a new organization
called the Green Tea Party.

00:24:06.882 --> 00:24:07.884
(Laughter)

00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:08.909
(Applause)

00:24:08.933 --> 00:24:10.421
And they defeated the proposal.

00:24:10.445 --> 00:24:13.671
So, finally, the answer
to your question is,

00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:16.728
this sounds a little corny
and maybe it's a cliché,

00:24:16.752 --> 00:24:20.268
but 10 years ago -- and Christiana
referred to this --

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:26.199
there are people in this audience
who played an incredibly significant role

00:24:26.223 --> 00:24:29.024
in generating those exponential curves.

00:24:29.048 --> 00:24:31.572
And it didn't work out economically
for some of them,

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.650
but it kick-started
this global revolution.

00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:38.453
And what people in this audience do now

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.982
with the knowledge
that we are going to win this.

00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:45.236
But it matters a lot how fast we win it.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.617
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.

00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:49.316
If this turns out to be the year,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.168
that the partisan thing changes,

00:24:52.192 --> 00:24:55.570
as you said, it's no longer
a partisan issue,

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:59.760
but you bring along people
from the other side together,

00:24:59.784 --> 00:25:03.069
backed by science, backed by these kinds
of investment opportunities,

00:25:03.093 --> 00:25:05.201
backed by reason that you win the day --

00:25:05.225 --> 00:25:07.584
boy, that's really exciting.

00:25:07.608 --> 00:25:08.776
Thank you so much.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.307
AG: Thank you so much
for bringing me back to TED.

00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:12.482
Thank you!

00:25:12.506 --> 00:25:15.112
(Applause)
