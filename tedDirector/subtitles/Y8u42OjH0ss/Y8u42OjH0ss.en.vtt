00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.706
Every year in the United States alone,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.222
2,077,000 couples make
a legal and spiritual decision

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:28.476
to spend the rest
of their lives together --

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:30.292
(Laughter)

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:33.744
And not to have sex with anyone else.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.974
Ever.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.075
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.476
They go shopping for all sorts of things.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.015
She takes him to Arthur Murray
for ballroom-dancing lessons.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.480
And the big day comes.

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:53.404
And they'll stand before God and family

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.368
and some guy her dad
once did business with,

00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:58.977
and they'll vow that nothing --

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.281
not abject poverty,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:03.429
not life-threatening illness,

00:01:03.453 --> 00:01:06.865
not complete and utter misery --

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:12.219
will ever put the tiniest damper
on their eternal love and devotion.

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:13.991
(Laughter)

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:18.301
These optimistic young bastards
promise to honor and cherish each other

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:22.128
through hot flashes and midlife crises

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:25.592
and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:32.583
until that far-off day, when one of them
is finally able to rest in peace.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:33.825
(Laughter)

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:36.444
You know, because they can't hear
the snoring anymore.

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:38.591
And then they'll get stupid drunk

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.719
and smash cake in each other's faces
and do the Macarena.

00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:43.346
And we'll be there,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.780
showering them with towels and toasters
and drinking their free booze

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:51.165
and throwing birdseed at them
every single time ...

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:55.664
even though we know, statistically,

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:58.783
half of them will be divorced
within a decade.

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.458
(Laughter)

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:04.069
Of course, the other half won't, right?

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:07.068
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:09.580
and arguing about where to spend holidays

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:10.767
and debating --

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.859
(Laughter)

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:15.313
Which way the toilet paper
should come off of the roll.

00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:21.537
And some of them will even still
be enjoying each other's company

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:24.372
when neither of them can chew
solid food anymore.

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.905
And researchers want to know why.

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.437
I mean, look -- it doesn't take
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.396
to figure out what makes
a marriage not work:

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.877
disrespect, boredom,

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:39.389
too much time on Facebook,

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:41.429
having sex with other people.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.963
But you can have the exact
opposite of all of those things --

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:47.731
respect, excitement,

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:49.926
a broken Internet connection,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.046
mind-numbing monogamy --

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.563
and the thing still can go
to hell in a handbasket.

00:02:56.983 --> 00:02:59.517
So, what's going on when it doesn't?

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.490
What do the folks who make it all the way
to side-by-side burial plots

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:06.077
have in common?

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.811
What are they doing right?

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.061
What can we learn from them?

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.518
And if you're still happily sleeping solo,

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:18.954
why should you stop what you're doing
and make it your life's work

00:03:18.978 --> 00:03:21.671
to find that one special person

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:24.236
that you can annoy
for the rest of your life?

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.049
Well, researchers spend
billions of your tax dollars

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:29.909
trying to figure that out.

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:31.900
They stalk blissful couples

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:35.126
and study their every move and mannerism.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.938
And they try to pinpoint
what it is that sets them apart

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:41.205
from their miserable
neighbors and friends.

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:46.935
And it turns out, the success stories
share a few similarities,

00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:49.641
beyond that they don't have sex
with other people.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:53.213
For instance, in the happiest marriages,

00:03:53.237 --> 00:03:55.075
the wife is thinner and better-looking

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.265
than the husband.

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.379
(Laughter)

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.620
Obvious. Right?

00:03:59.644 --> 00:04:02.156
It's obvious that this leads
to marital bliss,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.833
because women -- we care a great deal
about being thin and good-looking,

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:08.236
whereas men mostly care about sex,

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.894
ideally, with women who are thinner
and better looking than they are.

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:15.248
The beauty of this research, though,

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:18.748
is that no one is suggesting
that women have to be thin to be happy.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.959
We just have to be thinner
than our partners.

00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:26.483
So instead of all that laborious
dieting and exercising,

00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.714
we just need to wait
for them to get fat --

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:30.010
(Laughter)

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:31.908
Maybe bake a few pies.

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:35.285
This is good information to have,
and it's not that complicated.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:36.335
(Laughter)

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.471
Research also suggests

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:43.686
that the happiest couples are the ones
that focus on the positives.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.274
For example: the happy wife.

00:04:45.298 --> 00:04:47.640
Instead of pointing out
her husband's growing gut

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:50.225
or suggesting he go for a run,

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.594
she might say,

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:54.902
"Wow, honey, thank you
for going out of your way

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:56.793
to make me relatively thinner."

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:57.821
(Laughter)

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:01.030
These are couples
who can find good in any situation.

00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:05.056
"Yeah, it was devastating
when we lost everything in that fire.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.105
But it's kind of nice sleeping
out here under the stars.

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.331
And it's a good thing you've got
all that body fat to keep us warm."

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:13.558
(Laughter)

00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:15.480
One of my favorite studies found

00:05:15.504 --> 00:05:18.631
that the more willing
a husband is to do housework,

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.937
the more attractive
his wife will find him.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.659
Because we needed a study to tell us this.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:25.955
(Laughter)

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.515
But here's what's going on here.

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.679
The more attractive she finds him,
the more sex they have;

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:33.125
the more sex they have,
the nicer he is to her;

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:34.849
the nicer he is to her,

00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:37.683
the less she nags him
about leaving wet towels on the bed,

00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:40.384
and ultimately,
they live happily ever after.

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.195
In other words, men,
you might want to pick it up a notch

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.741
in the domestic department.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.249
Here's an interesting one.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:53.682
One study found that people
who smile in childhood photographs

00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:55.598
are less likely to get a divorce.

00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:59.685
This is an actual study,
and let me clarify:

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.990
the researchers were not looking
at documented self-reports

00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:04.294
of childhood happiness,

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:06.346
or even studying old journals.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.941
The data were based entirely
on whether people looked happy

00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:12.259
in these early pictures.

00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:17.547
Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
but when I was a kid,

00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.285
your parents took pictures
with a special kind of camera

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.162
that held something called "film."

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.611
And, by God, film was expensive.

00:06:26.764 --> 00:06:31.544
They didn't take 300 shots of you
in that rapid-fire digital video mode

00:06:31.568 --> 00:06:35.300
and then pick out the nicest,
smiliest one for the Christmas card.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.381
Oh, no.

00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:40.269
They dressed you up, they lined you up,

00:06:40.293 --> 00:06:43.090
and you smiled for the fucking camera
like they told you to

00:06:43.114 --> 00:06:45.299
or you could kiss
your birthday party goodbye.

00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:48.867
But still, I have a huge pile
of fake happy childhood pictures

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.845
and I'm glad they make me less likely
than some people to get a divorce.

00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:57.090
So, what else can you do
to safeguard your marriage?

00:06:57.783 --> 00:07:01.030
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:02.871
(Laughter)

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:04.089
I'm serious.

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:07.155
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,
Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:09.365
Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon --

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.921
all of them single,
soon after taking home that statue.

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:15.311
They actually call it the Oscar curse.

00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:18.917
It is the marriage kiss of death
and something that should be avoided.

00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:24.000
And it's not just successfully
starring in films that's dangerous.

00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:27.931
It turns out, merely watching
a romantic comedy

00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:31.074
causes relationship
satisfaction to plummet.

00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:32.548
(Laughter)

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:38.441
Apparently, the bitter realization
that maybe it could happen to us,

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:41.077
but it obviously hasn't
and it probably never will,

00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:44.705
makes our lives seem
unbearably grim in comparison.

00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:46.498
And theoretically,

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:49.787
I suppose if we opt for a film
where someone gets brutally murdered

00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:52.209
or dies in a fiery car crash,

00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:54.377
we are more likely to walk out
of that theater

00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:56.339
feeling like we've got it pretty good.

00:07:56.363 --> 00:07:57.923
(Laughter)

00:07:58.432 --> 00:08:02.627
Drinking alcohol, it seems,
is bad for your marriage.

00:08:03.702 --> 00:08:04.874
Yeah.

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:07.484
I can't tell you anymore about that one

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:09.623
because I stopped reading it
at the headline.

00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:12.985
But here's a scary one:
divorce is contagious.

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:16.745
That's right, when you have
a close couple friend split up,

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:21.271
it increases your chances
of getting a divorce by 75 percent.

00:08:22.283 --> 00:08:24.991
Now, I have to say,
I don't get this one at all.

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:30.133
My husband and I have watched
quite a few friends divide their assets

00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:34.771
and then struggle
with being our age and single

00:08:34.795 --> 00:08:39.107
in an age of sexting
and Viagra and eHarmony.

00:08:39.622 --> 00:08:42.020
And I'm thinking they've done
more for my marriage

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.194
than a lifetime of therapy ever could.

00:08:45.054 --> 00:08:49.747
So now you may be wondering:
Why does anyone get married ever?

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:55.889
Well, the US federal government
counts more than a thousand legal benefits

00:08:55.913 --> 00:08:57.274
to being someone's spouse.

00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:00.443
A list that includes
visitation rights in jail,

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.721
but hopefully, you'll never need that one.

00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:06.033
But beyond the profound federal perks,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.773
married people make more money.

00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:12.793
We're healthier,
physically and emotionally.

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:18.039
We produce happier, more stable
and more successful kids.

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:23.281
We have more sex than our supposedly
swinging single friends,

00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:24.497
believe it or not.

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:26.236
We even live longer,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.415
which is a pretty compelling argument
for marrying someone you like a lot

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:32.663
in the first place.

00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:33.696
(Laughter)

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.700
Now, if you're not currently experiencing
the joy of the joint tax return,

00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:43.218
I can't tell you how to find
a chore-loving person

00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:45.645
of the approximately ideal size
and attractiveness,

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:46.947
who prefers horror movies

00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:50.136
and doesn't have a lot of friends
hovering on the brink of divorce,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.236
but I can only encourage you to try,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.104
because the benefits, as I've pointed out,

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.278
are significant.

00:09:57.188 --> 00:10:00.434
The bottom line is: whether you're in it
or you're searching for it,

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:04.867
I believe marriage is an institution
worth pursuing and protecting.

00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:08.393
So I hope you'll use the information
I've given you today

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:11.445
to weigh your personal strengths
against your own risk factors.

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:15.644
For instance, in my marriage,
I'd say I'm doing OK.

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:17.986
One the one hand,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.070
I have a husband who's annoyingly lean
and incredibly handsome.

00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:24.830
So I'm obviously going
to need fatten him up.

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:28.109
And like I said, we have
those divorced friends

00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:31.494
who may secretly or subconsciously
be trying to break us up.

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:34.111
So we have to keep an eye on that.

00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:37.354
And we do like a cocktail or two.

00:10:38.108 --> 00:10:39.497
On the other hand,

00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:41.764
I have the fake happy picture thing.

00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:45.403
And also, my husband does
a lot around the house,

00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:49.022
and would happily never see
another romantic comedy

00:10:49.046 --> 00:10:50.292
as long as he lives.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.541
So I've got all those things going for me.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.138
But just in case,

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:59.535
I plan to work extra hard
to not win an Oscar anytime soon.

00:10:59.896 --> 00:11:01.964
And for the good of your relationships,

00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:03.914
I would encourage you to do the same.

00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:06.137
I'll see you at the bar.

00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:07.332
(Laughter)

00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:10.236
(Applause)
