00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hi, my name is Marcin --

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
farmer, technologist.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
We've identified the 50 most important machines

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
things from tractors,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
bread ovens, circuit makers.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Then we set out to create

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
an open source, DIY, do it yourself version

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that anyone can build and maintain

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
at a fraction of the cost.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
So let me tell you a story.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So I finished my 20s

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and I discovered I was useless.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I had no practical skills.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The world presented me with options,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and I took them.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
So I started a farm in Missouri

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and learned about the economics of farming.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I paid to get it repaired --

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
then it broke again.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Then pretty soon,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I was broke too.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I realized

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
to start a sustainable farm and settlement

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
just didn't exist yet.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I needed tools that were robust, modular,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
highly efficient and optimized,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
low-cost,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
not designed for obsolescence.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I found that I would have to build them myself.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So I did just that.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And I tested them.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And I found that industrial productivity

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
can be achieved on a small scale.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So then I published the 3D designs,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
schematics,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
instructional videos and budgets

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
on a wiki.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Then contributors from all over the world

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
began showing up, prototyping new machines

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
during dedicated project visits.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And now the project

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
is beginning to grow on its own.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
We know that open source has succeeded

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
We're focusing on hardware

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because it is hardware that can change people's lives

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
in such tangible material ways.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
That's not only in the developing world.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Our tools are being made

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
We've seen lots of excitement from these people,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
who can now start a construction business,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
parts manufacturing,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
organic CSA

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
or just selling power back to the grid.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Our goal is a repository of published designs

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
so clear, so complete,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that a single burned DVD

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is effectively a civilization starter kit.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
from the dirt beneath my feet

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and built a tractor in six days.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
If this idea is truly sound,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
then the implications are significant.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
A greater distribution of the means of production,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
environmentally sound supply chains,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and a newly relevant DIY maker culture

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
can hope to transcend

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
artificial scarcity.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
We're exploring the limits

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
of what we all can do to make a better world

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
with open hardware technology.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Thank you.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
(Applause)
