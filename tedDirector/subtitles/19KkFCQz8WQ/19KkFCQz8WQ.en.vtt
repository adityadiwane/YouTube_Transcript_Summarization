00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I want to share with you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
over the next 18 minutes

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a pretty incredible idea.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Actually, it's a really big idea.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
But to get us started,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I want to ask if everyone

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
could just close your eyes for two seconds

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and try and think of a technology or a bit of science

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that you think has changed the world.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Now I bet, in this audience,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
you're thinking of some really incredible technology,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
some stuff that I haven't even heard of,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I'm absolutely sure.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But I'm also sure, pretty sure,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
This is a polio vaccine.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And it's a great thing actually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that nobody's had to think about it here today

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
because it means that we can take this for granted.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
This is a great technology.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
We can take it completely for granted.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But it wasn't always that way.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Even here in California,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
if we were to go back just a few years,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
it was a very different story.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
People were terrified of this disease.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And it was because of scenes like this.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
In this scene,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
people are living in an iron lung.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and then two days later,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
they can no longer breathe,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and this polio virus has paralyzed

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
not only their arms and their legs,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
but also their breathing muscles.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
in this iron lung to breathe for them.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
This disease was terrifying.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
There was no cure,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and there was no vaccine.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
The disease was so terrifying

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that the president of the United States

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
launched an extraordinary national effort

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
to find a way to stop it.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Twenty years later, they succeeded

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and developed the polio vaccine.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
It was hailed as a scientific miracle

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
in the late 1950s.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and here in the United States

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
it had an incredible impact.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
As you can see, the virus stopped,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and it stopped very, very fast.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
But this wasn't the case

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
everywhere in the world.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And it happened so fast in the United States, however,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that even just last month Jon Stewart said this:

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
(Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Because I thought that had been eradicated

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
But the reality is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that polio still exists today.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
This is the picture.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
There's not very much left in the world.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But the reason there's not very much left

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
working behind the scenes, almost unknown,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I'm sure to most of you here today.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It's been working for 20 years

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
to try and eradicate this disease,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and it's got it down to these few cases

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that you can see here on this graphic.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
But just last year,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
we had an incredible shock

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and realized that almost just isn't good enough

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
with a virus like polio.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And this is the reason:

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
in two countries

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
on opposite sides of the globe,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Hundreds of people died --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
children as well as adults.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And in both cases,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
They had come from thousands of miles away.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And in one case, it originated on another continent.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And not only that, but when they came into these countries,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
then they got on commercial jetliners probably

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and they traveled even farther

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
to other places like Russia,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
where, for the first time in over a decade last year,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
children were crippled and paralyzed

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
by a disease that they had not seen for years.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
these are under control now,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
But the message was very clear.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Polio is still

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
a devastating, explosive disease.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260
It's just happening in another part of the world.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And our big idea

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
is that the scientific miracle of this decade

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
should be the complete eradication

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
of poliomyelitis.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So I want to tell you a little bit

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is trying to do.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
We're not trying to control polio.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because this disease is like a root fire;

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
So what we're looking for

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is a permanent solution.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
can take for granted

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
a polio-free world.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So we're looking for a permanent solution,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and this is where we get lucky.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
This is one of the very few viruses in the world

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
where there are big enough cracks in its armor

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
This virus can only survive in people.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It can't live for a very long time in people.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
So we are trying

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
to wipe out this virus completely.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
What the polio eradication program is trying to do

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
is to kill the virus itself

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that causes polio

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
everywhere on Earth.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Now we don't have a great track record

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
when it comes to doing something like this,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to eradicating diseases.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
It's been tried six times in the last century,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and it's been successful exactly once.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And this is because disease eradication,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
it's still the venture capital of public health.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
The risks are massive,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
but the pay-off --

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
economic, humanitarian, motivational --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
it's absolutely huge.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
One congressman here in the United States

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
thinks that the entire investment

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
pays itself off every 26 days --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
in foregone treatment costs

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and vaccination costs.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And if we can finish polio eradication,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
the poorest countries in the world

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.260
are going to save over 50 billion dollars

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
in the next 25 years alone.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But smallpox eradication was hard;

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
it was very, very hard.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and there's a few reasons for that.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
The first is that,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
when we started trying to eradicate polio

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
about 20 years ago,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
more than twice as many countries were infected

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
than had been when we started off with smallpox.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And there were more than 10 times as many people

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
living in these countries.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So it was a massive effort.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The second challenge we had was --

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life --

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
on every single vial

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
so that it will change very quickly

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
when it's exposed to too much heat,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But the third challenge we have --

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy --

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
every single person almost who was infected with smallpox

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
had this telltale rash.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
So you could get around the disease;

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
With polio it's almost completely different.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
show absolutely no sign of the disease.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So you can't see the enemy most of the time,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and as a result,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
than what was done with smallpox.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
We've had to create

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
one of the largest social movements in history.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
There's over 10 million people,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
probably 20 million people,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
largely volunteers,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
who have been working over the last 20 years

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
in what has now been called

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
These people, these 20 million people,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
vaccinate over 500 million children

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
every single year,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
multiple times

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
at the peak of our operation.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
It's just two drops, like that.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
But reaching 500 million people

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
is much, much tougher.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And these vaccinators, these volunteers,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
they have got to dive headlong

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
into some of the toughest, densest

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
urban slums in the world.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
They've got to trek under sweltering suns

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.260
to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And they also have to dodge bullets,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
because we have got to operate

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
during shaky cease-fires and truces

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
to try and vaccinate children,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
even in areas affected by conflict.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
One reporter

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
a place which has eradicated polio,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
He was sitting outside of the road,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
watching one of these polio campaigns unfold,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and a few months later he wrote:

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
"This is foreign aid at its most heroic."

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
all sorts of backgrounds.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
This is a group

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
whose million-strong army of volunteers

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
have been working to eradicate polio

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
for over 20 years.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
They're right at the center of the whole thing.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
for polio eradication --

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
more than 15 years, much longer than it should have --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
but once it was built, the results were striking.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Within a couple of years,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
every country that started polio eradication

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.260
rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
with the exception of four countries that you see here.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And then, by 1999,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
one of the three polio viruses

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
that we were trying to eradicate

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
had been completely eradicated worldwide --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
proof of concept.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And then today,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
there's been a 99 percent reduction --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
greater than 99 percent reduction --

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
in the number of children

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
When we started, over 20 years ago,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
1,000 children were being paralyzed

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
every single day by this virus.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
Last year, it was 1,000.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
And at the same time,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
the polio eradication program

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
has been working to help with a lot of other areas.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
It's been working to help control pandemic flu,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
SARS for example.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
It's also tried to save children by doing other things --

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
giving bed nets against malaria even

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
during some of these campaigns.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
But the most exciting thing

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
that the polio eradication program has been doing

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
has been to force us,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
the international community,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to reach every single child, every single community,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
the most vulnerable people in the world,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
with the most basic of health services,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
irrespective of geography, poverty,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
culture and even conflict.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
So things were looking very exciting,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and then about five years ago,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
The first problem we ran into

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.260
we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
And then to make the matters even worse,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
the virus started to spread out of these four places,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
especially northern India and northern Nigeria,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
causing horrific outbreaks

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
in places that had not seen this disease for decades.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And then,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
in one of the most important, tenacious

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
we found that our vaccine was working

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
half as well as it should have.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
In conditions like this,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
in the guts of these children

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and protect them the way that it needed to.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Now at that time,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
there was a great, as you can imagine,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
frustration -- let's call it frustration --

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
it started to grow very, very quickly.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And all of a sudden, some very important voices

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
in the world of public health

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
started to say, "Hang on.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
We should abandon this idea of eradication.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
it's a false premise.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
The brutal truth is,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
if we don't have the will or the skill,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
or even the money that we need

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
with something as simple

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
as an oral polio vaccine,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
then pretty soon,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
more than 200,000 children

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
are again going to be paralyzed by this disease

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
every single year.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
There's absolutely no question.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
These are children like Umar.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Umar is seven years old,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and he's from northern Nigeria.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
He lives in a family home there

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
with his eight brothers and sisters.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Umar also has polio.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Umar was paralyzed for life.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
His right leg was paralyzed

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
in 2004.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
This leg, his right leg,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
now takes an awful beating

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
because he has to half-crawl,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
because it's faster to move that way

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
than to get up on his crutches and walk.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
As you probably can't see the detail here,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
but this is his report card,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
He got 100 percent in all the important things,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
like nursery rhymes, for example there.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
but it's not true.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Umar is an exceptional kid

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
in exceptional circumstances.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
The reality of polio today

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
is something very different.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It leaves their children paralyzed,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and it drags their families

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
deeper into poverty,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
because they're desperately searching

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
trying in vain

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
to find a cure for their children.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
We think children deserve better.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And so when the going got really tough

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
in the polio eradication program

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
about two years ago,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
when people were saying, "We should call it off,"

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
the Polio Partnership

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
decided to buckle down once again

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
and try and find innovative new solutions,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
new ways to get to the children

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
that we were missing again and again.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
In northern India, we started mapping the cases

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
using satellite imaging like this,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
so we could get to the millions of children

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
on the Koshi River basin

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
where there are no other health services.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
In northern Nigeria,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
they got directly involved in the program

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
to help solve the problems of logistics

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and community confidence.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
And now they've even started using these devices --

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
speaking of cool technology --

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
these little devices, little GIS trackers like this,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
And then they can track them,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and at the end of the day, they look and see,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
did these guys get every single street, every single house.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches --

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
access negotiators.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
to ensure that we can reach every child.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
But as we tried these extraordinary things,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
as people went to this trouble

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
to try and rework their tactics,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine --

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
so that when they finally get to these kids,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
we can have a better bang for our buck.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and within six months,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
we were testing a new polio vaccine

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
that targeted, just two years ago,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
the last two types of polio in the world.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Now June the ninth, 2009,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and it turned out to be a game-changer.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
The new vaccine

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
as the old vaccine had,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
and we immediately started using this.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
And it started rolling off the production lines

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
and into the mouths of children around the world.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
And we didn't start with the easy places.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
The first place this vaccine was used

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
was in southern Afghanistan,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
because it's in places like that

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
where kids are going to benefit the most

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
from technologies like this.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.260
I've seen people challenging the audience again and again

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
to believe in the impossible.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
So this morning at about seven o'clock,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
I decided that we'd try to drive Chris

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and the production crew here berserk

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.260
by downloading all of our data from India again,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
so that you could see something

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
that's just unfolding today,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.260
which proves that the impossible is possible.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
when it comes to polio.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
Over 500,000 children

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
are born in the two states that have never stopped polio --

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar --

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
500,000 children every single month.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
Sanitation is terrible,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
and our old vaccine, you remember,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
worked half as well as it should have.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
And yet, the impossible is happening.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.260
Today marks exactly six months --

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
and for the first time in history,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
not a single child has been paralyzed

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:44.260
(Applause)

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
India's not unique.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
In Umar's home country of Nigeria,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
a 95 percent reduction

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
And in the last six months,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
we've had less places reinfected by polio

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
than at any other time in history.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
of smart people, smart technology

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
and smart investments,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.260
polio can now be eradicated anywhere.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
We have major challenges, you can imagine,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
to finish this job,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
but as you've also seen,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
it's doable,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
it has great secondary benefits,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
and polio eradication is a great buy.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
And as long as any child anywhere

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
is paralyzed by this virus,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
it's a stark reminder

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.260
that we are failing, as a society, to reach children

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
with the most basic of services.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
And for that reason, polio eradication:

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.260
it's the ultimate in equity

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.260
and it's the ultimate in social justice.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
The huge social movement

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
that's been involved in polio eradication

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.260
is ready to do way more for these children.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.260
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.260
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm,

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
capitalizing on their energy

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
means finishing the job

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.260
that they started 20 years ago.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.260
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
and it's the right thing to do.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
Now we're in tough times economically.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.260
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
said about a month ago when he was talking about polio,

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
"There's never a wrong time

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
to do the right thing."

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.260
Finishing polio eradication

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.260
is the right thing to do.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.260
And we are at a crossroads right now

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
in this great effort over the last 20 years.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
We have a new vaccine,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
we have new resolve,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
and we have new tactics.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.260
We have the chance

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.260
to write an entirely new polio-free chapter

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.260
in human history.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.260
But if we blink now,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
we will lose forever

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.260
the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.260
Here's a great idea to spread:

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.260
End polio now.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.260
Help us tell the story.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.260
Help us build the momentum

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.260
so that very soon

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.260
every child, every parent

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.260
everywhere

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.260
can also take for granted

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.260
a polio-free life forever.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.260
Thank you.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:38.260
(Applause)

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.260
Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.260
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.260
BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped --

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.260
northern Nigeria, northern India,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.260
the southern corner of Afghanistan

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
and bordering areas of Pakistan --

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.260
they're going to be the toughest.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
But the interesting thing is, of those three,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.260
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.260
has probably stopped polio repeatedly.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.260
It keeps getting reinfected.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.260
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.260
and getting Pakistan finished.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.260
They're going to be the tough ones.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.260
BG: Now what about the money?

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.260
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.260
And is it easy to raise that money?

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.260
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.260
BA: It's interesting.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.260
We spend right now about 750 million

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.260
to 800 million dollars a year.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.260
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.260
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.260
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times --

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.260
20, 30 cents to reach a child --

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.260
that's not very much money.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.260
But right now we don't have enough of that.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.260
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.260
and every time we cut corners,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.260
more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.260
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.260
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.260
and the governments will keep their generosity up.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.260
So good luck. We're all in this with you.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.260
Thank you. (BA: Thank you.)

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.260
(Applause)
