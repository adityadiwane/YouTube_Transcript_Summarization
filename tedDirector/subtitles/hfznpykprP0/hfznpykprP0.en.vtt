00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.992
Now, Hegel -- he very famously said

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.823
that Africa was a place without history,

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.935
without past, without narrative.

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:26.787
Yet, I'd argue that no other continent
has nurtured, has fought for,

00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:30.279
has celebrated its history
more concertedly.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:33.372
The struggle to keep
African narrative alive

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:35.487
has been one of the most consistent

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.420
and hard-fought endeavors
of African peoples,

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.417
and it continues to be so.

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.152
The struggles endured and the sacrifices
made to hold onto narrative

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:51.225
in the face of enslavement, colonialism,
racism, wars and so much else

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.260
has been the underpinning narrative

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:54.553
of our history.

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.595
And our narrative has not just
survived the assaults

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.414
that history has thrown at it.

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:04.160
We've left a body of material culture,

00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:08.077
artistic magistery
and intellectual output.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.737
We've mapped and we've charted
and we've captured our histories

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:16.543
in ways that are the measure
of anywhere else on earth.

00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:21.619
Long before the meaningful
arrival of Europeans --

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:25.183
indeed, whilst Europe was still
mired in its Dark Age --

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:30.591
Africans were pioneering techniques
in recording, in nurturing history,

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:36.060
forging revolutionary methods
for keeping their story alive.

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:39.785
And living history, dynamic heritage --

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:42.121
it remains important to us.

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:45.865
We see that manifest in so many ways.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:51.424
I'm reminded of how, just last year --
you might remember it --

00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:52.619
the first members

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:55.068
of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:58.314
were indicted for war crimes
and sent to the Hague.

00:01:58.338 --> 00:02:02.896
And one of the most notorious
was Ahmad al-Faqi,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.364
who was a young Malian,

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:06.514
and he was charged, not with genocide,

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:08.454
not with ethnic cleansing,

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:12.293
but with being one
of the instigators of a campaign

00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:16.738
to destroy some of Mali's most
important cultural heritage.

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.560
This wasn't vandalism;

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:20.781
these weren't thoughtless acts.

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.218
One of the things that al-Faqi said

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:26.175
when he was asked
to identify himself in court

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.062
was that he was a graduate,
that he was a teacher.

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:35.294
Over the course of 2012,
they engaged in a systematic campaign

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:38.557
to destroy Mali's cultural heritage.

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:43.467
This was a deeply considered waging of war

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.174
in the most powerful way
that could be envisaged:

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:49.560
in destroying narrative,
in destroying stories.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.573
The attempted destruction of nine shrines,

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:55.091
the central mosque

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:58.608
and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:00.975
was a considered act.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:07.081
They understood the power of narrative
to hold communities together,

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:11.323
and they conversely understood
that in destroying stories,

00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:14.262
they hoped they would destroy a people.

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:17.783
But just as Ansar Dine
and their insurgency

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:21.023
were driven by powerful narratives,

00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:25.404
so was the local population's defense
of Timbuktu and its libraries.

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:29.658
These were communities who've grown up
with stories of the Mali Empire;

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:32.843
lived in the shadow
of Timbuktu's great libraries.

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:36.724
They'd listened to songs
of its origin from their childhood,

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:39.490
and they weren't about to give up on that

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:41.096
without a fight.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.332
Over difficult months of 2012,

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.308
during the Ansar Dine invasion,

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:52.158
Malians, ordinary people,
risked their lives

00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:55.651
to secrete and smuggle
documents to safety,

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:59.934
doing what they could
to protect historic buildings

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.258
and defend their ancient libraries.

00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:04.936
And although they weren't
always successful,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.643
many of the most important manuscripts
were thankfully saved,

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:13.572
and today each one of the shrines
that was damaged during that uprising

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:15.388
have been rebuilt,

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:20.630
including the 14th-century mosque
that is the symbolic heart of the city.

00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:22.470
It's been fully restored.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:26.899
But even in the bleakest periods
of the occupation,

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:32.316
enough of the population of Timbuktu
simply would not bow

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.207
to men like al-Faqi.

00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:37.294
They wouldn't allow their history
to be wiped away,

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.585
and anyone who has visited
that part of the world,

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:42.437
they will understand why,

00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:47.594
why stories, why narrative, why histories
are of such importance.

00:04:47.618 --> 00:04:49.954
History matters.

00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:52.716
History really matters.

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.463
And for peoples of African descent,

00:04:55.487 --> 00:05:01.105
who have seen their narrative
systematically assaulted over centuries,

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.656
this is critically important.

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:08.179
This is part of a recurrent echo
across our history

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:13.510
of ordinary people making a stand
for their story, for their history.

00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:16.054
Just as in the 19th century,

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:20.047
enslaved peoples of African
descent in the Caribbean

00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:22.385
fought under threat of punishment,

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.560
fought to practice their religions,
to celebrate Carnival,

00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:29.319
to keep their history alive.

00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:33.223
Ordinary people were prepared
to make great sacrifices,

00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:36.473
some even the ultimate sacrifice,

00:05:36.497 --> 00:05:37.887
for their history.

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:41.410
And it was through control of narrative

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:45.770
that some of the most devastating
colonial campaigns were crystallized.

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:49.649
It was through the dominance
of one narrative over another

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:54.228
that the worst manifestations
of colonialism became palpable.

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:58.688
When, in 1874, the British
attacked the Ashanti,

00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:02.340
they overran Kumasi
and captured the Asantehene.

00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:07.137
They knew that controlling territory
and subjugating the head of state --

00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.718
it wasn't enough.

00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:12.266
They recognized that
the emotional authority of state

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.113
lay in its narrative

00:06:15.118 --> 00:06:17.680
and the symbols that represented it,

00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:19.066
like the Golden Stool.

00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:25.173
They understood that control of story
was absolutely critical

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:27.444
to truly controlling a people.

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:29.547
And the Ashanti understood, too,

00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.981
and they never were to relinquish
the precious Golden Stool,

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:38.590
never to completely
capitulate to the British.

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.633
Narrative matters.

00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:47.315
In 1871, Karl Mauch, a German geologist
working in Southern Africa,

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.396
he stumbled across
an extraordinary complex,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.146
a complex of abandoned stone buildings.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.486
And he never quite recovered
from what he saw:

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.743
a granite, drystone city,

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:04.568
stranded on an outcrop
above an empty savannah:

00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.320
Great Zimbabwe.

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:10.565
And Mauch had no idea who was responsible

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:15.655
for what was obviously
an astonishing feat of architecture,

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:19.222
but he felt sure of one single thing:

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:23.036
this narrative needed to be claimed.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.904
He later wrote that the wrought
architecture of Great Zimbabwe

00:07:26.928 --> 00:07:29.667
was simply too sophisticated,

00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:33.224
too special to have
been built by Africans.

00:07:33.248 --> 00:07:37.775
Mauch, like dozens of Europeans
that followed in his footsteps,

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.579
speculated on who
might have built the city.

00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:43.817
And one went as far as to posit,

00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:49.566
"I do not think that I am far wrong
if I suppose that that ruin on the hill

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.141
is a copy of King Solomon's Temple."

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:53.896
And as I'm sure you know, Mauch,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.864
he hadn't stumbled upon
King Solomon's Temple,

00:07:56.888 --> 00:08:00.434
but upon a purely African
complex of buildings

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:04.085
constructed by a purely
African civilization

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.065
from the 11th century onward.

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:10.240
But like Leo Frobenius,
a fellow German anthropologist

00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:12.609
who speculated some years later,

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:16.640
upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads
for the very first time,

00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:22.071
that they must have been artifacts
from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis.

00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:24.672
He felt, just like Hegel,

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:30.435
an almost instinctive need
to rob Africa of its history.

00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:33.622
These ideas are so irrational,

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.459
so deeply held,

00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:38.682
that even when faced
with the physical archaeology,

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:40.715
they couldn't think rationally.

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:42.737
They could no longer see.

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:46.942
And like so much of Africa's relationship
with Enlightenment Europe,

00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:52.749
it involved appropriation, denigration
and control of the continent.

00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:57.513
It involved an attempt
to bend narrative to Europe's ends.

00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:02.148
And if Mauch had really wanted
to find an answer to his question,

00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:06.826
"Where did Great Zimbabwe
or that great stone building come from?"

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.050
he would have needed to begin his quest

00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:11.763
a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe,

00:09:11.787 --> 00:09:15.606
at the eastern edge of the continent,
where Africa meets the Indian Ocean.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.838
He would have needed to trace
the gold and the goods

00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:23.677
from some of the great trading emporia
of the Swahili coast to Great Zimbabwe,

00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:27.160
to gain a sense of the scale and influence

00:09:27.184 --> 00:09:29.064
of that mysterious culture,

00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:34.270
to get a picture of Great Zimbabwe
as a political, cultural entity

00:09:34.294 --> 00:09:37.735
through the kingdoms and the civilizations

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:40.218
that were drawn under its control.

00:09:40.242 --> 00:09:45.277
For centuries, traders have been drawn
to that bit of the coast

00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:51.209
from as far away as India
and China and the Middle East.

00:09:51.233 --> 00:09:53.920
And it might be tempting to interpret,

00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:57.054
because it's exquisitely
beautiful, that building,

00:09:57.078 --> 00:10:00.066
it might be tempting to interpret it

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.618
as just an exquisite, symbolic jewel,

00:10:03.642 --> 00:10:06.530
a vast ceremonial sculpture in stone.

00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:10.179
But the site must have been a complex

00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:14.758
at the center of a significant
nexus of economies

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:17.863
that defined this region for a millennium.

00:10:18.395 --> 00:10:20.111
This matters.

00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:22.174
These narratives matter.

00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:27.239
Even today, the fight to tell our story
is not just against time.

00:10:27.263 --> 00:10:30.986
It's not just against
organizations like Ansar Dine.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.084
It's also in establishing
a truly African voice

00:10:35.108 --> 00:10:37.956
after centuries of imposed histories.

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:42.206
We don't just have
to recolonize our history,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.104
but we have to find ways to build back
the intellectual underpinning

00:10:47.128 --> 00:10:49.313
that Hegel denied was there at all.

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.586
We have to rediscover African philosophy,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.612
African perspectives, African history.

00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:01.161
The flowering of Great Zimbabwe --
it wasn't a freak moment.

00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:05.158
It was part of a burgeoning change
across the whole of the continent.

00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:09.508
Perhaps the great exemplification of that
was Sundiata Keita,

00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:11.725
the founder of the Mali Empire,

00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:15.689
probably the greatest empire
that West Africa has ever seen.

00:11:15.713 --> 00:11:18.811
Sundiata Keita was born about 1235,

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:22.292
growing up in a time of profound flux.

00:11:22.928 --> 00:11:26.776
He was seeing the transition
between the Berber dynasties to the north,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.070
he may have heard about the rise
of the Ife to the south

00:11:30.094 --> 00:11:35.211
and perhaps even the dominance
of the Solomaic Dynasty

00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:36.938
in Ethiopia to the east.

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:41.152
And he must have been aware
that he was living through a moment

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:42.871
of quickening change,

00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:45.655
of growing confidence in our continent.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.535
He must have been aware of new states

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.023
that were building their influence

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:57.315
from as far afield as Great Zimbabwe
and the Swahili sultanates,

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:03.586
each engaged directly or indirectly
beyond the continent itself,

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:09.040
each driven also to invest in securing
their intellectual and cultural legacy.

00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:13.222
He probably would have engaged
in trade with these peer nations

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:16.749
as part of a massive continental nexus

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:19.007
of great medieval African economies.

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:23.207
And like all of those great empires,

00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:28.832
Sundiata Keita invested in securing
his legacy through history

00:12:28.856 --> 00:12:30.458
by using story --

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:37.437
not just formalizing
the idea of storytelling,

00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:40.138
but in building a whole convention

00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:43.523
of telling and retelling his story

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:45.964
as a key to founding a narrative

00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:47.583
for his empire.

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:50.952
And these stories, in musical form,

00:12:50.976 --> 00:12:54.331
are still sung today.

00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:58.675
Now, several decades
after the death of Sundiata,

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:01.098
a new king ascended the throne,

00:13:01.122 --> 00:13:05.285
Mansa Musa, its most famous emperor.

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:08.466
Now, Mansa Musa is famed
for his vast gold reserves

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.507
and for sending envoys to the courts
of Europe and the Middle East.

00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:17.261
He was every bit as ambitious
as his predecessors,

00:13:17.285 --> 00:13:21.552
but saw a different kind of route
of securing his place in history.

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:25.583
In 1324, Mansa Musa
went on pilgrimage to Mecca,

00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:28.938
and he traveled
with a retinue of thousands.

00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:35.620
It's been said that 100 camels
each carried 100 pounds of gold.

00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:39.160
It's been recorded that he built
a fully functioning mosque

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.351
every Friday of his trip,

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:44.496
and performed so many acts of kindness,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.359
that the great Berber chronicler,
Ibn Battuta, wrote,

00:13:48.383 --> 00:13:51.342
"He flooded Cairo with kindness,

00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:54.903
spending so much in the markets
of North Africa and the Middle East

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:59.115
that it affected the price of gold
into the next decade."

00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:01.628
And on his return,

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:05.098
Mansa Musa memorialized his journey

00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:11.142
by building a mosque
at the heart of his empire.

00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:14.438
And the legacy of what he left behind,

00:14:14.462 --> 00:14:16.139
Timbuktu,

00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:21.423
it represents one of the great bodies
of written historical material

00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:23.630
produced by African scholars:

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:26.876
about 700,000 medieval documents,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.099
ranging from scholarly works to letters,

00:14:30.123 --> 00:14:33.171
which have been preserved
often by private households.

00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:36.678
And at its peak,
in the 15th and 16th centuries,

00:14:36.702 --> 00:14:40.690
the university there was as influential

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.760
as any educational
establishment in Europe,

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:46.778
attracting about 25,000 students.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:50.368
This was in a city
of around 100,000 people.

00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:55.570
It cemented Timbuktu
as a world center of learning.

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:59.801
But this was a very particular
kind of learning

00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:03.053
that was focused and driven by Islam.

00:15:03.594 --> 00:15:05.837
And since I first visited Timbuktu,

00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:08.722
I've visited many other
libraries across Africa,

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:14.041
and despite Hegel's view
that Africa has no history,

00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:18.278
not only is it a continent
with an embarrassment of history,

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:23.132
it has developed unrivaled systems
for collecting and promoting it.

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:26.455
There are thousands of small archives,

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:28.377
textile drum stores,

00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:33.272
that have become more than repositories
of manuscripts and material culture.

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:36.435
They have become fonts
of communal narrative,

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:38.719
symbols of continuity,

00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:41.869
and I'm pretty sure that many
of those European philosophers

00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:45.390
who questioned an African
intellectual tradition

00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:48.291
must have, beneath their prejudices,

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:53.506
been aware of the contribution
of Africa's intellectuals

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.863
to Western learning.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.125
They must have known

00:15:56.149 --> 00:15:58.977
of the great North African
medieval philosophers

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.493
who had driven the Mediterranean.

00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:04.628
They must have known about
and been aware of

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.969
that tradition that is part
of Christianity, of the three wise men.

00:16:09.993 --> 00:16:13.982
And in the medieval period,
Balthazar, that third wise man,

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.709
was represented as an African king.

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:19.337
And he became hugely popular

00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:23.346
as the third intellectual leg
of Old World learning,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.868
alongside Europe and Asia, as a peer.

00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:31.528
These things were well-known.

00:16:31.552 --> 00:16:35.176
These communities
did not grow up in isolation.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.309
Timbuktu's wealth and power developed
because the city became

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:43.413
a hub of lucrative
intercontinental trade routes.

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.603
This was one center

00:16:45.627 --> 00:16:48.177
in a borderless, transcontinental,

00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:52.088
ambitious, outwardly focused,
confident continent.

00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:56.796
Berber merchants,
they carried salt and textiles

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.620
and new precious goods and learning
down into West Africa

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:03.200
from across the desert.

00:17:03.224 --> 00:17:06.695
But as you can see from this map

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:10.964
that was produced a little time
after the life of Mansa Musa,

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:15.590
there was also a nexus
of sub-Saharan trade routes,

00:17:15.614 --> 00:17:18.874
along which African ideas and traditions

00:17:18.898 --> 00:17:22.521
added to the intellectual
worth of Timbuktu

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:25.525
and indeed across the desert to Europe.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.150
Manuscripts and material culture,

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:35.101
they have become fonts
of communal narrative,

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.168
symbols of continuity.

00:17:37.192 --> 00:17:41.903
And I'm pretty sure that
those European intellectuals

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:45.661
who cast aspersions on our history,

00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:49.600
they knew fundamentally
about our traditions.

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:54.865
And today, as strident forces
like Ansar Dine and Boko Haram

00:17:54.889 --> 00:17:56.802
grow popular in West Africa,

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:02.436
it's that spirit of truly indigenous,
dynamic, intellectual defiance

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.414
that holds ancient
traditions in good stead.

00:18:05.438 --> 00:18:08.637
When Mansa Musa made Timbuktu his capital,

00:18:08.661 --> 00:18:12.639
he looked upon the city
as a Medici looked upon Florence:

00:18:12.663 --> 00:18:17.722
as the center of an open, intellectual,
entrepreneurial empire

00:18:17.746 --> 00:18:21.063
that thrived on great ideas
wherever they came from.

00:18:21.087 --> 00:18:23.336
The city, the culture,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.478
the very intellectual DNA of this region

00:18:26.502 --> 00:18:30.195
remains so beautifully
complex and diverse,

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:32.888
that it will always remain, in part,

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:37.224
located in storytelling traditions
that derive from indigenous,

00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:39.013
pre-Islamic traditions.

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:44.644
The highly successful form of Islam
that developed in Mali became popular

00:18:44.668 --> 00:18:46.717
because it accepted those freedoms

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:49.223
and that inherent cultural diversity.

00:18:49.247 --> 00:18:51.674
And the celebration of that complexity,

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:55.723
that love of rigorously
contested discourse,

00:18:55.747 --> 00:18:57.591
that appreciation of narrative,

00:18:57.615 --> 00:19:00.889
was and remains, in spite of everything,

00:19:00.913 --> 00:19:04.323
the very heart of West Africa.

00:19:04.347 --> 00:19:08.929
And today, as the shrines and the mosque
vandalized by Ansar Dine

00:19:08.953 --> 00:19:10.110
have been rebuilt,

00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:13.961
many of the instigators
of their destruction have been jailed.

00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:16.887
And we are left with powerful lessons,

00:19:16.911 --> 00:19:21.267
reminded once again
of how our history and narrative

00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:25.198
have held communities
together for millennia,

00:19:25.222 --> 00:19:28.948
how they remain vital
in making sense of modern Africa.

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:31.416
And we're also reminded

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.464
of how the roots of this confident,
intellectual, entrepreneurial,

00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:41.272
outward-facing, culturally porous,
tariff-free Africa

00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:43.762
was once the envy of the world.

00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:46.751
But those roots, they remain.

00:19:46.775 --> 00:19:47.988
Thank you very much.

00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:52.162
(Applause)
