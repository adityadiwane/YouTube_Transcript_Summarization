00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
We stood on the railroad tracks

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
that ran between my friend's house and the beach.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
but at that point the water had receded

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
to a level three or four feet below normal.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
I'd never seen the reef here before.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
They were trying to catch fish.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
No one realized that this was a very bad idea.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
The people on the tracks just continued to watch them.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
I turned around to check on my friend's house.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
Then someone on the tracks screamed.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.330
The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.330
The children managed to run back onto the tracks.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
and was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
It continued to rise.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.330
I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
and that he would rather die there than run.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
to get his dog, who was apparently afraid.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.330
An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
The slum built on the railroad reservation

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
and no one was there when the water rose.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.330
For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
all of this was from the houses in the slum.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
This may seem hard to believe --

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
One of the scariest things about the tsunami

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
to catch a boat to the hospital.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
We don't think another wave is coming right away.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
At the Phi Phi Hill Resort,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
but I strained to listen for information.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
which triggered the massive tsunami.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Having this news was comforting in some small way

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
to understand what had just happened to us.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
However, the report focused on what had already occurred

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and offered no information on what to expect now.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
knew anything with any certainty.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
that essentially sprang up after it occurred.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.330
I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
that also were shown on blogs.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
I should warn you, they're pretty powerful.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:14.330
(Screaming)

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
Voice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
Voice 2: It's coming again?

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Voice 2: Come get inside here.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Voice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
Voice 1: It's coming again. New wave!

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
[Unclear]

00:04:44.330 --> 00:05:04.330
(Screaming)

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
They called me out here.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.330
James Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.330
In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.330
because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
although initially -- that is, in that first day --

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
and some people complained about this.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
They said, "The blogsters let us down."

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
What became very clear was that,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.330
within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.330
and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
in a way that we never had been able to get before.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.330
writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.330
a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.330
of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.330
a moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of --

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
the sublime in the traditional sense of the word,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
Because when we think about blogs,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
I think for most of us who are concerned about them,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.330
we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
And I want to ask three questions in this talk,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
about what motivates people to do things?

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.330
The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
of accessing a kind of collective intelligence

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
that has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.330
And then the third part is, What are the potential problems,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
or the dark side of blogs as we know them?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
OK, the first question:

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
What do they tell us about why people do things?

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
and, of course, the Internet more generally --

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and it's going to seem like a very obvious point,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
but I think it is an important one to think about --

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.330
every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
are doing so primarily for free.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.330
to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.330
And this is -- at least, to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.330
because the traditional account of economic man would say that,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.330
basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
But instead, what we're finding on the Internet --

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.330
and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
to work together without any money involved at all.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.330
The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.330
talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
who are producing enormous amounts of material

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
for no reason other than to tell their stories.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
That's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.330
for organizing a whole host of activities down the road.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
or, you have to pay for it to be good,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
without any money at all changing hands.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
There are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
or they love the attention, or whatever it is.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
and, I think, is writing about this more,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
but this notion of voluntary cooperation

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.330
The second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
in terms of accessing collective intelligence?

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
And they can actually often be smarter

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
than even the smartest person within them.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.330
to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
If I had a jar of jellybeans

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
your average guess would be remarkably good.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
of the number of beans in the jar,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
but for the most part the group's guess

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
would be better than just about all of you.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
in many more complicated situations.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
is forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
You know, if you think about something like Google,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
we call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
or a remarkable intelligence in it.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
Dan Gillmor -- whose book "We the Media"

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
is included in the gift pack --

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
has talked about it as saying that, as a writer,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
he's recognized that his readers know more than he does.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.330
that he or she knows better than everyone else.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:57.330
of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
and that we know is available to us

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.330
if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Each blog post, each blog commentary

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.330
may not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.330
but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
more often than not is going to give you a very interesting

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
and enormously valuable picture of what's going on.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
So, that's the positive side of it.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
That's the positive side of what is sometimes called

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:31.330
participatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
that, in fact, we are giving people

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
who have never been able to talk before a voice,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
and we're able to access information that has always been there

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
but has essentially gone untapped.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
But there is a dark side to this,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
bottom-up structure of the Internet.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.330
It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things --

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
that being linked from one place to another,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.330
that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
And much of the time it is.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.330
But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.330
the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
once you are linked in the network,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
the network starts to shape your views

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
A network is not just the product of its component parts.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
It is something more than that.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
Now, this has all these benefits:

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
it gives you access to a whole host of people;

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.330
But the problem is that groups are only smart

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
when the people in them are as independent as possible.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
or the paradox of collective intelligence,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.330
that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
And networks make it harder for people to do that,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.330
because they drive attention to the things that the network values.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.330
is that once a meme, once an idea gets going,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
because other people have, say, a link.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And that phenomenon

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.330
of piling on the existing links

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
particularly of the political blogosphere,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and it is one that essentially throws off

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.330
The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
A lot of people talk about ants.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.330
the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
no individual ant knows what it's doing,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.004
but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.

00:15:29.123 --> 00:15:32.179
They're able to reach food
as efficiently as possible,

00:15:32.204 --> 00:15:36.230
they're able to guide their traffic
with remarkable speed.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
So, the ant colony is a great model:

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.330
you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
But we know that occasionally ants go astray,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.330
and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
they start to follow a simple rule --

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.330
just do what the ant in front of you does.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.330
And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.330
And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.330
and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.330
in a circle until they died.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.330
And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.330
That's the thing we have to fear --

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.330
is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
because one of the great things about the tsunami --

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
in terms of the blogosphere's coverage,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
not in terms of the tsunami itself --

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.330
is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.330
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.330
You saw people being able to offer up
their independent points of view

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.330
in a way that they hadn't before.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.330
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.330
And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.512
Thank you very much. (Applause)
