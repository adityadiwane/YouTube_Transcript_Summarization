00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
gives one impression.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what's going on.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the power of, and importance of, independent media

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
than I could say in an hour.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And also start with a little bit of statistics.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
lives in the societies without independent press.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
does not really know what is going on in their countries.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The information they get gets filtered through somebody

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who either twists that information, or colors that information,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
does something with it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Enjoy it while it lasts.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but they can also lose press freedom,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But that's totally another and separate topic.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I can go back to my story.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
At that time I was running B92, the only independent,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where government really wants to make your life miserable.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And there are different ways.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But what they really do, which is very powerful,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if they don't like independent media companies --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you know, they threaten your advertisers.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
no matter how much does it make sense for them --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
do not want to come and advertise.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And you have a problem making ends meet.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
which was, you know, survival below one side,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but what was really painful for me was,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
in a slow-motion downfall.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And we all had all of that on tapes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We had the ability to understand what was going on.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We were actually recording history.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to keep archives of that history.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It was still 1991.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He was running a media systems organization

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And what did I know at that time about media systems?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I would think media systems were organizations,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which means they should help you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the small one and the big one.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The small one was, I just wanted him

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
to help us get those damn tapes,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Because I thought, I still maintain,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that serious and independent media companies are great business.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
media company in the country.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
great suit and tie.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the war will be.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of Michael Jackson?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
That was really the only question he had.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
because I thought there must be an institution in the world

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that is providing loans to media companies.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's so obvious, straight in your face,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and somebody must have thought of it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Somebody must have started something like that.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you could not just Google in '91.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So I thought that that's actually my problem.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
trying for the third time to convince him that

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
his foundation should invest in something that should

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
operate like a media bank.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And basically what I was saying is very simple.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's business anywhere.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
At the end of the meeting he says,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
See that it will not work.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(Laughter)

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I knew two things after that meeting.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
But it's one thing to have a concept;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
You know, you find somebody who is respectable

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and has a lot of money.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You collect interest and do nothing in between.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The government cutting them off

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So here's the daily newspaper

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
That means that they have no sports;

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
they have no latest news; circulation goes down.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
They come to us with a request for a loan.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
They want to -- the only way for them to survive

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is to get a printing press.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And we said, that's fine; let's meet;

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We start the meeting.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
so it's much bigger.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But however you put it, you know, the numbers

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
do not make any sense.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And that's the best they could do.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We were the best that they could do.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So that is how we understood what our method is.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's not a bank. We had to actually

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
go into these companies and earn our return

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
by fixing them -- by establishing management systems,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Just quickly on the results.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
average interest rate five percent to six percent.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And here is the most stunning number.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
What do we typically finance?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We finance anything that a media company would need,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
from printing presses to transmitters.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
What is most important is we do it

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
either in form of loans, equities, lease --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We believe that in the last 10 years companies

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that we've financed are actually the best media companies

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in the developing world.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
That is a "Who is Who" list.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And I could spend hours talking about them,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
because they're all kind of heroes.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and depending on time I may give you two examples

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
who we work with.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and moved to Russia.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
In the south of Russia there's a guy called

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
an independent newspaper there.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The city was closed until early '90s

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
After two years working with us, he becomes

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the most respected newspaper in that small place.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Governor comes to him one day,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
actually invites him to come to his office.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And I want to offer you a deal.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
because I have elections --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
there are elections coming up in nine months.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I will not run, but it's very important for me

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
who is going to succeed me.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I have no interest in being in media business.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
How much would that cost?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The governor says, "We will close you."

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Six months later the newspaper was closed.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So what the governor got was an empty shell.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and if you are a banker for independent media.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So it sounds like a great story.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But there is a second angle to that.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The second angle, like in this clip.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
If you take the camera above, you start thinking

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
about these numbers again.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
That is not too much, is it?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's actually just a drop in the sea.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Because when you think about the importance,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
some of the issues that we were talking about last night --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
this last session we had about Africa and his

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
giving voice to unheard, to poor --

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
it's why independent media is in business.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it's why it was invented.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So from that perspective, what we did is just really

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Now ours is just one story.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of nonprofits doing spectacular work.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Here is where the problem is,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And it's called fundraising.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Imagine that this third of this room is filled

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
with people who represent different foundations.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
doing very important work.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Now imagine that every second person over here

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Now that is how difficult it is to match people

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
from this side of the room

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
with people of that side of the room.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You know, instead of people running in this dark,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
trying to find their own match, who will be willing,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
who has the same goals.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Instead of all of that we thought there is --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
something new needs to be invented.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
press freedom bonds.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
If there are investors willing to finance

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
U.S. government budget deficit,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
press freedom deficit?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
find enough investors that this can be considered a success,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
there's nothing stopping the next organization

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to start to issue bonds next spring.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And those can be environmental bonds.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
electricity in Bangladesh bonds.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And before you know it, any social cause

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
can be actually financed in this way.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But let's take the idea further.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
You can bring it to Asia.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
You can, once you have all of those different points,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
you can make it easy for investors.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Put all of those bonds at one place

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and they sit down and click.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Once you have more than 10 of them

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
you have to develop some kind of a matrix.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
What do investors get?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
On one side financial, on the other side social.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Morningstar type.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Now take it to the last step.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Once you have all of that put together,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
a marketplace for all of that,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And in that way you organize the financing

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
so there are no dark rooms, no blind people

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
running around to find each other.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Thank you.
