00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
The new me is beauty.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.160
(Laughter)

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.160
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
but it would be ugly."

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
This is neat.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Thank you for setting up my display.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
I mean, it's just wonderful.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
but I want it.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And that's my new life.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
and "pretty," and "emotions."

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.840
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house --

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
(Laughter)

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.880
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.880
and it comes with a little slip of paper

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
The acid will ruin the gold plating.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
(Laughter)

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
(Laughter)

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.040
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced:

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.440
it holds well, it feels well.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.480
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
It's a delight to use.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.480
And so it's got everything, right?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.480
It's beautiful and it's functional.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
And I can tell you stories about it,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.480
which makes it reflective,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
And those are the three components.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480
with fish swimming in it.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.480
the ripples spread out and the fish run away.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480
But of course, then the ball hits the other side,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
(Laughter)

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480
No. But is it fun?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Yeah! Yeah.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480
Or look at Google.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.480
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.480
you get 10 pages of results.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.480
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480
This is one through 20. Next,"

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.520
they just give you as many o's as there are pages.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
It's really simple and subtle.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.520
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520
That's the subconscious mind

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.520
that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520
and you didn't know why.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520
And it's just clever.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520
And of course, what's especially good is,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520
if you type "design and emotion,"

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.520
the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520
(Laughter)

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
Now, the weird thing is Google lies,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520
because if I type "design and emotion,"

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.520
it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520
So, OK.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520
So I type "design emotion"

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
and my website wasn't first again.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520
It was third.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.520
Oh well, different story.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.240
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240
about the MINI Cooper automobile.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.520
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520
Buy it anyway.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520
It's so much fun to drive."

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520
And if you look at the inside of the car --

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.520
I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
this is me taking a picture while my son is driving --

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520
and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.520
It's round, it's neat.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.520
The controls work wonderfully.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.520
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.520
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.520
and that never made any sense to me

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520
until I finally figured out -- look ...

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520
and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.520
I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.520
No problem.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.520
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.520
and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
Intense fear paralyzes you.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
It actually affects the way the brain works.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.800
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800
until just a few days or hours before the talk,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.800
and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
That's what fear and anxiety does;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.800
it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing --

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
to focus, not be distracted.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
And I couldn't force myself across that.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800
But it really changes the way you think.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
did this wonderful experiment.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
She brought students in to solve problems.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
So, she'd bring people into the room,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800
and there'd be a string hanging down here

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
and a string hanging down here.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it --

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.800
some papers and scissors and stuff.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800
And she'd bring them in,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800
and she'd say,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800
"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
Would you tie those two strings together?"

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
and they couldn't reach the other string.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800
Still can't reach it.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
And, basically, none of them could solve it.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.800
You bring in a second group of people,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800
and you say, "Oh, before we start,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800
Would you like the box of candy?"

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
not very happy, but a little bit of happy.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800
And guess what -- they solved the problem.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800
And it turns out that when you're anxious

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.800
you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800
makes you depth-first.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.800
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence --

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800
you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800
which makes you a breadth-first problem solver:

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.800
you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800
That's what brainstorming is about, right?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800
and we say, "No criticism,"

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800
and you get all these weird, neat ideas.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.800
because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.800
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.800
You've got be anxious.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.800
The brain works differently

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800
if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
No big deal.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.200
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.240
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to
like bright colors.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.240
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.240
and bright plants, because you eat the fruit

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.240
and you thereby spread the seed.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.240
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.240
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.240
we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.240
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.240
we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.640
So that's the visceral level.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.640
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.640
like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.640
Or the 1963 Jaguar:

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.640
It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.640
but the owners love it.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.640
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.640
A water bottle:

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.640
You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.640
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.640
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.640
or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.640
It's all about the visceral experience.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.360
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.360
and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.360
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.360
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.360
Almost everything we do is subconscious.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.360
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.360
it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360
Most of what we do is subconscious.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.360
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.360
controlled by the behavioral side.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.360
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.360
which includes usability, understanding --

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.360
but also the feel and heft.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.360
That's why the Global knives are so neat.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.360
that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.400
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.440
over a demanding curb --

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.440
again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.440
Or the sensual feeling.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.440
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.440
and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.440
It will squirt you all around

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.440
and you can stay in that shower for hours --

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440
and not waste water, by the way,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.440
because it recirculates the same dirty water.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.440
(Laughter)

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.440
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.440
at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.440
That's kind of what the teapot looks like

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.680
but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720
and you put tea in,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.720
and then you fill it with water.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.720
The water then seeps over the tea.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.720
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right --

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
the tea is to the right of this line.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.720
and the water is filling it up like that.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.720
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.720
And that means the tea is partially covered

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720
while it completes the brewing.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.720
And when it's finished, you put it vertically,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720
and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.720
and the water only comes to here --

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.720
and so it keeps the tea out.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.720
On top of that, it communicates,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720
which is what emotion does.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.720
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720
It's being safe in the world.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.720
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it --

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.720
saying good, bad, safe, dangerous,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.720
and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.720
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else --

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720
because their muscles are acting, subconsciously,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.720
except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.720
Well, this has emotions if you like,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.720
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.720
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.720
And the third level is reflective,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.720
which is, if you like the superego,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.720
it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720
no control over the -- doesn't see the senses,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720
doesn't control the muscles.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720
It looks over what's going on.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720
It's that little voice in your head

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.720
that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.200
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.240
Here's a great reflective product.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.240
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life --

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.240
all sorts of exotic cars,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.240
but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.880
It's about attention. It's about their image,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.920
not about the car.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.920
If you want a more positive model --

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.920
this is the GM car.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.920
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.920
And you'll buy it to protect the environment,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.920
even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.920
and not perfected.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.920
But that's reflective design as well.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.920
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people --

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.920
"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920
As opposed to this one,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920
which is a pure behavioral watch,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.920
which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920
But it's ugly.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.920
This is a clear Don Norman watch.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.920
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.920
the visceral fear of falling

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.920
against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.920
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.920
So, it's pitting one against the other.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The other neat thing ...

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
(Laughter)

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And this is his chair with claw,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the poor little chair has lost its ball

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And that's what's nice about emotion.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So that's the new me.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
(Laughter)

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Applause)
