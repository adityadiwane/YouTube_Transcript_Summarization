00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.190
We are going to take a quick voyage

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.697
over the cognitive history of the 20th century,

00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.486
because during that century,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.400
our minds have altered dramatically.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.724
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900

00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:28.798
have altered because the roads are better

00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:31.153
and because of technology.

00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:33.122
And our minds have altered, too.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:37.066
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.465
and analyzed that world primarily in terms

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.698
of how much it would benefit them

00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:47.290
to people who confront a very complex world,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.499
and it's a world where we've had to develop

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.994
new mental habits, new habits of mind.

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:54.991
And these include things like

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.005
clothing that concrete world with classification,

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.927
introducing abstractions that we try to make

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.123
logically consistent,

00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:06.953
and also taking the hypothetical seriously,

00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:09.203
that is, wondering about what might have been

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.595
rather than what is.

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.147
Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:18.907
through massive I.Q. gains over time,

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:21.276
and these have been truly massive.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:25.687
That is, we don't just get a few more questions right

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:27.160
on I.Q. tests.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.619
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.867
than each succeeding generation

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.777
back to the time that they were invented.

00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:39.075
Indeed, if you score the people a century ago

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:40.623
against modern norms,

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:43.994
they would have an average I.Q. of 70.

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:46.719
If you score us against their norms,

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.318
we would have an average I.Q. of 130.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.675
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.580
Were our immediate ancestors

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.815
on the verge of mental retardation?

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.890
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.922
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:10.158
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.

00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:13.278
Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:17.331
that's much more illuminating than either of those,

00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:19.953
and to put this into perspective,

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:22.858
let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth

00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:25.693
and found a ruined civilization.

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:28.100
And this Martian was an archaeologist,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.987
and they found scores, target scores,

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:33.910
that people had used for shooting.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.413
And first they looked at 1865,

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:38.484
and they found that in a minute,

00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:42.193
people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:44.510
And then they found, in 1898,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.294
that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.

00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:53.521
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:57.376
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.973
They would say, look, these tests were designed

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:03.571
to find out how much people were steady of hand,

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:06.346
how keen their eyesight was,

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:08.684
whether they had control of their weapon.

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:11.705
How could these performances have escalated

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:13.887
to this enormous degree?

00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:16.162
Well we now know, of course, the answer.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.974
If that Martian looked at battlefields,

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:21.798
they would find that people had only muskets

00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:23.862
at the time of the Civil War

00:03:23.862 --> 00:03:25.669
and that they had repeating rifles

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.854
at the time of the Spanish-American War,

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:30.590
and then they had machine guns

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.405
by the time of World War I.

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:35.956
And, in other words, it was the equipment

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:38.123
that was in the hands of the average soldier

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:41.186
that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.359
or steadiness of hand.

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.679
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.172
that we have picked up over those hundred years,

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:54.235
and I think again that another thinker will help us here,

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:56.370
and that's Luria.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.514
Luria looked at people

00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:02.167
just before they entered the scientific age,

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.164
and he found that these people

00:04:04.164 --> 00:04:07.821
were resistant to classifying the concrete world.

00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:08.875
They wanted to break it up

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:11.465
into little bits that they could use.

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:13.755
He found that they were resistant

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:17.256
to deducing the hypothetical,

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.933
to speculating about what might be,

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:22.570
and he found finally that they didn't deal well

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.967
with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.107
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:32.473
He talked to the head man of a person

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:34.305
in rural Russia.

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:36.779
They'd only had, as people had in 1900,

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.960
about four years of schooling.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.320
And he asked that particular person,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.790
what do crows and fish have in common?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.857
And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:50.850
You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.176
A crow can peck at a fish.

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.027
A fish can't do anything to a crow."

00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:59.253
And Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"

00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:00.663
And he said, "Of course not.

00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:02.650
One's a fish.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.422
The other is a bird."

00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:06.444
And he was interested, effectively,

00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:10.112
in what he could do with those concrete objects.

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.990
And then Luria went to another person,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.173
and he said to them,

00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:17.869
"There are no camels in Germany.

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:20.280
Hamburg is a city in Germany.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.823
Are there camels in Hamburg?"

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:23.714
And the fellow said,

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:27.933
"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:31.827
And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"

00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:34.104
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:36.673
and there's no room for camels."

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:38.936
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:41.733
as anything but a concrete problem,

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:44.291
and he was used to camels being in villages,

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:48.224
and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,

00:05:48.224 --> 00:05:53.131
to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.

00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:55.944
A third interview was conducted

00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:58.928
with someone about the North Pole.

00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:03.033
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:06.988
Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.

00:06:06.988 --> 00:06:10.267
What color are the bears at the North Pole?"

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:12.669
And the response was, "Such a thing

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.979
is to be settled by testimony.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.803
If a wise person came from the North Pole

00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.654
and told me the bears were white,

00:06:19.654 --> 00:06:21.133
I might believe him,

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:25.338
but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."

00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:28.322
Now you see again, this person has rejected

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.517
going beyond the concrete world

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:33.690
and analyzing it through everyday experience,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.556
and it was important to that person

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:37.118
what color bears were --

00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:39.399
that is, they had to hunt bears.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.808
They weren't willing to engage in this.

00:06:41.808 --> 00:06:43.645
One of them said to Luria,

00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:47.145
"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:49.036
None of these problems are real.

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:51.679
How can we address them?"

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:55.224
Now, these three categories --

00:06:55.224 --> 00:06:56.715
classification,

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.856
using logic on abstractions,

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:01.625
taking the hypothetical seriously --

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:04.063
how much difference do they make in the real world

00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:05.956
beyond the testing room?

00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:08.926
And let me give you a few illustrations.

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:12.315
First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.712
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education

00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:18.489
to 12 years of formal education,

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.390
and 52 percent of Americans

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.210
have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.242
Now, not only do we have much more education,

00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:30.935
and much of that education is scientific,

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:34.945
and you can't do science without classifying the world.

00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:38.804
You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.

00:07:38.804 --> 00:07:42.978
You can't do science without making it logically consistent.

00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:46.788
And even down in grade school, things have changed.

00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:49.722
In 1910, they looked at the examinations

00:07:49.722 --> 00:07:53.542
that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.148
and they found that they were all

00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:58.583
for socially valued concrete information.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:07:59.914
They were things like,

00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:02.801
what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states

00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:05.175
that existed at that time?

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:06.753
When they looked at the exams

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:09.900
that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.286
they were all about abstractions.

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.879
They were things like,

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:19.013
why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?

00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:20.577
And you were supposed to think, well,

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:23.791
the state legislature was rural-controlled,

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.889
and they hated the big city,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.482
so rather than putting the capital in a big city,

00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:29.920
they put it in a county seat.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.656
They put it in Albany rather than New York.

00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:35.712
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.

00:08:35.712 --> 00:08:37.647
And so forth.

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:40.078
So the tenor of education has changed.

00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:44.112
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,

00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:47.690
to use abstractions, and to link them logically.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.071
What about employment?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.971
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans

00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:57.513
practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.

00:08:57.513 --> 00:09:01.568
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.

00:09:01.568 --> 00:09:04.431
Today, 35 percent of Americans

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:07.750
practice cognitively demanding professions,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.376
not only to the professions proper like lawyer

00:09:10.376 --> 00:09:12.925
or doctor or scientist or lecturer,

00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:14.743
but many, many sub-professions

00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:16.684
having to do with being a technician,

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:18.709
a computer programmer.

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:23.033
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.

00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:25.963
And we can only meet the terms of employment

00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:28.460
in the modern world by being cognitively

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.721
far more flexible.

00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.944
And it's not just that we have many more people

00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:36.934
in cognitively demanding professions.

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:39.337
The professions have been upgraded.

00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:41.448
Compare the doctor in 1900,

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:44.497
who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,

00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:47.305
with the modern general practitioner or specialist,

00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:49.984
with years of scientific training.

00:09:49.984 --> 00:09:52.253
Compare the banker in 1900,

00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:54.666
who really just needed a good accountant

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.842
and to know who was trustworthy in the local community

00:09:57.842 --> 00:10:00.133
for paying back their mortgage.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.362
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees

00:10:03.362 --> 00:10:05.128
may have been morally remiss,

00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:08.267
but they were cognitively very agile.

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:12.878
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.045
They had to look at computer projections

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:17.045
for the housing market.

00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:20.950
They had to get complicated CDO-squared

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.400
in order to bundle debt together

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.159
and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.259
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.370
to give it a AAA,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.604
though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.633
And they also, of course, had to get people

00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:40.320
to accept these so-called assets

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.820
and pay money for them

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.407
even though they were highly vulnerable.

00:10:44.407 --> 00:10:45.997
Or take a farmer today.

00:10:45.997 --> 00:10:49.277
I take the farm manager of today as very different

00:10:49.277 --> 00:10:51.768
from the farmer of 1900.

00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:53.606
So it hasn't just been the spread

00:10:53.606 --> 00:10:56.797
of cognitively demanding professions.

00:10:56.797 --> 00:10:59.177
It's also been the upgrading of tasks

00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:01.744
like lawyer and doctor and what have you

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.521
that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.

00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:08.680
But I've talked about education and employment.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.019
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.626
over the 20th century

00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:16.221
have paid off in unexpected areas.

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:18.492
I'm primarily a moral philosopher.

00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:22.180
I merely have a holiday in psychology,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.588
and what interests me in general is moral debate.

00:11:26.588 --> 00:11:29.319
Now over the last century,

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:31.669
in developed nations like America,

00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:33.650
moral debate has escalated

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.989
because we take the hypothetical seriously,

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:40.204
and we also take universals seriously

00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:43.000
and look for logical connections.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.735
When I came home in 1955 from university

00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:49.042
at the time of Martin Luther King,

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.364
a lot of people came home at that time

00:11:51.364 --> 00:11:55.114
and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:58.342
My father was born in 1885,

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.905
and he was mildly racially biased.

00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:03.008
As an Irishman, he hated the English so much

00:12:03.008 --> 00:12:05.329
he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.

00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:08.600
(Laughter)

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.108
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.956
And when we said to our parents and grandparents,

00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:20.449
"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:24.070
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.572
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --

00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:28.974
(Laughter) --

00:12:28.974 --> 00:12:30.204
that turned black?

00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:33.720
In other words, they were fixed in the concrete

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.233
mores and attitudes they had inherited.

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:40.244
They would not take the hypothetical seriously,

00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:41.728
and without the hypothetical,

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:45.747
it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.

00:12:45.747 --> 00:12:48.382
You have to say, imagine you were

00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:53.967
in Iran, and imagine that your relatives

00:12:53.967 --> 00:12:56.667
all suffered from collateral damage

00:12:56.667 --> 00:12:58.613
even though they had done no wrong.

00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:00.674
How would you feel about that?

00:13:00.674 --> 00:13:03.394
And if someone of the older generation says,

00:13:03.394 --> 00:13:05.324
well, our government takes care of us,

00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:08.267
and it's up to their government to take care of them,

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:12.335
they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.

00:13:12.335 --> 00:13:15.702
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,

00:13:15.702 --> 00:13:18.912
and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.

00:13:18.912 --> 00:13:21.272
Well, he's treating his mores

00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:25.172
as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.817
and they're unmovable in any way by logic.

00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:30.393
They're just inherited mores.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.594
Today we would say something like,

00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:36.171
well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.

00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.844
Would you deserve to be killed?

00:13:37.844 --> 00:13:40.739
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:44.761
That's not one of the principles I've got.

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:47.602
Well you, today, universalize your principles.

00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:51.159
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:53.432
If you have a principle such as,

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.078
people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,

00:13:57.078 --> 00:13:59.174
then to exclude black people

00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:01.672
you've got to make exceptions, don't you?

00:14:01.672 --> 00:14:04.660
You have to say, well, blackness of skin,

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.283
you couldn't suffer just for that.

00:14:07.283 --> 00:14:10.546
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.

00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:13.713
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,

00:14:13.713 --> 00:14:16.629
and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:20.423
when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.

00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:23.848
And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,

00:14:23.848 --> 00:14:28.402
because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.339
You're treating them as universals,

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:33.118
to be rendered consistent by logic.

00:14:33.118 --> 00:14:36.248
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?

00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:40.258
That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:42.143
If you look at the I.Q. test,

00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:46.128
you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.

00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:48.731
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler

00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:51.000
is about classification,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.080
and we have made enormous gains

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.190
on that classification subtest.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.471
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery

00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:02.567
that are about using logic on abstractions.

00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:06.041
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,

00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:08.579
and it's all about analogies.

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:12.435
And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.

00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:16.780
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.356
What are dogs like?

00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:20.448
They would say wolves.

00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:23.992
But by 1960, people could attack Raven's

00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:26.642
on a much more sophisticated level.

00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:31.149
If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:33.385
what follows two circles?

00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:35.672
They could say a semicircle.

00:15:35.672 --> 00:15:37.850
Just as a triangle is half of a square,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.568
a semicircle is half of a circle.

00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:44.161
By 2010, college graduates, if you said

00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:47.396
two circles followed by a semicircle,

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:50.186
two sixteens followed by what,

00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:53.922
they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.

00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:56.788
That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world

00:15:56.788 --> 00:15:59.081
that they could even ignore

00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:03.604
the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.

00:16:03.604 --> 00:16:06.768
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.

00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:09.640
We haven't made progress on all fronts.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.404
One of the ways in which we would like to deal

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.602
with the sophistication of the modern world

00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:16.638
is through politics,

00:16:16.638 --> 00:16:19.973
and sadly you can have humane moral principles,

00:16:19.973 --> 00:16:24.393
you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,

00:16:24.393 --> 00:16:27.323
and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,

00:16:27.323 --> 00:16:29.750
you can't do politics.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.770
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.645
that they read less history and less literature

00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:38.255
and less material about foreign lands,

00:16:38.255 --> 00:16:39.950
and they're essentially ahistorical.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.067
They live in the bubble of the present.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.923
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.

00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:49.106
They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.

00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:51.727
Think how different America would be

00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:55.323
if every American knew that this is the fifth time

00:16:55.323 --> 00:16:59.417
Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.781
and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened

00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:05.106
on those four previous occasions.

00:17:05.106 --> 00:17:06.056
(Laughter)

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:08.004
And that is, they had barely left,

00:17:08.004 --> 00:17:10.336
and there wasn't a trace in the sand.

00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:13.544
Or imagine how different things would be

00:17:13.544 --> 00:17:16.300
if most Americans knew that we had been lied

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.225
into four of our last six wars.

00:17:19.225 --> 00:17:22.159
You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:24.417
the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel

00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:27.050
but was loaded with munitions,

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.128
the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,

00:17:31.128 --> 00:17:34.696
and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda

00:17:34.696 --> 00:17:36.605
and had nothing to do with it,

00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:40.408
and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people

00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:41.952
that they were brothers in arms,

00:17:41.952 --> 00:17:45.831
when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:49.300
But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.818
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves

00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:57.471
in ordinary people that we have now realized,

00:17:57.471 --> 00:17:59.535
and the aristocracy was convinced

00:17:59.535 --> 00:18:01.714
that the average person couldn't make it,

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:04.680
that they could never share their mindset

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.286
or their cognitive abilities.

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:09.000
Lord Curzon once said

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.264
he saw people bathing in the North Sea,

00:18:11.264 --> 00:18:12.927
and he said, "Why did no one tell me

00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:15.903
what white bodies the lower orders have?"

00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:18.254
As if they were a reptile.

00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:21.304
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]

00:18:21.304 --> 00:18:25.014
[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady

00:18:25.014 --> 00:18:28.223
are sisters underneath the skin."

00:18:28.223 --> 00:18:32.223
(Applause)
