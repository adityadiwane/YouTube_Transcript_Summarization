00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm going to read a few strips.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
These are, most of these are

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
from a monthly page I do

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
in and architecture and design magazine

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
called Metropolis.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And the first story is called

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
"The Faulty Switch."

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
Another beautifully designed new building

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.330
ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
It's fine during the day

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
But at dusk

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
everything changes.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
The architect spent hundreds of hours

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
designing the burnished brass switchplates

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
for his new office tower.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
And then left it to a contractor

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
to install these 79-cent switches behind them.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
We know instinctively where to reach

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
when we enter a dark room.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
But the sound we are greeted with,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
as the room is bathed in the simulated glow

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
of late-afternoon light,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
recalls to mind

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
a dirty men's room

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
(Laughter)

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
This sound colors our first impression of any room;

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
it can't be helped.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
But where does this sound,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
commonly described as a click, come from?

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
Is it simply the byproduct of a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
crude mechanical action?

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
Or is it an imitation

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
of one half the set of sounds we make

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
to express disappointment?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
The often dental consonant

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
of no Indo-European language.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Or is it the amplified sound

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
of a synapse firing

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
in the brain of a cockroach?

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330
In the 1950s they tried their best

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
to muffle this sound

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
with mercury switches

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
and silent knob controls.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
But today these improvements

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
seem somehow inauthentic.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
The click is the modern

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
triumphal clarion

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
proceeding us through life,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
announcing our entry into every lightless room.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.330
The sound made flicking a wall switch off

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
is of a completely different nature.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
It has a deep melancholy ring.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Children don't like it.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Adults find it comforting.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
But wouldn't it be an easy matter

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
to wire a wall switch

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.330
so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.330
Or the distant peel of thunder?

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Thomas Edison went through

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
thousands of unlikely substances

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
before he came upon the right one

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.330
for the filament of his electric light bulb.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
Why have we settled so quickly

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
for the sound of its switch?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
That's the end of that.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
(Applause)

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
The next story is called

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
"In Praise of the Taxpayer."

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
have survived yet another commercial building boom,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
is cause for celebration.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.330
These one or two story structures,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
designed to yield only enough income

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
to cover the taxes on the land

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
on which they stand,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
were not meant to be permanent buildings.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
Yet for one reason or another

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
they have confounded the efforts of developers

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
to be combined into lots

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
suitable for high-rise construction.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Although they make no claim to architectural beauty,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
they are, in their perfect temporariness,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
a delightful alternative

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
to the large-scale structures

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.330
that might someday take their place.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
The most perfect examples

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
occupy corner lots.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
They offer a pleasant respite

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
from the high-density development around them.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
A break of light and air,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
an architectural biding of time.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
So buried in signage

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
are these structures,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
that it often takes a moment

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
to distinguish the modern

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
specially constructed taxpayer

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
from its neighbor:

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
the small commercial building

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
from an earlier century,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
whose upper floors have been sealed,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
and whose groundfloor space

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.330
now functions as a taxpayer.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
The few surfaces not covered by signs

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
are often clad in a distinctive, dark

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.330
green-gray, striated aluminum siding.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Take-out sandwich shops,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
film processing drop-offs,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
peep-shows and necktie stores.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
Now these provisional structures have,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
in some cases,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
remained standing

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.330
for the better part of a human lifetime.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
The temporary building

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
is a triumph of modern industrial organization,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
a healthy sublimation

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
of the urge to build,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and proof that not every

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
architectural idea

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
need be set in stone.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
That's the end.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
(Laughter)

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
For the ancient Egyptians

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
the lap was a platform

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
upon which to place

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
the earthly possessions of the dead --

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
30 cubits from foot to knee.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
It was not until the 14th century

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
that an Italian painter

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
recognized the lap

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
as a Grecian temple,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330
upholstered in flesh and cloth.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Over the next 200 years

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
we see the infant Christ

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
go from a sitting to a standing position

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
on the Virgin's lap,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
and then back again.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Every child recapitulates this ascension,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
straddling one or both legs,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
sitting sideways,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
or leaning against the body.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.330
From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
is but a brief moment in history.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
You were late for school again this morning.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
The ventriloquist must first make us believe

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
that a small boy is sitting on his lap.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
The illusion of speech follows incidentally.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.330
What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
As adults we admire the lap

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
from a nostalgic distance.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
We have fading memories

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
of that provisional temple,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.330
erected each time an adult sat down.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.330
On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
It is children and teenage girls

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
who are most keenly aware

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.330
of its architectural beauty.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
They understand the structural integrity

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
of a deep avuncular lap,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
as compared to the shaky arrangement

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
of a neurotic niece in high heels.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.330
The relationship between the lap and its owner

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
is direct and intimate.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
I envision a 36-story,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.330
450-unit residential high-rise --

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
a reason to consider the mental health

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
of any architect before granting

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
an important commission.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
The bathrooms and kitchens will,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
of course, have no windows.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
The lap of luxury

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
is an architectural construct of childhood,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
which we seek, in vain,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
as adults, to employ.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
That's the end.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
(Laughter)

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection"

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
A nondescript warehouse,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
visible for a moment

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.330
from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.330
serves as the temporary resting place

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
for the Haverpiece collection

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
of European dried fruit.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
The profound convolutions

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
on the surface of a dried cherry.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.330
The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Do you remember wandering as a child

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
through those dark wooden

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
storefront galleries?

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
Where everything was displayed

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.330
in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Pears dried in the form

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
of genital organs.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
Apricot halves

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
like the ears of cherubim.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.330
In 1962 the unsold stock

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
a wealthy prune juice bottler,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.330
and consolidated to form the core collection.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
As an art form it lies somewhere between

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.330
still-life painting and plumbing.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Upon his death in 1967,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
a quarter of the items were sold off for compote

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
to a high-class hotel restaurant.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.330
(Laughter)

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
Unsuspecting guests were served

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
stewed turn-of-the-century

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
Turkish figs for breakfast.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.330
(Laughter)

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
The rest of the collection remains here,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
stored in plain brown paper bags

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
until funds can be raised
