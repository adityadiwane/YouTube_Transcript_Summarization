00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I was awakened once during the night.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
my blood pressure, 127 over 74.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
zero of alcohol.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
or the NPI-16,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is a reassuring 0.31.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
We know that numbers are useful for us

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
when we advertise, manage, govern, search.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
learn, remember

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and want to improve.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
noticed that people were subjecting themselves

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
such as stepping on a scale every day.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
People were tracking their food via Twitter,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
their kids' diapers on their iPhone.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
They were making detailed journals

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
of their spending, their mood,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
their symptoms, their treatments.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Now, we know some of the technological facts

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that are driving this change in our lifestyle --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
the exponential improvement in data storage

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and data processing,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
This little black dot there

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
is a 3D accelerometer.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It tracks your movement through space.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and they're going into all kinds of devices.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
But what's interesting

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is the incredible detailed information that you can get

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
from just one sensor like this.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
This kind of sensor

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is in the hit biometric device --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
It has just that sensor in it.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's really just a pressure sensor

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
like the kind that's in a doorbell.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And Nike knows how to get

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
your pace and distance from just that sensor.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
This is the strap

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that people use to transmit heart-rate data

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
to their Nike+ system.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
This is a beautiful, new device

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that gives you detailed sleep tracking data,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep --

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
The rest of it is the bedside console;

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I mean, really until now.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And this is the sleep tracking system of today.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
This just was presented

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
at a health care conference in D.C.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
but the top is a very small GPS transceiver,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
which gives you the date and location

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of an asthma incident,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
giving you a new awareness

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
of your vulnerability

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in relation to time and environmental factors.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Now, we know that new tools

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
are changing our sense of self in the world --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
these tiny sensors that gather data in nature,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
the ubiquitous computing

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
that allows that data to be understood and used,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and of course the social networks

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that allow people to collaborate and contribute.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But we think of these tools as pointing outward,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
as windows

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and I'd just like to invite you to think of them

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
as also turning inward

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and becoming mirrors.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So that when we think about using them

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to get some systematic improvement,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Here's a biometric device:

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
a pair of Apple Earbuds.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Last year, Apple filed some patents

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
to get blood oxygenation,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
What is this for?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
What should it be for?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Some people will say it's for biometric security.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Some people will say it's for public health research.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I'd like to tell you

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that it's also for self-knowledge.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
The self is just our operation center,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
our consciousness,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
our moral compass.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So, if we want to act

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
more effectively in the world,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
we have to get to know ourselves better.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Thank you.
