00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.111
Please meet Jane.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:17.639
She has a high-risk pregnancy.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.420
Within 24 weeks,

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:21.605
she's on bed rest at the hospital,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.456
being monitored
for her preterm contractions.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.918
She doesn't look the happiest.

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:30.163
That's in part because it requires
technicians and experts

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:34.502
to apply these clunky belts on her
to monitor her uterine contractions.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
Another reason Jane is not so happy
is because she's worried.

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:43.394
In particular, she's worried
about what happens

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.823
after her 10-day stay
on bed rest at the hospital.

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.508
What happens when she's home?

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:53.261
If she were to give birth this early
it would be devastating.

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:55.628
As an African-American woman,

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:58.734
she's twice as likely
to have a premature birth

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.949
or to have a stillbirth.

00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.529
So Jane basically has one of two options:

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.578
stay at the hospital on bed rest,

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:10.695
a prisoner to the technology
until she gives birth,

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.409
and then spend the rest
of her life paying for the bill;

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:19.554
or head home after her 10-day stay
and hope for the best.

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:23.293
Neither of these two options
seems appealing.

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:26.243
As I began to think
about stories like this

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:28.053
and hear about stories like this,

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.170
I began to ask myself and imagine:

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:31.736
Is there an alternative?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.496
Is there a way we could have
the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.319
that we get with our trusted
partners in the hospital

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:41.702
while someone is at home
living their daily life?

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.327
With that in mind,

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.298
I encouraged people in my research group

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:49.830
to partner with some
clever material scientists,

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:52.261
and all of us came together
and brainstormed.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.345
And after a long process,

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.763
we came up with a vision, an idea,

00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:00.565
of a wearable system that perhaps
you could wear like a piece of jewelry

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:03.045
or you could apply
to yourself like a Band-Aid.

00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:07.646
And after many trials and tribulations
and years of endeavors,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.397
we were able to come up
with this flexible electronic patch

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.816
that was manufactured
using the same processes

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.521
that they use to build computer chips,

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:20.977
except the electronics are transferred
from a semiconductor wafer

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.269
onto a flexible material
that can interface with the human body.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.823
These systems are about
the thickness of a human hair.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.259
They can measure the types
of information that we want,

00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:35.127
things such as:

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.324
bodily movement,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.074
bodily temperature,

00:02:38.098 --> 00:02:39.903
electrical rhythms of the body

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.085
and so forth.

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:43.377
We can also engineer these systems,

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:46.291
so they can integrate energy sources,

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:49.842
and can have wireless
transmission capabilities.

00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:54.529
So as we began to build
these types of systems,

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:58.891
we began to test them on ourselves
in our research group.

00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:02.279
But in addition, we began to reach out
to some of our clinical partners

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:03.458
in San Diego,

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:07.182
and test these on different patients
in different clinical conditions,

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.903
including moms-to-be like Jane.

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:15.511
Here is a picture of a pregnant woman
in labor at our university hospital

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:20.466
being monitored for her uterine
contractions with the conventional belt.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.090
In addition,

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.706
our flexible electronic patches are there.

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:29.544
This picture demonstrates waveforms
pertaining to the fetal heart rate,

00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:32.485
where the red corresponds
to what was acquired

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.088
with the conventional belts,

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:36.770
and the blue corresponds to our estimates

00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:40.482
using our flexible electronic systems
and our algorithms.

00:03:40.932 --> 00:03:42.380
At this moment,

00:03:42.404 --> 00:03:45.022
we gave ourselves a big mental high five.

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.915
Some of the things we had imagined
were beginning to come to fruition,

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.616
and we were actually seeing this
in a clinical context.

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:53.523
But there was still a problem.

00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:57.335
The problem was, the way
we manufactured these systems

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.816
was very inefficient,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.997
had low yield

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:01.365
and was very error-prone.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.256
In addition,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.752
as we talked to some
of the nurses in the hospital,

00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:07.966
they encouraged us to make sure

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.003
that our electronics worked
with typical medical adhesives

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:13.484
that are used in a hospital.

00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:16.431
We had an epiphany and said,
"Wait a minute.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.669
Rather than just making
them work with adhesives,

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:22.721
let's integrate them into adhesives,

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:25.697
and that could solve
our manufacturing problem."

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.260
This picture that you see here

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.779
is our ability to embed these censors
inside of a piece of Scotch tape

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:35.519
by simply peeling it off of a wafer.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.624
Ongoing work in our research group
allows us to, in addition,

00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:43.357
embed integrated circuits
into the flexible adhesives

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:47.071
to do things like amplifying signals
and digitizing them,

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:48.273
processing them

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.560
and encoding for wireless transmission.

00:04:51.113 --> 00:04:55.015
All of this integrated
into the same medical adhesives

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.849
that are used in the hospital.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.302
So when we reached this point,

00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.750
we had some other challenges,

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:05.089
from both an engineering
as well as a usability perspective,

00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:07.936
to make sure that we could
make it used practically.

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:11.694
In many digital health discussions,

00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:16.665
people believe in and embrace the idea
that we can simply digitize the data,

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.269
wirelessly transmit it,

00:05:18.293 --> 00:05:19.767
send it to the cloud,

00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:20.988
and in the cloud,

00:05:21.012 --> 00:05:23.745
we can extract meaningful
information for interpretation.

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:26.624
And indeed, you can do all of that,

00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:29.637
if you're not worried
about some of the energy challenges.

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.324
Think about Jane for a moment.

00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:33.152
She doesn't live in Palo Alto,

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:34.889
nor does she live in Beverly Hills.

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:36.517
What that means is,

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.871
we have to be mindful about her data plan
and how much it would cost

00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:43.514
for her to be sending out
a continuous stream of data.

00:05:44.383 --> 00:05:45.662
There's another challenge

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:49.384
that not everyone in the medical
profession is comfortable talking about.

00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:52.236
And that is, that Jane
does not have the most trust

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.745
in the medical establishment.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.599
She, people like her, her ancestors,
have not had the best experiences

00:05:59.623 --> 00:06:02.619
at the hands of doctors and the hospital

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:04.551
or insurance companies.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:08.807
That means that we have to be mindful
of questions of privacy.

00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:10.452
Jane might not feel that happy

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:13.755
about all that data
being processed into the cloud.

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:16.708
And Jane cannot be fooled;

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:18.830
she reads the news.

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:21.824
She knows that if the federal
government can be hacked,

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.849
if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:25.920
so can her doctor.

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:28.749
And so with that in mind,

00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:29.969
we had an epiphany.

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.588
We cannot outsmart
all the hackers in the world,

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:36.379
but perhaps we can present
them a smaller target.

00:06:36.986 --> 00:06:39.167
What if we could actually,

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:43.123
rather than have those algorithms
that do data interpretation

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:44.360
run in the cloud,

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.315
what if we have those algorithms run
on those small integrated circuits

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:50.419
embedded into those adhesives?

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:54.089
And so when we integrate
these things together,

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:57.617
what this means is that now
we can think about the future

00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:01.706
where someone like Jane can still
go about living her normal daily life,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.202
she can be monitored,

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:06.726
it can be done in a way where
she doesn't have to get another job

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.215
to pay her data plan,

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:11.934
and we can also address
some of her concerns about privacy.

00:07:12.907 --> 00:07:14.057
So at this point,

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:16.085
we're feeling very good about ourselves.

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:17.272
We've accomplished this,

00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:20.466
we've begun to address some
of these questions about privacy

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.381
and we feel like, pretty much
the chapter is closed now.

00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:27.079
Everyone lived happily ever after, right?

00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.314
Well, not so fast.

00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:31.543
(Laughter)

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:34.607
One of the things we have to remember,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:38.012
is that Jane does not have the most trust
in the medical establishment.

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:39.199
We have to remember

00:07:39.223 --> 00:07:42.737
that there are increasing
and widening health disparities,

00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:46.065
and there's inequity in terms
of proper care management.

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:49.110
And so what that means
is that this simple picture

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:50.779
of Jane and her data --

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:54.730
even with her being comfortable
being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,

00:07:54.754 --> 00:07:57.069
letting a doctor intervene if necessary --

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:58.559
is not the whole story.

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.485
So what we're beginning to do

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:05.336
is to think about ways to have
trusted parties serve as intermediaries

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.778
between people like Jane
and her health care providers.

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:11.813
For example, we've begun
to partner with churches

00:08:11.837 --> 00:08:14.694
and to think about nurses
that are church members,

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:16.740
that come from that trusted community,

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:20.687
as patient advocates and health coaches
to people like Jane.

00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:23.469
Another thing we have going for us

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:25.529
is that insurance companies, increasingly,

00:08:25.553 --> 00:08:27.511
are attracted to some of these ideas.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.613
They're increasingly realizing

00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:32.577
that perhaps it's better
to pay one dollar now

00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:35.584
for a wearable device and a health coach,

00:08:35.608 --> 00:08:37.774
rather than paying 10 dollars later,

00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:40.807
when that baby is born prematurely

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:43.772
and ends up in the neonatal
intensive care unit --

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:46.691
one of the most expensive
parts of a hospital.

00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:50.118
This has been a long
learning process for us.

00:08:50.593 --> 00:08:54.428
This iterative process of breaking
through and attacking one problem

00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:56.223
and not feeling totally comfortable,

00:08:56.247 --> 00:08:58.066
and identifying the next problem,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.147
has helped us go along this path

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:03.247
of actually trying to not only
innovate with this technology

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:07.223
but make sure it can be used for people
who perhaps need it the most.

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:10.493
Another learning lesson
we've taken from this process

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:11.896
that is very humbling,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.247
is that as technology progresses
and advances at an accelerating rate,

00:09:16.271 --> 00:09:20.213
we have to remember that human beings
are using this technology,

00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:21.839
and we have to be mindful

00:09:21.863 --> 00:09:25.303
that these human beings --
they have a face,

00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:26.589
they have a name

00:09:26.613 --> 00:09:27.774
and a life.

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:29.409
And in the case of Jane,

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:30.889
hopefully, two.

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.235
Thank you.

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:38.497
(Applause)
