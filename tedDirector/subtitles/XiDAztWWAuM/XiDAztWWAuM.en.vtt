00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.143
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.431
like all of you.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.764
And I'm also a social justice comedian,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.103
something that I insist is an actual job.

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:26.794
To explain what that is,
let me tell you how I got here.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.573
I've performed all over the country.

00:00:28.597 --> 00:00:30.894
And let me tell you,
America is majestic, right?

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:32.643
It's got breathtaking nature,

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.817
waffle houses

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:35.824
and diabetes as far as the eye can see.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.760
It is really something.

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.023
Now, the American population
can be broken up

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:41.588
into three main categories:

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:43.350
there's mostly wonderful people,

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:44.525
haters

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:45.700
and Florida.

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:47.307
(Laughter)

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.645
Besides Florida, the most troubling
category here are the Haters.

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.858
They are a minority,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:55.385
but they overcompensate
by being extra loud.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.718
They have the Napoleon complex
of demographics,

00:00:57.742 --> 00:00:59.810
and yes, some of the men do wear heels.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.937
As a social justice comedian,

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.829
it's my goal to convert these haters,

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.059
because they hate a lot of things,
which leads to negative outcomes,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:10.694
like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.282
This is not an exhaustive list;

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.980
I'm probably missing 3-7 items.

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:16.226
But the point is,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.979
we have to reckon with the haters.

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:19.814
But there's variance within this group

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:22.859
and it's not efficient to go
after all of them, right?

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:26.396
So what I've done is created
a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.143
I basically took all of the haters,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:31.013
I put them in a petri dish,
like a scientist,

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:32.496
and this is what I found.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.671
(Laughter)

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.989
First off, we have the trolls.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.396
These are your garden-variety
digital haters.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.286
They're the people who quit their jobs

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.424
so they can post on YouTube
videos all day long.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:46.109
There's also the drive-by haters.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.425
Now, these people will be at a stoplight,

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.418
they'll wait for the light to turn green

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.264
and when it does, they yell,
"Go back to your own country!"

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:56.505
Now back in the day, they would've
actually gotten out of their cars

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:57.821
and hated you to your face.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.223
But they just don't make them
like they used to --

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:02.532
which is another sign
of the decline in America.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.730
(Laughter)

00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:05.444
The next category

00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:08.111
is the mission-oriented-bigot-
whose-group-affiliation-

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:09.803
gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:13.365
These guys like to hate
via a seemingly nice organization,

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.562
like a church or a nonprofit,

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:18.300
and they oftentimes like to speak
in an old-timey voice.

00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:22.864
But the group I'm most
interested in is the swing hater.

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:26.475
The swing hater is sister
to the swing voter --

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.228
they just can't decide!

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:30.130
They're like ideological sluts

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:32.144
who move from hating to not hating.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.923
And they do it because they don't have
enough information.

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:37.925
This is the group I like to target
with social justice comedy.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.259
Why comedy?

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:41.812
Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:45.534
the average American prefers comedy,
as you can see from this graph.

00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:46.709
(Laughter)

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.093
Comedy is very popular.

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:49.268
And by the way,

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.238
this is a mathematically accurate graph,

00:02:51.262 --> 00:02:52.786
generated from fake numbers.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.287
(Laughter)

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.496
Now, the question is:

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.305
Why does social justice comedy work?

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.028
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:04.214
And when you're laughing,
you enter into a state of openness.

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:05.796
And in that moment of openness,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.484
a good social justice comedian
can stick in a whole bunch of information,

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.038
and if they're really skilled,

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:12.213
a rectal exam.

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:14.770
(Laughter)

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.995
Here are some ground rules
for social justice comedy:

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.978
first off, it's not partisan.

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.543
This isn't political comedy,
this is about justice,

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:24.264
and no one is against justice.

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.281
Two, it's inviting and warm,

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.066
it makes you feel like you're sitting
inside of a burrito.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.495
Three, it's funny but sneaky,

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.315
like you could be hearing
an interesting treatise

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.553
on income inequality,

00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:38.491
that's encased in a really
sophisticated poop joke.

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.134
(Laughter)

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:43.181
Here's how I see
social justice comedy working.

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:46.503
A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch
of Muslim-American comedians --

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.693
in a non-violent way --

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:49.241
(Laughter)

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:50.737
And we went around the country

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:53.698
to places like Alabama, Arizona,
Tennessee, Georgia --

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:55.921
places where they love the Muzzies --

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.633
and we did stand-up shows.

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:00.971
We called the tour
"The Muslims Are Coming!"

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.260
(Laughter)

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:04.990
We turned this into a movie,

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:07.238
and then after the movie came out,

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:10.665
a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.810
on an anti-Muslim poster campaign

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.705
with the MTA -- that's
the New York City subway system.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.575
Now, the posters were truly offensive,

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.360
not to mentioned poorly designed --

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.218
I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,

00:04:21.242 --> 00:04:22.994
you might as well use a better font.

00:04:23.018 --> 00:04:24.019
(Laughter)

00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:27.995
But we decided, why not launch
our own poster campaign

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:29.893
that says nice things about Muslims,

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:31.164
while promoting the movie.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.313
So myself and fellow comedian
Dean Obeidallah

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:36.833
decided to launch the fighting-bigotry-
with-delightful-posters campaign.

00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:40.607
We raised the money, worked
with the MTA for over 5 months,

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:41.942
got the posters approved,

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.845
and two days after they
were supposed to go up,

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:48.016
the MTA decided to ban the posters,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.876
citing political content.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.133
Let's take a look
at a couple of those posters.

00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:53.451
Here's one.

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:54.689
Facts about Muslims:

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:56.810
Muslims invented
the concept of a hospital.

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:57.985
OK.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.016
Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do
more push-ups than baby Muslims.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.579
(Laughter)

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.451
Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:07.554
(Laughter)

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.460
Let's take a look at another one.

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:10.913
The ugly truth about Muslims:

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:13.525
they have great frittata recipes.

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:18.056
Now clearly, frittatas are considered
political by the MTA.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.537
Either that, or the mere mention
of Muslims in a positive light

00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:23.585
was considered political -- but it isn't.

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:24.862
It's about justice.

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.045
So we decided to change

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.677
our fighting-bigortry-
with-delightful-posters campaign

00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:32.180
and turn it into the fighting-bigotry-
with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.

00:05:32.224 --> 00:05:33.839
(Laughter)

00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:36.827
So basically, what I'm saying
is a couple of dirt-bag comedians

00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:39.382
took on a major New York City agency

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:40.946
and the comedians won.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.546
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.721
Thank you.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.468
Victory was a very weird feeling.

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:49.428
I was like, "Is this what
blonde girls feel like all the time?

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:50.771
'Cause this is amazing!"

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:52.795
(Laughter)

00:05:53.702 --> 00:05:55.193
Here's another example.

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.228
I'm asked everywhere I go:
"Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"

00:05:59.252 --> 00:06:01.443
We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:04.113
So I decided to launch
thedailydenouncer.com.

00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:07.097
It's a website that denounces
terrorism every day of the week,

00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:08.602
while taking the weekends off.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:10.984
Let's take a look at an example.

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.405
They generally appear
as single-panel cartoons,

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.848
"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce
people who never fill the paper tray!"

00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:20.687
The point of the website
is that it denounces terrorism

00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:22.847
while recognizing that it's ridiculous

00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:25.632
that we have to constantly
denounce terrorism.

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.907
But if bigotry isn't your thing,

00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:31.322
social justice comedy is useful
for all sorts of issues.

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:34.237
For example, myself and fellow
comedian Lee Camp

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.726
went to the Cayman Islands
to investigate offshore banking.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.655
Now, the United States loses
something like 300 billion dollars a year

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:44.504
in these offshore tax havens.

00:06:44.528 --> 00:06:45.782
Not to brag,

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.274
but at the end of every month,

00:06:47.298 --> 00:06:49.942
I have something like 5-15 dollars
in disposable income.

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:52.438
So we walked into these banks
in the Cayman Islands

00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:54.618
and asked if we could
open up a bank account

00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:56.688
with eight dollars and 27 cents.

00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:58.515
(Laughter)

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:03.970
The bank managers would indulge us
for 30-45 seconds before calling security.

00:07:03.994 --> 00:07:06.566
Security would come out,
brandish their weapons,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.360
and then we would squeal
with fear and run away,

00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:12.413
because -- and this is the last
rule of social justice comedy --

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:15.151
sometimes it makes you want
to take a dump in your pants.

00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:18.022
Most of my work is meant to be fun.

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:21.133
It's meant to generate
a connection and laughter.

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:24.489
But yes, sometimes I get
run off the grounds by security.

00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:27.480
Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:32.379
Sometimes I get voice mails saying
that if I continue telling my jokes,

00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:35.465
they'll kill me
and they'll kill my family.

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:39.263
And those death threats
are definitely not funny.

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:41.421
But despite the occasional danger,

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:45.345
I still think that social justice comedy
is one of our best weapons.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.424
I mean, we've tried
a lot of approaches to social justice,

00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:50.970
like war and competitive ice dancing.

00:07:50.994 --> 00:07:54.844
But still, a lot of things
are still kind of awful.

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:58.507
So I think it's time we try and tell
a really good poop joke.

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:00.184
Thank you.

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:04.500
(Applause)
