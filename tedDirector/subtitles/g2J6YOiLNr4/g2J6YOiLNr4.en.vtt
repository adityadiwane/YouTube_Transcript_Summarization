00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
My story is a little bit about war.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
It's about disillusionment.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It's about death.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And it's about rediscovering

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
idealism

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
in all of that wreckage.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And perhaps also, there's a lesson

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
about how to deal with

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
our screwed-up, fragmenting

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and dangerous world of the 21st century.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I don't believe in a life or history

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
led to consequence "C" --

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
these neat narratives that we're presented with,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and that perhaps we encourage in each other.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I believe in randomness,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and one of the reasons I believe that

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
is because me becoming a diplomat was random.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I'm colorblind.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I was born unable to see most colors.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and I have to take my wife with me

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
to chose clothes.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I loved watching planes barrel over

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
our holiday home in the countryside.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and sure enough, I failed.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and I can't distinguish color.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
So I had to choose another career,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and this was in fact relatively easy for me,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which was international relations.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
As a child,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I read the newspaper thoroughly.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I was fascinated by the Cold War,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
by the INF negotiations

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in Angola or Afghanistan.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
These things really interested me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And so I decided quite at an early age

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I wanted to be a diplomat.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and my father denies this story to this day --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And he turned to me, and he said,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
(Laughter)

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And my ambition was sealed.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
In 1989,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
I entered the British Foreign Service.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and 20 of us succeeded.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And as those numbers suggest,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I was inducted into an elite

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and fascinating and exhilarating world.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Being a diplomat, then and now,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I enjoyed the status of it.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and reveled in

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
this amazing access I had to world events.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
in the British Foreign Ministry.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I became a speechwriter

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
for the British Foreign Secretary.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
I met Yasser Arafat.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I negotiated

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Later, I traveled to Kabul

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And I would travel

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in a C-130 transport

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and go and visit warlords

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
in mountain hideaways

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and negotiate with them

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
surrounded by my Special Forces escort,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
because it was so dangerous.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And that was exciting -- that was fun.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
It was really interesting.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And it's a great cadre of people,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
incredibly close-knit community of people.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
was when I was posted to New York.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I'd already served in Germany, Norway,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
various other places,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but I was posted to New York

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And my responsibility was the Middle East,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which was my specialty.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And there, I dealt with things

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
like the Middle East peace process,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
the Lockerbie issue --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
we can talk about that later, if you wish --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
but above all, my responsibility was Iraq

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and its weapons of mass destruction

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and the sanctions we placed on Iraq

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I was the chief British negotiator

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
on the subject,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and I was steeped in the issue.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And anyway,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
We went through several wars

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
during my time in New York.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I negotiated for my country

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the resolution in the Security Council

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
of the 12th of September 2001

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
condemning the attacks of the day before,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
which were, of course, deeply present to us

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
actually living in New York at the time.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
kind of experience.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
I lived the high-life.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Although I worked very long hours,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
you can imagine what that might have meant.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Laughter)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
I had a good time.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But in 2002,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
when my tour came to an end,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I decided I wasn't going to go back

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to the job that was waiting for me in London.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I decided to take a sabbatical,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
in fact, at the New School, Bruce.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
In some inchoate, inarticulate way

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
I realized that there was something wrong

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
with my work, with me.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I was exhausted,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and I was also disillusioned

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And I decided to take some time out from work.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The Foreign Office was very generous.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
It was nice.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And eventually, I decided

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
which was then under U.N. administration.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And two things happened in Kosovo,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
which kind of, again,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
shows the randomness of life,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
because these things turned out to be

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
two of the pivots of my life

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
But they were random things.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
One was that, in the summer of 2004,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
the British government, somewhat reluctantly,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
decided to have an official inquiry

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
into the use of intelligence on WMD

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
in the run up to the Iraq War,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
a very limited subject.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and its WMD,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
that the government exaggerated the intelligence,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that Iraq's WMD

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
which in some ways

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
was a more discreditable thing still.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The third reason, I won't go into.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
But anyway, I gave that testimony,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and that presented me with a crisis.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
What was I going to do?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
of my ministers, who had, in my view

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And so I was in crisis.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And this wasn't a pretty thing.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
I moaned about it, I hesitated,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
where he goes back to CBS

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
I felt just something's broken.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and do what I used to do gladly for them.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
So took a running leap

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and jumped over the edge of a cliff.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And I started to fall.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And today, that fall hasn't stopped;

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
I'm still falling.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And in a way, I kind of like

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
the sensation of it a lot better

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
wondering what to do.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
which kind of delivered the answer,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
which I couldn't really answer,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
which is, "What do I do with my life?"

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I love diplomacy --

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I have no career --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I wanted to be an ambassador,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and my mentors, my heroes,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
people who got to the top of my profession,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and here I was throwing it all away.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
A lot of my friends were still in it.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
My pension was in it.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And I gave it up.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And what was I going to do?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And that year, in Kosovo,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
In March 2004, there were terrible riots

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
18 people were killed.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
It was anarchy.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to know that the police and the military --

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
there were lots of military troops there --

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
actually can't stop that rampaging mob

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
who's coming down the street.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
is when they decide to stop

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and when they've had enough burning and killing.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And that riot taught me something,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
But one of the reasons that riot took place --

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
those riots, which went on for several days, took place --

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
was because the Kosovo people

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
were disenfranchised from their own future.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
going on then,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
were not actually

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
participating in those talks.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and the Kosovars weren't part of it.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
It wasn't the only reason,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and life is not simple, one reason narratives.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
It was a complicated thing,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
But that was one of the reasons.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And that kind of gave me the inspiration --

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
or rather to be precise,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
it gave my wife the inspiration.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
They were not allowed diplomats.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
They were not allowed a foreign office

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And so that was the idea.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
the world's first diplomatic advisory group

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and a non-profit to boot.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And it began when I flew back from London

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
"Yes, Carne. Come."

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And I came to Kosovo

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and advised the Kosovo government.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And Kosovo became independent.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Independent Diplomat is now established

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in five diplomatic centers around the world,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and we're advising seven or eight

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
different countries, or political groups,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
depending on how you wish to define them --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and I'm not big on definitions.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
We're advising the Burmese opposition,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
the government of Southern Sudan,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
which -- you heard it here first --

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
is going to be a new country within the next few years.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
who are fighting to get their country back

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
from Moroccan occupation

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
after 34 years of dispossession.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
which is suppose to culminate

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
in Copenhagen.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
There's a bit of randomness here too

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I went to a party in the House of Lords,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
which is a ridiculous place,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
this guy who was standing behind me.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And we started talking, and he said --

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
I told him what I was doing,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and I told him rather grandly

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
At that time there was just me --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and me and my wife were moving back to New York.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And it turned out

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
which some of you have probably heard of.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And one thing led to another,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and I ended up having a desk

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
in ?What If! in New York,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
when I started Independent Diplomat.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And watching ?What If!

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
or new flavors for Coke

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
actually helped me innovate

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
new strategies for the Kosovars

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
that diplomacy, like business,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
is a business of solving problems,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
it's all zero sum games and realpolitik

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and ancient institutions that have been there for generations

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and do things the same way they've always done things.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And Independent Diplomat, today,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And we use naive experts

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
but may know something about something else

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
to try to inject new thinking

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
into the problems

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
that we try to address for our clients.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
are having a difficult time, diplomatically.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
There are, I don't know,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
some lessons from all of this,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
personal and political --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and in a way, they're the same thing.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
The personal one

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
is falling off a cliff

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
just to tear everything up and jump.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
which is emerging and evident across the world,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
which is that the world is fragmenting.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
States mean less than they used to,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and the power of the state is declining.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
That means the power of others things is rising.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Those other things are called non-state actors.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
They may be corporations,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
they may anything,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
any number of things.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
If governments are less able

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
to affect the problems

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
that affect us in the world,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
then that means, who is left to deal with them,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Us.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
What this means is

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
it's no longer good enough

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to say that international relations, or global affairs,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
or chaos in Somalia,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
I can connect any one of you

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
by six degrees of separation

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
but that connection is there.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
We are all intimately connected.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
it's actually provable in case after case after case.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
you have to look to yourself to do things.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
in a sort of loose way.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
the way the world is changing

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
the U.N. Security Council.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
The U.N. was established in 1945.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
Its charter is basically designed

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to stop conflicts between states --

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
interstate conflict.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
Today, 80 percent of the agenda

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
of the U.N. Security Council

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
is about conflicts within states,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
involving non-state parties --

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
guerillas, separatists,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
terrorists, if you want to call them that,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
That is the state of the world today.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
When I realized this,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
and when I look back on my time at the Security Council

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and what happened with the Kosovars,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and I realize that often

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
the people who were most directly affected

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
by what we were doing in the Security Council

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
weren't actually there, weren't actually invited

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
to give their views to the Security Council,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
I thought, this is wrong.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
Something's got to be done about this.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
So I started off in a traditional mode.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
went around the U.N. Security Council.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
We went around 70 U.N. member states --

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis --

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
you name them, we went to see them --

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
the secretary general, all of them,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and said, "This is all wrong.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
You've got to institutionalize a system

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
where you actually invite the Kosovars

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
to come and tell you what they think.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Super-logical, you would think.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
Come back to us

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
in maybe six months."

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
The Security Council does its business

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
in exactly the same way today

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
that it did X number of years ago,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
when I was there 10 years ago.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
So we looked at that observation

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
of basically failure

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
and thought, what can we do about it.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
And I thought, I'm buggered

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
if I'm going to spend the rest of my life

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
lobbying for these crummy governments

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
to do what needs to be done.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
So what we're going to do

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
So now, Independent Diplomat

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
is in the process of setting up meetings

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
between the U.N. Security Council

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
and the parties to the disputes

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
that are on the agenda of the Security Council.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
So we will be bringing

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
Darfuri rebel groups,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
rebels from Aceh,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
and awful long laundry list

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
of chaotic conflicts around the world.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
to sit down in a quiet room

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.260
in a private setting with no press

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
and actually explain what they want

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
to the members of the U. N. Security Council,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
and for the members of the U.N. Security Council

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
to explain to them what they want.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
So there's actually a conversation,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
which has never before happened.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
And of course, describing all this,

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
and I entirely agree with you.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.260
The chances of failure are very high,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
but it certainly won't happen

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.260
if we don't try to make it happen.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
And my politics has changed fundamentally

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.260
and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.260
not technology, frankly, so much either.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
Preach technology

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.260
to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.260
who are now in political prison in Tehran,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
where Ahmadinejad remains in power.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.260
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.260
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.260
"What can I do to produce that particular output?"

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.260
That is the politics of the 21st century,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
and in a way, Independent Diplomat

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
embodies that fragmentation, that change,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.260
that is happening to all of us.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260
That's my story. Thanks.
