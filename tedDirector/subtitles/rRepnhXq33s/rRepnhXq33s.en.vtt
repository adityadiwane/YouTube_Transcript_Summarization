00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.626
Over the next five minutes,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.299
my intention is to transform
your relationship with sound.

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:22.898
Let me start with the observation

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.140
that most of the sound
around us is accidental;

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:27.278
much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:30.065
We stand on street corners,
shouting over noise like this,

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.465
pretending it doesn't exist.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.466
This habit of suppressing sound has meant

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.838
that our relationship with sound
has become largely unconscious.

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.839
There are four major ways
sound is affecting you all the time,

00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:42.458
and I'd like to raise them
in your consciousness today.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.103
The first is physiological.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.997
(Alarm clocks ring)

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:48.177
Sorry about that.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.124
I just gave you a shot of cortisol,
your fight-flight hormone.

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.902
Sounds are affecting
your hormone secretions all the time,

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:57.166
but also your breathing, heart rate --
which I just also did --

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.615
and your brainwaves.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.142
It's not just unpleasant sounds
like that that do it.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.475
This is surf. (Ocean waves)

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.992
It has the frequency of roughly
12 cycles per minute.

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:06.765
Most people find that very soothing,

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.885
and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute
is roughly the frequency

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.688
of the breathing of a sleeping human,

00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:14.029
so there is a deep resonance
with being at rest.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.358
We also associate it
with being stress-free and on holiday.

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:20.725
The second way in which sound
affects you is psychological.

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.234
Music is the most powerful form
of sound that we know

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:25.767
that affects our emotional state.
(Albinoni's Adagio)

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.236
This is guaranteed to make most of you
feel pretty sad if I leave it on.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.737
Music is not the only kind of sound,
however, which affects your emotions.

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:34.595
Natural sound can do that, too.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.236
Birdsong, for example, is a sound
which most people find reassuring.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.771
There's a reason:
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:43.764
we've learned that when the birds
are singing, things are safe.

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:45.793
It's when they stop
you need to be worried.

00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:48.445
The third way in which
sound affects you is cognitively.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.306
You can't understand two people
talking at once (Voice-over)

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.375
or in this case, one person talking twice.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.953
You have to choose which me
you're going to listen to.

00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:59.341
We have a very small amount of bandwidth
for processing auditory input,

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:00.925
which is why noise like this ...

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:01.964
(Office noise)

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.874
is extremely damaging for productivity.

00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:06.407
If you have to work
in an open-plan office like this,

00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:08.236
your productivity is greatly reduced.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.737
And whatever number you're thinking of,
it probably isn't as bad as this.

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:15.310
[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.951
You are one-third as productive
in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:20.126
I have a tip for you:

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.935
if you work in spaces like that,
carry headphones with you,

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.697
with a soothing sound like birdsong.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.305
Put them on, and your productivity
goes back up to triple what it would be.

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.559
The fourth way in which
sound affects us is behaviorally.

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.268
With all that other stuff going on,

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.655
it would be amazing
if our behavior didn't change.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.688
(Techno music)

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:39.131
So ask yourself: Is this person
ever going to drive

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:40.629
at a steady 28 miles per hour?

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:41.804
I don't think so.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.737
At the simplest, you move
away from unpleasant sound

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.196
and towards pleasant sounds.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.657
So if I were to play this ...

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:48.898
(Jackhammer)

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:51.494
for more than a few seconds,
you'd feel uncomfortable;

00:02:51.518 --> 00:02:54.583
for more than a few minutes,
you'd be leaving the room in droves.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.011
For people who can't get away
from noise like that,

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.012
it's extremely damaging for their health.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:01.545
And that's not the only thing
that bad sound damages.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.864
Most retail sound is inappropriate
and accidental, even hostile,

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:06.988
and it has a dramatic effect on sales.

00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:10.400
For you retailers, you may want
to look away before I show this slide.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.756
[Inappropriate retail soundscapes
sales down 28%]

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.185
They're losing up to 30 percent
of their business

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.467
with people leaving shops faster,
or just turning around at the door.

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.084
We've all done it, left the area,

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:22.118
because the sound in there is so dreadful.

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:25.485
I want to spend just a moment
talking about the model we've developed,

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.773
which allows us to start at the top
and look at the drivers of sound,

00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:29.964
analyze the soundscape

00:03:29.988 --> 00:03:32.605
and then predict the four outcomes
I just talked about.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.499
Or start at the bottom
and say what outcomes we want,

00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:38.088
and then design a soundscape
to have a desired effect.

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:40.213
At last we've got
some science we can apply.

00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:42.648
And we're in the business
of designing soundscapes.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:43.949
Just a word on music.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.620
Music is the most powerful sound there is,
often inappropriately deployed.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.129
It's powerful for two reasons:

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:52.236
you recognize it fast,
and you associate it very powerfully.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.854
I'll give you two examples.

00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:55.748
(First chord of "A Hard Day's Night")

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:57.678
Most of you recognize that immediately.

00:03:57.702 --> 00:03:58.853
The younger, maybe not.

00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:00.085
(Laughter)

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.505
(First notes of "Jaws" theme)

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.612
Most of you associate that with something!

00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:05.761
Now, those are one-second
samples of music.

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:06.937
Music is very powerful,

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:10.823
and unfortunately, it's veneering
commercial spaces, often inappropriately.

00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:13.753
I hope that's going to change
over the next few years.

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:16.973
Let me talk about brands for a moment,
since some of you run brands.

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:19.261
Every brand is out there
making sound right now.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.642
There are eight expressions of a brand
in sound; they're all important.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.286
And every brand needs to have
guidelines at the center.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.569
I'm glad to say
that is starting to happen now.

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.171
(Intel ad jingle)

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:30.760
You all recognize that one.

00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:31.791
(Nokia ringtone)

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:34.307
This is the most-played tune
in the world today --

00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:36.539
1.8 billion times a day,
that tune is played.

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:37.619
(Laughter)

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.001
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:43.577
I'll leave you with four golden rules,
for those of you who run businesses,

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.757
for commercial sound.

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:46.236
First, make it congruent,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.387
pointing in the same direction
as your visual communication.

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.045
That increases impact
by over 1,100 percent.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.236
If your sound is pointing
the opposite direction, incongruent,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.236
you reduce impact by 86 percent.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.946
That's an order of magnitude, up or down.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.454
This is important.

00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.236
Secondly, make it appropriate
to the situation.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.517
Thirdly, make it valuable.

00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:09.009
Give people something with the sound,
don't just bombard them with stuff.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:10.592
Finally, test and test it again.

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:13.400
Sound is complex; there are many
countervailing influences.

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:15.401
It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:

00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:18.057
sometimes you just have to eat it
and see what happens.

00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:20.870
So I hope this talk has raised sound
in your consciousness.

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:22.455
If you're listening consciously,

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.591
you can take control
of the sound around you.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.239
It's good for your health
and for your productivity.

00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:29.056
If we all do that, we move to a state

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.665
that I like to think will be
sound living in the world.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.086
I'll leave you with more birdsong.
(Birds chirping)

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.395
I recommend at least five minutes
a day, but there's no maximum dose.

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.451
Thank you for lending me your ears today.

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:41.561
(Applause)
