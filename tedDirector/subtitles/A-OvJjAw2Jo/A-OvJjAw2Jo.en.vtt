00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:14.738
So this is James Risen.

00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:17.924
You may know him as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:19.640
for The New York Times.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:22.418
Long before anybody knew
Edward Snowden's name,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.358
Risen wrote a book in which
he famously exposed

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.318
that the NSA was illegally wiretapping
the phone calls of Americans.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.612
But it's another chapter in that book

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.651
that may have an even more lasting impact.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:39.223
In it, he describes a catastrophic
US intelligence operation

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:42.336
in which the CIA quite literally
handed over blueprints

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.146
of a nuclear bomb to Iran.

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:46.457
If that sounds crazy, go read it.

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.972
It's an incredible story.

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:50.520
But you know who didn't like that chapter?

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:52.043
The US government.

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:54.806
For nearly a decade afterwards,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.083
Risen was the subject
of a US government investigation

00:00:58.107 --> 00:01:00.476
in which prosecutors demanded
that he testify

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.404
against one of his alleged sources.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.904
And along the way, he became the face
for the US government's recent pattern

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:09.947
of prosecuting whistleblowers
and spying on journalists.

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:12.349
You see, under the First Amendment,

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:16.000
the press has the right to publish
secret information in the public interest.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:21.158
But it's impossible to exercise that right
if the media can't also gather that news

00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:24.438
and protect the identities
of the brave men and women

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:25.612
who get it to them.

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:28.119
So when the government came knocking,

00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:31.184
Risen did what many brave reporters
have done before him:

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.393
he refused

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:34.088
and said he'd rather go to jail.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.594
So from 2007 to 2015,

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:40.412
Risen lived under the specter
of going to federal prison.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:45.023
That is, until just days before the trial,
when a curious thing happened.

00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:49.713
Suddenly, after years of claiming
it was vital to their case,

00:01:49.737 --> 00:01:52.427
the government dropped their demands
to Risen altogether.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.460
It turns out, in the age
of electronic surveillance,

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.372
there are very few places
reporters and sources can hide.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.554
And instead of trying and failing
to have Risen testify,

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:05.625
they could have his digital trail
testify against him instead.

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.101
So completely in secret
and without his consent,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.395
prosecutors got Risen's phone records.

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:16.419
They got his email records,
his financial and banking information,

00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:18.196
his credit reports,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.990
even travel records with a list
of flights he had taken.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.593
And it was among this information that
they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:28.736
Risen's alleged source
and CIA whistleblower.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.450
Sadly, this is only one case of many.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.759
President Obama ran on a promise
to protect whistleblowers,

00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:40.045
and instead, his Justice Department
has prosecuted more

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.560
than all other administrations combined.

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.283
Now, you can see how this
could be a problem,

00:02:45.307 --> 00:02:49.774
especially because the government
considers so much of what it does secret.

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:55.258
Since 9/11, virtually every important
story about national security

00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:58.202
has been the result of a whistleblower
coming to a journalist.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.568
So we risk seeing the press
unable to do their job

00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:03.791
that the First Amendment
is supposed to protect

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:06.822
because of the government's
expanded ability to spy on everyone.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.940
But just as technology has allowed
the government

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:12.671
to circumvent reporters' rights,

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:14.869
the press can also use technology

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:17.233
to protect their sources
even better than before.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:20.810
And they can start from the moment
they begin speaking with them,

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.261
rather than on the witness stand
after the fact.

00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:26.289
Communications software now exists

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:28.845
that wasn't available
when Risen was writing his book,

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.868
and is much more surveillance-resistant
than regular emails or phone calls.

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:38.007
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,

00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:40.716
an open-source whistleblower
submission system

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.788
that was originally created by the late
Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:47.477
and is now developed
at the non-profit where I work,

00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.032
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:51.476
Instead of sending an email,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.541
you go to a news organization's website,

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.565
like this one here on The Washington Post.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.953
From there, you can upload a document
or send information

00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:02.406
much like you would
on any other contact form.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.334
It'll then be encrypted
and stored on a server

00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:07.906
that only the news organization
has access to.

00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.724
So the government can no longer
secretly demand the information,

00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:13.852
and much of the information
they would demand

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:15.835
wouldn't be available in the first place.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.439
SecureDrop, though, is really
only a small part of the puzzle

00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:22.410
for protecting press freedom
in the 21st century.

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.408
Unfortunately, governments
all over the world

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.932
are constantly developing
new spying techniques

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:29.360
that put us all at risk.

00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:32.741
And it's up to us going forward
to make sure

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.265
that it's not just
the tech-savvy whistleblowers,

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.574
like Edward Snowden, who have
an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

00:04:39.408 --> 00:04:44.155
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:47.487
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:49.838
or the next environmental worker

00:04:49.862 --> 00:04:53.060
sounding the alarm
about Flint's dirty water,

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.764
or a Wall Street insider

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.965
warning us of the next financial crisis.

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.997
After all, these tools weren't just built
to help the brave men and women

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.559
who expose crimes,

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:06.817
but are meant to protect
all of our rights under the Constitution.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.611
Thank you.

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:11.944
(Applause)
