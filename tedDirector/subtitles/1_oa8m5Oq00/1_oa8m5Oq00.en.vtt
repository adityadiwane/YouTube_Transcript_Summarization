00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
My favorite topic is

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
shortcuts.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
But I will demonstrate

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
different ways to get

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
rid of difficulties and go to the point,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
to find an answer

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
probably much quicker than Arthur did. So,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
first,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
we violate the common sense,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
90 degrees --

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
all of you. Not you.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
All of you, right? Palm up.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
If you do this,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
Do you agree?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
Good.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
But I will first teach you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.330
a method, how you can do it without

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
moving the wrist, and then the shortcut.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
You can do it immediately, right?

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
Hold the hand like this, palm up.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Don't move the wrist. The wrist is --

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Right-molded you say, with iron?

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
That was a joke, actually,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
and I --

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
OK.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Forward, don't move the wrist.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And forward. Yeah.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
Now --

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
(Laughter) --

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
logic, logically,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.330
(Laughter)

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Now, the shortcut.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
(Laughter)

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
But it was six moves. Now with one move.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
I start here, palm down, you can follow.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
And then look at me.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
Yeah! (Laughter)

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
One move. OK.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
So,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
that was the warming up.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
Now,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I need an assistant.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
She has left. No! A big hand.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
(Applause)

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
One item here was water, right?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And I will give my tribute

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
to water.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about -- cheers.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
(Laughter)

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
Beer has about --

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
there's a lot of water in beer.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
(Laughter)

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
So, now

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
I will demonstrate different ways of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
memorizing,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
control cards and so on.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And I think I'll take off this one.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
I work with a special

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
method to do it, quick.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
I work with

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
precision -- oh, sorry --

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
control

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
a very powerful ...

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
memory system, right?

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.330
(Laughter)

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
So,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
if --

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
I have studied the poker. I like to gamble.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
Officially, I don't gamble but ...

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
So, if we are --

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
if we have five person,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
and I will do a five-handed poker game.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
Now I will interact. So a different person

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
all the time, so not the same person can answer.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
So we have an agreement.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Which one shall have a good poker hand?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Lennart Green: Three -- good.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
And

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
here,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
I had a mat here to make it a little --

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
the critical moment is -- sorry.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
If a card shark gathers the cards together,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
immediately when he --

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
before he deals the card. Now,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
so I think, number three,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
I have arranged them in a full house.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.330
(Laughter)

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
With queens and -- it's OK --

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
queens and tens.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
That's a challenge. I like this.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
I start with three queens.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
And two tens.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
Yeah. Thank you.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
(Applause)

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
So these guys have actually a stronger hand --

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
three aces and two kings.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
This guy beats them with

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
four of a kind, or deuce -- deuce.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
No reaction? That with even --

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
OK, and this.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and ...

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
But, of course, I will have the winning hand.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Ten, jack,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
queen, king, ace.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
Yeah. So,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
good.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.330
(Laughter)

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
So the hand that looks so good from the beginning,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
number three, at the end

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
was actually the lowest hand.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Such life. Right?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
So, please mix them.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
underground techniques.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Yes?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
I work with

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
kind of estimation,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
shuffle tracking --

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
ah, good.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Impressive. Thank you.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
(Laughter)

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
So, first,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
the first term is estimation.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
are put between

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
my royal flush.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Right? You agree.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
So here I have, actually --

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
I know exactly where the cards are.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
So here, I can make a bet,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
So here: 10, jack,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
queen, king, ace.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
OK.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
(Applause)

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
Next

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
is a term --

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
I do it quick. I call this stealing.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
So here, I think

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
I know about where the cards are.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.330
Zoe: Stop.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
LG: Here -- you see some are missing?

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
And that's the stealing cards, which I did.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
(Laughter)

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
OK.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Now, another term called shuffle tracking.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
even if another person shuffles.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
This is a little risky.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
So -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
You agree? But if you square --

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
square, and shuffle,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
and then a cut.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
So here,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
Come to -- no, no, no, no.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
I'm joking, yeah?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
Any style -- yeah, good.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
I work direct with the right brain.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
If you pass the left brain,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
you have to take care of logic and common sense.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so --

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
(Laughter) --

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
Arthur Benjamin did

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
a little of the same thing.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
you have -- that's the password

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
to the

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
cosmic bank of knowledge,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
where you can find any solution of any problem.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
OK. Now, I drop the cards,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
and you say stop anyway, right?

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Not at the last card.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.330
(Laughter)

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
Ah, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
No, I'm kidding.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.330
(Applause)

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
No, now and then I put in a mistake,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
just to emphasize how difficult it is.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Right?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
But now I'm glad I remember it.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
So,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
this deck is bought here. Sorry.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
I have a little pad

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
to make it a little softer.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
This deck is bought here in America.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
It's called

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
but not so many people know,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
if you check, if you press at

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
the right spots,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
Now, you can carry this in your wallet,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
so ...

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
You don't see it, make no reaction?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
(Laughter)

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
So, but here,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
and --

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
is the camera getting too much? No.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.330
(Laughter)

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.330
LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
But not too much.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Then you have to push it down again.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Here, please. If you push these

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
heaps -- everyone see --

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
push them together so they are really interlaced,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
right? Yeah, good.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
Perfect.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
Just push them through, good. Thank you.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
And then, I will demonstrate a thing from

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
Russian satellite,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
stealen -- stolen,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
probably copied from America but we will see.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
Here --

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Now I go very quick

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
through the deck and try to find some pattern.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
The new chaos theory is already old, right?

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
But you know, I think you are

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
familiar with fractals --

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
And it's much

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
easier to memorize cards in a pattern way,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
then you go to --

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
in another language ...

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
Yeah, great.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
I think I have it.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
So now, different persons, older, tap.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
Please name any card, anyone.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Jack of spades.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
nine, 10, 11,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
12. Yes, right.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
So -- oh, jack of spades.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
So, jack of spades.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
I think ...

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
23 --

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
24, sorry, 24.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
23 --

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
ah, 25, yes.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
It's the last.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Now, I do it quicker, better.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
(Laughter)

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
-- actually, my technique is to peek,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
all the time.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
When I lift the heap, I peek.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
You see, yeah, perfect.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate -- yeah, good.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
(Laughter)

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
So I will do it quick,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
(Laughter)

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
Good, thank you.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.330
(Applause)

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
The thing I did -- I peeked.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
I know where the card were,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
then I chose it. So another person, another card.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.330
(Laughter)

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.330
Another person.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.330
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.330
LG: Pardon?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.330
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
I think I do it the same way. I like to,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
so I know where it is.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Ten of diamonds.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.330
But now I do it the regular speed, right?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
Ten of diamonds.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
Good.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
Maybe you will cut? Lift.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
Excellent.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
So, thank you. Another person, another card.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
(Audience: Five of clubs.)

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
Five of clubs.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.330
(Laughter)

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
We do it again.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
The person who said five of clubs say stop,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
when the cards are in the air, right?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.330
(Audience: Stop.)

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
LG: Very good.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
OK.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.330
(Applause)

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
OK, I had to use a little force there.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
I think we save five of clubs.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
Excellent. I love that card.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
Here, I will do the most difficult thing.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
and you're betting,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
and you let the other guys

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
And now, when I lift this card,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
it shall be your card. What was your card?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
(Audience: Queen of hearts.)

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.330
So that's a tough challenge, right?

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.330
So here, I grab --

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
you know this? Five of clubs ...

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
and queen of hearts. Yes!

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
This is a tough one,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
because here I must take advantage of --

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.330
I switch it with the five of clubs.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
So, now

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
a false count.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
Which card shall I use? Queen or five?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.330
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
The false count -- and the number

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
one, two, three,

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.330
four, five, six, seven, eight --

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.330
you say the same card all the time.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Eight, nine, 10.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.330
This is a kind of optical deal, right?

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.330
When I put one card at a table --

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
look, it's not one card. It's -- look,

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
it's a bunch of cards that gives this

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.330
impression.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
Yeah.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
Now some hard stuff.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.330
I think we keep the queen here, yes.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.330
Now, to the satellites things.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
This --

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.330
oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:03.330
(Laughter)

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
This is high-frequency laser,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
and it's enough with a fraction of a second

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
to destroy the retina completely.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
Right, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
But you can relax,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
because it takes half an hour before it works,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.330
(Laughter)

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.330
Now,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.330
I put the laser here,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.330
and --

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.330
now, when I deal the cards in the laser,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330
I know where they are but -- yes?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.330
Did the camera got it?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.330
No?

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.330
They didn't?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.330
What happened?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.330
(Audience: It disappeared.)

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.330
LG: OK, I'll take another group.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.330
Do the cameras see the cards now?

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.330
No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.330
LG: But you see the hand.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.330
Ah, good, good, good. But now.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.330
So now, that was the reason, right?

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.330
You see the cards? Yes.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.330
(Laughter)

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.330
Yeah, good.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
Now --

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
(Laughter)

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.330
-- one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.330
do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.330
(Laughter)

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.330
Yeah, interesting,

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
but a little dangerous.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:38.330
(Laughter)

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.330
I liked it. Now,

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.330
a little more difficult.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.330
Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.330
(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.330
So here,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.330
here I have to peek, lots of cards.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.330
I think there are lots of --

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.330
I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.330
(Laughter)

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.330
So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.330
Then I arrange them so I can

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.330
get them quick.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.330
Perfect, excellent.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.330
So I start with the ace --

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.330
yeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.330
Same mistake as before, right?

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.330
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.330
I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.330
You see, I don't work with prestige,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.330
so always do mistakes.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.330
It doesn't matter to me.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.330
And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.330
One,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.330
two, three, four -- yes,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.330
the camera got it? Five, six,

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.330
seven, eight --

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.330
ah --

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.330
nine, 10,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.330
the jack,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.330
jack of spades,

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.330
queen of --

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.330
I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.330
(Laughter)

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.330
Wait, wait, wait -- please take any card.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.330
Grab any one. Quick, quick, good.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.330
And we switch this to the king.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.330
Ace of diamonds.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.330
And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.330
So I find ...

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.330
king of spades.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.330
There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct?

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.330
Yeah? OK.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.330
(Applause)

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.330
Now, a little more difficult thing.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.330
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.330
so you help me to shuffle again.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.330
Another suit, please.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.330
(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.)

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.330
(Laughter)

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.330
LG: It was after the blindfold.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.330
I like this guy, yeah.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.330
OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.330
Armani -- who said Armani? You?

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.330
I drop the cards and you -- which size?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.330
Which size?

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.330
(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.330
Say stop. (Audience: Stop.)

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.330
(Laughter)

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.330
LG: Yeah, Armani. OK.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:30.330
(Applause)

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.330
Ah, this is tough.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.330
OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.330
Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.330
So, in this case,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.330
I try to

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.330
locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.330
We try. Yeah. You help me.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.330
If I drop the card face up,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.330
like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.330
LG: OK, now.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.330
Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:08.330
(Laughter)

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.330
I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.330
So here,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.330
diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.330
Stop. Do you see the pattern?

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.330
No? Now?

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.330
Yes, yes, OK.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.330
I work with pattern.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.330
Oh sorry, I dropped one.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.330
Maybe it's important --

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.330
yeah --

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.330
nine of diamonds, OK.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.330
So now --

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.330
I always ask,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.330
why do I put myself in this position?

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.330
I have to figure out so many outs,

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.330
when I miss some cards, but

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.330
I love it. So now,

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.330
I will do it. I will try to find

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.330
the diamonds,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.330
but I will do it the hard way.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.330
It's too easy to do it right away, right?

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.330
I think I will do it ...

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.330
blindfolded.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.330
At this distance, it works immediately.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.330
Aargh!

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:28.330
(Laughter)

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.330
Duct tape.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.330
I look -- shake the cards, so I don't.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.330
Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.330
Empathy.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.330
But it was -- did you hear?

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.330
It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.330
(Laughter)

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.330
Yeah, good. Yeah.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.330
You can take the nostril too, because some guys think --

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.330
(Laughter)

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.330
-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.330
more. Go, go.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.330
Right? Good.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.330
Satisfied?

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.330
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.330
(Laughter)

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.330
No, with dignity and elegance, right?

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.330
But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.330
And it was OK. One more?

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.330
The last.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.330
OK.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.330
All right.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.330
Now you must agree that I'm --

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.330
I must rely on other senses, right?

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.330
I work with vibration.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.330
So,

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.330
what was the card?

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.330
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.330
So now I have

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.330
to improvise again.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.330
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.330
Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.330
Just kidding, warming up -- king of hearts.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.330
(Laughter)

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.330
And I give you a diamonds, so they -- so you put them here,

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.330
in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.330
Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.330
LG: Good. Good. Two -- (Applause) --

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.330
thank you.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.330
I never ever miss two. This is interesting.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.330
Always I've found two,

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.330
but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.330
And the deck is a gift to you after,

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.330
so let the skepticals here, in this,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.330
examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.330
Two -- and it was two of spades, right?

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.330
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.330
Three --

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.330
three of diamonds. Yes!

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.330
Four --

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.330
I like challenges, yes.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.330
Yeah, good.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.330
Chris Anderson: You're peeking.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.330
LG: Pardon?

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.330
CA: You're peeking. You just got to --

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.330
this is a request from the lady in the back.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:20.330
(Laughter)

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.330
Okay.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.330
Try that.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.330
LG: Yeah. Also listen.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.330
OK, now.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.330
This is maybe a little tough.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.330
We will try.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.330
Yes? Good?

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:21.330
(Laughter)

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.330
OK. So,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.330
how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.330
LG: Four. Is five the next card?

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.330
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.330
LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.330
LG: Oh.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.330
So here,

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.330
all the cards are face down --

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.330
you agree? (Audience: Yes.)

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.330
LG: Yes? You see that in the screen?

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.330
And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.330
So next card will be -- was it five?

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.330
Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah --

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.330
I will reverse it face up here.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.330
Yes? Zoe: Yeah.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.330
LG: Six -- six with the thumb.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.330
Seven.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.330
Yeah, I do this. I know where it is,

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.330
because I peeked before and then I do this.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.330
Right?

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.330
Eight.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.330
If --

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.330
and then nine, right?

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.330
Yeah.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.330
Yesterday -- the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas,

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.330
and I used this actually.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.330
Nine? Yeah? Correct?

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.330
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.330
Ten --

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.330
once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.330
Yeah. Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack?

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.330
Jack

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.330
of

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.330
diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.330
LG: Yes?

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.330
And

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.330
queen! Queen, with misdirection.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.330
Misdirection. (Applause)

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.330
Yeah?

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.330
And then,

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.330
king, after exactly

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.330
five seconds.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.330
Yeah. Five. Five seconds.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.330
One,

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.330
two, three, four -- mmm!

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.330
Check it.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.330
Yes?

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.330
CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah!

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.330
Good. Oh.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.330
Touch me, feel --

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.330
ah, ah, you know!

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.330
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you.
