00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Actually, I come from Britain,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
So, that's home really.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
off the southwest coast of India here.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Capital, Malé, where I live.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Actually, sitting here today in Mysore,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And it has been my home these years.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I spend as much of my time as possible

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
investigating the marine life.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I study fish,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
This is a blue whale. We have blue whales

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in the waters around here, off Maldives,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
One of the best places in the world to see blue whales

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is here in this region.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
during the northeast monsoon season,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
you can see blue whales very, very easily.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It's probably the best place in the world to see them.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
comes from the word "season."

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
That's what brings the monsoon rain.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And then in the winter things cool down.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
High pressure builds over India.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And the whole system goes into reverse.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So, the wind is now coming from the northeast

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
out of India, across the Indian Ocean,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
this way towards Africa.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Keep that in mind.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
including dragonflies. And I'm actually

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And one thing you need to know about dragonflies,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
one important thing,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
They need fresh water to breed.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
They lay the eggs into fresh water.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So, they're very important.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They control mosquito larvae, among other things.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And typically, there is a lot of variation,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
lives for 10 or 11 months.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It really does need fresh water.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Now, the particular species of dragonfly

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
I want to talk about is this one,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
But this guy is an exception.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And this is called the Globe Skimmer,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
or Wandering Glider.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But it really hasn't been studied very much.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
living in the Maldives.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
When I first went to the Maldives,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
as I could in and under the water.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Didn't notice them.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
But after some time, after some months, one day

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
as I was going out and about,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I didn't know at the time, but I know now,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And I didn't think anything more of it until

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
the following year, when it happened again,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and then the year after that, and then the year after that.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And I asked people about them and yes,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
they knew, but they didn't know anything,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
where they came from, or anything.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And again I didn't think too much of it.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
But slowly it began to dawn on me that something

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
rather special was happening.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
so here is home.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
So, Maldives, beautiful place.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Laughter)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
It's built entirely of coral reefs.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Average height, about that much above sea level.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
But I'm not going to talk about that.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Another important point of these sand banks

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
is that when it rains,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So, it stays under the soil.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
The trees can put their roots into it.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Humans can dig holes and make a well.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
There is no surface fresh water.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
nothing like that.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
So, why is it that every year

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
millions of dragonflies, millions,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
millions of dragonflies turn up?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
let me have a show of hands, who of you --

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
not yet, not yet!

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Wait for the go. I'll say go.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Those of you who grew up in India,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
maybe tying little bits of string onto them?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.260
You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
It's a widespread phenomenon

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And I got a bit curious about it.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And the first thing I did was started recording

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
when they turned up in the Maldives.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And there is the answer, 21st of October.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Not every year, that's the average date.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
It's going towards India, not from India.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So, are these things, how are these things getting here?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Are they coming from India against the wind?

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Seemed a bit unlikely.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Maldives is a long archipelago.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
When do you see the dragonflies appear?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
information for three years, average,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
24th of September, so late September.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Far north of Maldives, a bit later.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Then Malé, then further south.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And then the southernmost Maldives.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
How on Earth are they doing that?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I didn't know.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
I wanted to know about their seasonality,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
what time of year, this is when they first arrive,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
I had a rigorous scientific transect.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I got on my bicycle,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and I cycled around the island of Malé.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
It's about five kilometers around,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
counting the dragonflies as I go,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And they're here for a very short time,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
October, November, December. That's it.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
That's not the southwest season.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
That's the inter-monsoon,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
the time when the monsoon changes.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.260
and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So, if you've got India here,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And that front in the middle is not vertical,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
it's at an angle.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So, as it comes over towards Malé

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
I can be in the southwest monsoon.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:26.260
but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
two inches long, five centimeters long,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.260
flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and that's okay,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
I know how they come here, but why do they come here?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.260
What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
to their apparent doom?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
What on Earth are they doing?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Well, to cut a long story short,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
they're actually flying right across the ocean.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
They're making it all the way across to East Africa.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I know because we have reports from Seychelles,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
which fit in as well, down here.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And I know because

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
when you look at the rainfall,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
breed in temporary rain water pools.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
the monsoon rains.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
The larvae have to develop very quickly.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
They're up, and they're off.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
the top is rainfall for India.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
By September, October, it's drying out.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And then they run out of land.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
it can fly for thousands of kilometers.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
where it's raining.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.260
two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And the dragonflies you can see today

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
outside here, on the campus,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
are the young of this generation.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
They hatched out in India.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
The wind will swoosh them out across here.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
nothing there, they'll carry on.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Here, here, Kenya, East Africa,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
they've actually just come out of a long drought.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and it's raining there now.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
the wind is always converging to where the rain is.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
The rain occurs, these are summer rains.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
This is a summer monsoon.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
The sun is overhead, maximum heating,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
maximum evaporation, maximum clouds,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
maximum rainfall,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
maximum opportunities for reproduction.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Not only that, because you have this convection,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
you have this rising of the air

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
where it's hot, air is drawn in.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So, the little fellow that hatches out here,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
to where the rain is falling.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
automatically carried to where the rain is falling.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
So, in four generations, one, two, three,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
four and then back.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.260
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Those of you from North America

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
It's only half the length of this one.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And this crossing here, of the ocean,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.260
is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
of any insect.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
A quite incredible feat.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
in Maldives for long enough

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
for it to percolate into my brain

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.260
that something rather special was going on.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
There is more to the story.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
with this fellow. This is a rather special bird.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And it's called the Amur Falcon

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
because it breeds in Amurland.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
It's the border, much of it is the border

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
between China and Russia, up here in the far east.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
So, Siberia, Manchuria.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And that's where it breeds.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
It's, well, you can imagine.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
So, as any sensible bird would do,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
But then the being sensible stopped.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
No, they turn across here.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.260
They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And they are not the only one that makes the crossing.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
It comes with the monsoons.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
This time of year they cross back to Africa.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
so it's known as the Kashmir Roller.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
all the available records of these birds,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
as the dragonflies.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
They make use of exactly the same winds.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
one of these met an unfortunate end.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
He was flying off the coast of Goa,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Same height as the dragonflies go.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
So, they are using the same winds.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And the other thing, the other important factor

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
for all these birds, all medium sized fellows,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
from India to East Africa

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
eats insects, large insects,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.260
(Applause)
