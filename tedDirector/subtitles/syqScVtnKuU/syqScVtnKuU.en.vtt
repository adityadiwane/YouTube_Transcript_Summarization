00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
College presidents are not the first people who come to mind

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
The story begins in the late '90s.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
I was invited to meet with leading educators

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Since education under the Soviet Union

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
was essentially propaganda

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
serving the purposes of a state ideology,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.160
they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
if they were to provide an education

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
worthy of free men and women.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
Given this rare opportunity

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
to start fresh,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
they chose liberal arts

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
as the most compelling model

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
because of its historic commitment

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
to furthering its students' broadest intellectual,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
and deepest ethical potential.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Having made that decision

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
they came to the United States,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
home of liberal arts education,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
to talk with some of us

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
most closely identified

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
with that kind of education.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
They spoke with a passion, an urgency,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
an intellectual conviction

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
a dream long forgotten.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
For, in truth, we had moved light years

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
from the passions that animated them.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
But for me, unlike them,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
in my world, the slate was not clean,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
and what was written on it was not encouraging.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
In truth, liberal arts education

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
no longer exists --

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
We have professionalized liberal arts to the point

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
where they no longer provide the breadth of application

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
that is their signature.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Over the past century

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
the expert has dethroned the educated generalist

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
to become the sole model

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.160
Expertise has for sure had its moments.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
But the price of its dominance is enormous.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Subject matters are broken up

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
You may think you know what is going on

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
in that Jane Austen novel --

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
that is, until your first encounter

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
with postmodern deconstructionism.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
The progression of today's college student

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160
is to jettison every interest except one.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.160
learning more and more about less and less;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
this, despite the evidence all around us

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
of the interconnectedness of things.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Lest you think I exaggerate,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160
here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
As one moves up the ladder,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
values other than technical competence

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
are viewed with increasing suspicion.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
Questions such as,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
"What kind of a world are we making?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
What kind of a world should we be making?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
What kind of a world can we be making?"

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
are treated with more and more skepticism,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
and move off the table.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
in effect yield the connection

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
between education and values

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
to fundamentalists,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
who, you can be sure,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
have no compunctions about using education

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
to further their values:

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
the absolutes of a theocracy.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
Either we have lost touch with those values

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
or, no better,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
believe they need not

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
or cannot be taught.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
This aversion to social values

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
may seem at odds with the explosion

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
of community service programs.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
But despite the attention paid to these efforts,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
they remain emphatically extracurricular.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
In effect, civic-mindedness is treated

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
as outside the realm of what purports to be

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
serious thinking and adult purposes.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
the academy is more likely to engender

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
a learned helplessness

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
than to create a sense of empowerment.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.160
This brew -- oversimplification of civic engagement,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
idealization of the expert,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
fragmentation of knowledge,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
emphasis on technical mastery,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
neutrality as a condition of academic integrity --

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.160
is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
between education and the public good,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
between intellectual integrity

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
and human freedom,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
which were at the heart --

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.160
(Applause) -- of the challenge posed to and by

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
my European colleagues.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
When the astronomical distance

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
between the realities of the academy

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
and the visionary intensity of this challenge

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
were more than enough, I can assure you,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
to give one pause,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
what was happening outside higher education

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
made backing off unthinkable.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Whether it was threats to the environment,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
inequities in the distribution of wealth,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
with respect to the continuing uses of energy,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
we were in desperate straits.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
And that was only the beginning.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
The corrupting of our political life

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
had become a living nightmare;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
nothing was exempt --

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
separation of powers, civil liberties,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
the rule of law,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
the relationship of church and state.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Accompanied by a squandering

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
of the nation's material wealth

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
that defied credulity.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
had become commonplace,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
with an equal distaste

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
for the alternative forms of influence.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
when it came to halting or even stemming

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.160
the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Our public education, once a model for the world,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
has become most noteworthy

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
for its failures.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
eludes vast numbers of our students.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Despite having a research establishment

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
that is the envy of the world,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
more than half of the American public

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
don't believe in evolution.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And don't press your luck

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
about how much those who do believe in it

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
actually understand it.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Incredibly, this nation,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.160
with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
seems utterly helpless

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.160
to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Equally startling, from my point of view,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
is the fact that no one

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
was drawing any connections

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
between what is happening to the body politic,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
We may be at the top of the list

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
We are not even on the list

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
when it comes to our responsibility

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
for the health of this democracy.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
We are playing with fire.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
You can be sure Jefferson knew

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
what he was talking about when he said,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
in a state of civilization,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
it expects what never was,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
and never will be."

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
(Applause)

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
On a more personal note,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
this betrayal of our principles,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
our decency, our hope,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
made it impossible for me

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
to avoid the question,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
"What will I say, years from now,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
when people ask, 'Where were you?'"

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
As president of a leading liberal arts college,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
famous for its innovative history,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
there were no excuses.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
So the conversation began at Bennington.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Knowing that if we were to regain

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
the integrity of liberal education,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
it would take radical rethinking

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
of basic assumptions,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
beginning with our priorities.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
The accomplishment of civic virtue

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.160
is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
at their most challenging.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Our ways of approaching agency and authority

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
turn inside out to reflect the reality

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
that no one has the answers

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
to the challenges facing citizens in this century,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
and everyone has the responsibility

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
for trying and participating in finding them.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
in personal and professional objectives.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
But the balances redressed,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
our shared purposes assume an equal

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
if not greater importance.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves --

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
from health and education

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
to the uses of force --

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
the organizers of the curriculum.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.160
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
mutually dependent circles,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
rather than isolating triangles.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
And the point is not to treat these topics

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160
as topics of study,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
but as frameworks of action.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.160
The challenge: to figure out what it will take

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
to actually do something

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
that makes a significant and sustainable difference.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
Contrary to widely held assumptions,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.160
an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
equity, truth,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
becomes increasingly evident

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
as students discover that interest alone

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
cannot tell them what they need to know

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
when the issue is rethinking education,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
our approach to health,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
or strategies for achieving

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
an economics of equity.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
The value of the past also comes alive;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
it provides a lot of company.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
You are not the first to try to figure this out,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
just as you are unlikely to be the last.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Even more valuable,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
history provides a laboratory

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
in which we see played out

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
the actual, as well as the intended

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
consequences of ideas.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
In the language of my students,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
"Deep thought matters

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
when you're contemplating what to do

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
about things that matter."

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
A new liberal arts that can support this

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
action-oriented curriculum

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
has begun to emerge.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
to maximum effect.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.160
Design, the art of organizing the world of things.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Mediation and improvisation

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.160
also assume a special place in this new pantheon.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160
at the heart of what it takes to manage change

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
where measurement is crucial.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
As is a capacity to discriminate

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
systematically between what is at the core

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and what is at the periphery.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
And when making connections is of the essence,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160
the power of technology emerges with special intensity.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
But so does the importance of content.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
The more powerful our reach,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.160
the more important the question "About what?"

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
artists, at long last,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
take their place at the table,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.160
when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
In this dramatically expanded ideal

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
of a liberal arts education

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
knowledge honed outside the academy

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
becomes essential.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
Social activists, business leaders,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
lawyers, politicians, professionals

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160
will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160
in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.160
Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
to engage the world directly.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
And of course, this new wine

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
needs new bottles

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
of this idea.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
The most important discovery we made

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
in our focus on public action

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
was to appreciate that the hard choices

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
are not between good and evil,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
but between competing goods.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
This discovery is transforming.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
It undercuts self-righteousness,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.160
radically alters the tone and character of controversy,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
and enriches dramatically

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
the possibilities for finding common ground.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
Ideology, zealotry,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.160
unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.160
This is a political education, to be sure.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
But it is a politics of principle,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
not of partisanship.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.160
On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
is the architect's sketch of a building

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
opening in 2010

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
that is to be a center for the advancement

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
of public action.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Think of it as a kind of secular church.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
We intend to turn the intellectual

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and imaginative power, passion and boldness

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
of our students, faculty and staff

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
to developing strategies

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
for acting on the critical challenges of our time.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
So we are doing our job.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
While these past weeks have been a time

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
of national exhilaration in this country,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
it would be tragic if you thought this meant

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160
your job was done.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
The glacial silence we have experienced

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
in the face of the shredding of the constitution,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
the unraveling of our public institutions,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
the deterioration of our infrastructure

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
is not limited to the universities.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
We the people

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
have become inured to our own irrelevance

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
when it comes to doing anything significant

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
about anything that matters

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
concerning governance,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
beyond waiting another four years.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
We persist also

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
in being sidelined by the idea of the expert

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
as the only one capable of coming up with answers,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.160
despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.160
The problem is there is no such thing

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.160
as a viable democracy made up of experts,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.160
zealots, politicians and spectators.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:44.160
(Applause)

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
People will continue and should continue

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
to learn everything there is to know about something or other.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
We actually do it all the time.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
And there will be and should be

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
those who spend a lifetime

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.160
pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
But this single-mindedness will not yield

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
the flexibilities of mind,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
the multiplicity of perspectives,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
the capacities for collaboration and innovation

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
this country needs.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
That is where you come in.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
What is certain is that the individual talent

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
exhibited in such abundance here,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
needs to turn its attention

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
to that collaborative, messy, frustrating,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
contentious and impossible world

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
of politics and public policy.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
President Obama and his team

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
simply cannot do it alone.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.160
If the question of where to start seems overwhelming

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
Being overwhelmed is the first step

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160
if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
on a scale that makes a difference.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
Well, you have two things.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
You have a mind. And you have other people.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Start with those, and change the world.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.160
(Applause)
