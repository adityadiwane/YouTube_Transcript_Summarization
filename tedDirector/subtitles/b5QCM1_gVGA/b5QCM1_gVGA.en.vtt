00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Good morning.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I've come here to share with you an experiment

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.260
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
(Music)

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
what use do we have for a blind woman?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
their independence, and their status in the family.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And the irony is that they don't need to be.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
If we add to that the many of us here now

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
a staggering 200 million people.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
about 30 years back

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
He started this with no money.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
He had to mortgage all his life savings

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
to make a bank loan.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
as a hub-and-spoke model.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And then more recently we started managing hospitals

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in other parts of the country

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
The last three decades,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.260
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
a vast majority of them for the poor people.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
maybe see about 6,000 patients,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.260
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
lots of telemedicine consultations,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.260
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
put in place by Dr. V.,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
a value system, an efficient delivery process,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and fostering the culture of innovation.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.260
(Music)

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
you seem to be one with him.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
An implicit faith in you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and then you respond to it.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
so there is no exploitation.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
It is ourselves we are helping.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It is ourselves we are healing.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.260
(Applause)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.260
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and systems that support it.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.260
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.260
They feel they can train people all over the world,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
to produce a product in the same way

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and deliver it in the same manner

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
in hundreds of places.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and none of it made any sense to us.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
He wanted to create a franchise,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
a mechanism of delivery of eye care

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
with the efficiency of McDonald's.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.260
techniques, methods, all in the same way,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and make it available in every corner of the world.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
The problem of blindness is gone.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
as American or African,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
when we designed the delivery systems.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
we are talking of millions of people,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
very little resource to deal with it,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and then engage with them as a partner,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and here is one such event.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Here a community camp just organized

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
by the community themselves,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
where they find a place, organize volunteers,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and then determine what further testing should be done,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and then those tests are done by technicians

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
who check for glasses,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.260
or check for glaucoma.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and then prescribes a line of treatment,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
usually under a tree.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and that's very important because I think glasses,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
in addition to helping people see,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
So they get it in about 20 minutes

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and those who require surgery, are counseled,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and then there are buses waiting,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
which will transport them to the base hospital.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
many people like this would probably never get services,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
and certainly not when they most need it.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.260
They receive surgery the following day,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and then they will stay for a day or two,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and then they are put back on the buses

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
to be taken back to where they came from,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.260
(Applause)

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And this happens several thousand times each year.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
very efficient process,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and then, to our dismay,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.260
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So we had to do something different,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.260
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
These are truly paperless offices

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260
with completely electronic medical records and so on.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
They receive comprehensive eye exams.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.260
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.260
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
which is over 50,000 people.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And the second year went up to 75 percent.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So I think we have a process by which

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
we can really penetrate into the market

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and reach everyone who needs it,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and in this process of using technology, make sure

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And how much will they pay for this?

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We fixed the pricing, taking into account

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.260
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
(Applause)

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
or more advanced treatment and care?

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
We designed a van with a VSAT,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.260
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
where it is diagnosed,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and then this happens as a way of

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
bridging the technology competence.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
because it focused on the non-customer,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and then by reaching the unreached,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
we're able to significantly grow the market.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
when you have very few ophthalmologists?

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and then you see on the other side,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
another patient is getting ready.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So, as they finish the surgery,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
they just swing the microscope over,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.260
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And then to support the surgeon,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
we require a certain workforce.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.260
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
With the result we have very high productivity,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
very high quality at very, very low cost.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
So, putting all this together, what really happened was

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
the productivity of our staff was

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
significantly higher than anyone else.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.260
(Applause)

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
This is a very busy table,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
but what this really is conveying is that,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
when it comes to quality, we have put in

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
very good quality-assurance systems.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
As a result, our complications are significantly lower

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
(Applause)

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
So the final part of the puzzle is,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
how do you make all this work financially,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
especially when the people can't pay for it?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
nothing more, and often much less.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
I think that has been a big savior, even now.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
what you have as a surplus.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
The result has been, over the years,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
the expenditure has increased with volumes.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
The revenues increase at a higher level,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
giving us a healthy margin

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
while you're treating a large number of people for free.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
I think in absolute terms,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.260
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Applause)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But this really requires going beyond what we do,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
or what we have done,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.260
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
We created competition for ourselves,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and then we made eye care affordable

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
by making low-cost consumables.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
We proactively and systematically

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in the second year after our consultation,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
are double their output

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and then achieve financial recovery as well.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
The other part was how do you address

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260
this increase in cost of technology?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
There was a time when we failed to negotiate

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.260
so we set up a manufacturing unit.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.260
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.260
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.260
or is it just India or developing countries?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:42.260
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
of the volume of what the UK does,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
And we do about 300,000.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
against the 70 trained by them,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So we're really comparing apples to apples.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
We looked at cost.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
(Laughter)

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:17.260
(Applause)

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So, I think it is simple to say

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.260
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
I think there is more to it.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Maybe there is --

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
or regulations, their defensive practice.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
So, I think decoding this can probably bring

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.260
answers to most developed countries

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
including the U.S., and maybe

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Obama's ratings can go up again.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
(Laughter)

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
in conditions where the problem is very large,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
which cuts across all economic strata,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
where we have a good solution,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
I think the process I described,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
can give an answer,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and there are many which fit this paradigm.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
There are many where this paradigm can now play,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
but I think probably one of the most challenging things

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
is on the softer side.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
Now, how do you create compassion?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Now, how do you make people own the problem,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
want to do something about it?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
There are a bit harder issues.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.260
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
we identify with all that is in the world

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
so there is no exploitation.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
It is ourselves we are helping.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
It is ourselves we are healing.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
TR: Thank you very much.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:20.260
(Applause)
