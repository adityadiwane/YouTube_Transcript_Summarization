00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.754
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.269
there's one question that never leaves me:

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:26.985
How do we deal with extreme violence

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.486
without using force in return?

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.037
When you're faced with brutality,

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:35.953
whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.653
or domestic violence --

00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:40.569
or, on the streets of Syria today,

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.120
facing tanks and shrapnel,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.467
what's the most effective thing to do?

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.065
Fight back? Give in?

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:52.406
Use more force?

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:56.398
This question: "How do I deal with a bully

00:00:56.398 --> 00:01:00.148
without becoming a thug in return?"

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:03.164
has been with me ever since I was a child.

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:05.715
I remember I was about 13,

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:10.701
glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:14.966
as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.765
and kids not much older than me

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.266
were throwing themselves at the tanks

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.434
and getting mown down.

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:26.235
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:28.949
And my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:31.231
And I said, "I'm going to Budapest."

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.865
And she said, "What on Earth for?"

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.914
And I said, "Kids are getting killed there.

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:37.766
There's something terrible happening."

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.783
And she said, "Don't be so silly."

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:42.383
And I started to cry.

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:44.598
And she got it, she said,

00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:46.365
"Okay, I see it's serious.

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:49.199
You're much too young to help.

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.834
You need training. I'll help you.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:53.999
But just unpack your suitcase."

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.565
And so I got some training

00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:01.498
and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.

00:02:01.498 --> 00:02:05.199
But I realized that what I really needed to know

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:07.598
I couldn't get from training courses.

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:09.784
I wanted to understand

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:14.234
how violence, how oppression, works.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:19.182
And what I've discovered since is this:

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:23.248
Bullies use violence in three ways.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:28.551
They use political violence to intimidate,

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.965
physical violence to terrorize

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:41.489
and mental or emotional violence to undermine.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.716
And only very rarely in very few cases

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:48.232
does it work to use more violence.

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:54.441
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.465
and 27 years later

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:58.448
he and his colleagues

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:00.433
had slowly and carefully

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:05.399
honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.599
to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.465
into a democracy.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:16.197
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:23.364
They realized that using force against force

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:28.560
doesn't work.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.753
So what does work?

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:34.222
Over time I've collected about a half-dozen methods

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:36.055
that do work -- of course there are many more --

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:38.401
that do work and that are effective.

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:39.768
And the first is

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:42.286
that the change that has to take place

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:46.751
has to take place here, inside me.

00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.851
It's my response, my attitude, to oppression

00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:53.702
that I've got control over,

00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:56.002
and that I can do something about.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:00.185
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:02.684
That means I need to know how I tick,

00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:04.935
when I collapse,

00:04:04.935 --> 00:04:09.269
where my formidable points are,

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.767
where my weaker points are.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.235
When do I give in?

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:18.498
What will I stand up for?

00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:23.637
And meditation or self-inspection

00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:26.171
is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one --

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.289
it's one of the ways

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.406
of gaining this kind of inner power.

00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:33.888
And my heroine here -- like Satish's --

00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:36.921
is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:40.554
She was leading a group of students

00:04:40.554 --> 00:04:42.954
on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:47.137
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.

00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:48.304
And she realized straight away

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.222
that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers

00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:57.920
were more scared than the student protesters behind her.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.625
But she told the students to sit down.

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:07.921
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:11.371
and such total lack of fear

00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:15.471
that she could walk right up to the first gun,

00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:19.547
put her hand on it and lower it.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:27.342
And no one got killed.

00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:31.299
So that's what the mastery of fear can do --

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:33.600
not only faced with machine guns,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.766
but if you meet a knife fight in the street.

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:40.131
But we have to practice.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.032
So what about our fear?

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:46.986
I have a little mantra.

00:05:46.986 --> 00:05:50.427
My fear grows fat

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:52.644
on the energy I feed it.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.931
And if it grows very big

00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:57.293
it probably happens.

00:05:57.293 --> 00:06:01.728
So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:04.444
when something you've been worrying about wakes you up --

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:06.834
I see a lot of people --

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.444
and for an hour you toss and turn,

00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:12.122
it gets worse and worse,

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.244
and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow

00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:17.447
by a monster this big.

00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:19.381
The only thing to do

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:21.215
is to get up, make a cup of tea

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:26.531
and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:29.012
You're the adult.

00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:30.899
The fear is the child.

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:32.344
And you talk to the fear

00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:35.530
and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.147
How can this be made better?

00:06:40.147 --> 00:06:41.897
How can the child feel stronger?

00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:43.346
And you make a plan.

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:45.351
And you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.118
Half-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:54.850
I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday --

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:58.851
paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.849
(Laughter)

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:02.356
So I did the thing.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:06.485
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:10.641
and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:15.040
(Applause)

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.556
So that's fear. What about anger?

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:21.958
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.806
But anger is like gasoline,

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:28.260
and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
you've got an inferno.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.377
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:39.543
If we can put our anger inside an engine,

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:41.326
it can drive us forward,

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:44.314
it can get us through the dreadful moments

00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:48.277
and it can give us real inner power.

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:51.395
And I learned this in my work

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:53.659
with nuclear weapon policy-makers.

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:56.378
Because at the beginning I was so outraged

00:07:56.378 --> 00:07:59.694
at the dangers they were exposing us to

00:07:59.694 --> 00:08:04.828
that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.

00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:07.361
Totally ineffective.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:11.110
In order to develop a dialogue for change

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.183
we have to deal with our anger.

00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:17.860
It's okay to be angry with the thing --

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.960
the nuclear weapons in this case --

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.811
but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.

00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.426
They are human beings just like us.

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:29.077
And they're doing what they think is best.

00:08:29.077 --> 00:08:33.060
And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.977
So that's the third one, anger.

00:08:35.977 --> 00:08:37.377
And it brings me to the crux

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:40.611
of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,

00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:41.676
in the world today,

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:45.694
which is that last century was top-down power.

00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:49.959
It was still governments telling people what to do.

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.994
This century there's a shift.

00:08:51.994 --> 00:08:55.877
It's bottom-up or grassroots power.

00:08:55.877 --> 00:08:59.093
It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.

00:08:59.093 --> 00:09:05.774
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away

00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:08.047
to bring about change.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:12.313
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on

00:09:12.313 --> 00:09:15.864
that local people in areas of very hot conflict

00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:18.300
know what to do.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.516
They know best what to do.

00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:23.798
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:25.997
And the kind of thing they're doing

00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:29.165
is demobilizing militias,

00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:31.768
rebuilding economies,

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:34.118
resettling refugees,

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:39.619
even liberating child soldiers.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.485
And they have to risk their lives almost every day

00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:45.704
to do this.

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:49.518
And what they've realized

00:09:49.518 --> 00:09:54.451
is that using violence in the situations they operate in

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:58.970
is not only less humane,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.105
but it's less effective

00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:07.636
than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.

00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:11.568
And I think that the U.S. military

00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:18.448
is finally beginning to get this.

00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:21.157
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy

00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:25.990
has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.193
and if civilians get in the way,

00:10:29.193 --> 00:10:33.459
that's written as "collateral damage."

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:40.192
And this is so infuriating and humiliating

00:10:40.192 --> 00:10:42.542
for the population of Afghanistan,

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:46.890
that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.060
when people are so disgusted by, for example,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.439
the burning of the Koran.

00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:55.440
So the training of the troops has to change.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.548
And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:03.332
The British military have always been much better at this.

00:11:03.332 --> 00:11:09.014
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,

00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:12.182
and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel

00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.847
called Chris Hughes.

00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:18.064
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf --

00:11:18.064 --> 00:11:20.232
in Iraq actually --

00:11:20.232 --> 00:11:25.265
and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,

00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:29.863
screaming, yelling, furiously angry,

00:11:29.863 --> 00:11:34.331
and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,

00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:36.831
didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.

00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:41.081
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng

00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:44.950
with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.648
and he said, "Kneel."

00:11:46.648 --> 00:11:49.448
And these huge soldiers

00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:52.081
with their backpacks and their body armor,

00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:56.555
wobbled to the ground.

00:11:56.555 --> 00:12:02.640
And complete silence fell.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.198
And after about two minutes,

00:12:05.198 --> 00:12:09.474
everybody moved aside and went home.

00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:14.956
Now that to me is wisdom in action.

00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:19.122
In the moment, that's what he did.

00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:24.884
And it's happening everywhere now.

00:12:24.884 --> 00:12:26.793
You don't believe me?

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:30.452
Have you asked yourselves

00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:34.892
why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed

00:12:34.892 --> 00:12:38.243
over the last 30 years?

00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:43.310
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.525
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,

00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:50.411
Mali, Madagascar,

00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.193
Poland, the Philippines,

00:12:54.193 --> 00:12:59.276
Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on,

00:12:59.276 --> 00:13:03.866
and now Tunisia and Egypt.

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:07.916
And this hasn't just happened.

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:11.067
A lot of it is due to a book

00:13:11.067 --> 00:13:15.532
written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.

00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:19.549
He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy"

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:24.945
with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.

00:13:24.945 --> 00:13:27.032
And it's been translated into 26 languages.

00:13:27.032 --> 00:13:29.116
It's flown around the world.

00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:36.303
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,

00:13:36.303 --> 00:13:41.725
because it works and it's effective.

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:46.283
So this is what gives me hope --

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:50.036
not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.

00:13:50.036 --> 00:13:54.052
Because finally human beings are getting it.

00:13:54.052 --> 00:14:01.670
We're getting practical, doable methodologies

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.254
to answer my question:

00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:09.556
How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:13.966
We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:

00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:17.684
inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge,

00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:21.250
recognizing and working with our fear,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.768
using anger as a fuel,

00:14:24.768 --> 00:14:27.333
cooperating with others,

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.268
banding together with others,

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:31.450
courage,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:38.419
and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:42.533
Now I don't just believe in non-violence.

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:45.468
I don't have to believe in it.

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.018
I see evidence everywhere of how it works.

00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:55.068
And I see that we, ordinary people,

00:14:55.068 --> 00:15:01.386
can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:04.109
We can bring to an end

00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:09.108
the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:17.049
And we can organize to overcome oppression

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:19.667
by opening our hearts

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:25.517
as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.

00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:30.117
And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced

00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:34.551
in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.672
Thank you.

00:15:36.672 --> 00:15:41.241
(Applause)
