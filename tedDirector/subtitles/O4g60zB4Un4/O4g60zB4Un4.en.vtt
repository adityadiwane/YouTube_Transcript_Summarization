00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I call myself a body architect.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I trained in classical ballet

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and have a background in architecture and fashion.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
As a body architect, I fascinate with the human body

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and explore how I can transform it.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I worked at Philips Electronics

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in the far-future design research lab,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
looking 20 years into the future.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
which is augmented by touch,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
or dresses that blushed and shivered with light.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I started my own experiments.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
These were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
(Laughter)

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
he doesn't normally look like this --

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and we used ourselves as models.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
We transformed our apartments into our laboratories,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
We were creating

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
visual imagery provoking human evolution.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Whilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
something that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
A maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I set up my studio in the red-light district

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and found a way to redefine the skin

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and create this dynamic textile.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and she was also exploring

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
how technology coexists with raw human emotion.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And she talked about how technology with these new feathers,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
this new face paint, this punk, the way that we identify with the world,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and we made this music video.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm fascinated with the idea

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
of what happens when you merge biology with technology,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
biology, in the future, away from disease and aging.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And I thought about this concept of,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
imagine if we could reprogram

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.260
our own body odor, modify and biologically enhance it,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Or the way that we attract sexual partners?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And would we revert back to being more like animals,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
more primal modes of communication?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I worked with a synthetic biologist,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and I created a swallowable perfume,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
which is a cosmetic pill that you eat

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It completely blows apart the way that perfume is,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and provides a whole new format.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It's perfume coming from the inside out.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It redefines the role of skin, and our bodies become an atomizer.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I've learned that there's no boundaries,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and if I look at the evolution of my work

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
i can see threads and connections that make sense.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But when I look towards the future,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
the next project is completely unknown and wide open.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and it's these conversations and these experiences

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that connect these ideas, and they kind of instinctively come out.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
As a body architect,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I've created this limitless and boundless platform

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
for me to discover whatever I want.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And I feel like I've just got started.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So here's to another day at the office.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Thank you!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Thank you!
