00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:15.191
So I come from the tallest
people on the planet --

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.365
the Dutch.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.069
It hasn't always been this way.

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:22.307
In fact, all across the globe,
people have been gaining height.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:23.894
In the last 150 years,

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:25.079
in developed countries,

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:27.611
on average, we have gotten
10 centimeters taller.

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.918
And scientists have a lot
of theories about why this is,

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:33.362
but almost all of them involve nutrition,

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.670
namely the increase of dairy and meat.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.940
In the last 50 years,

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:40.838
global meat consumption
has more than quadrupled,

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:44.189
from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:48.436
Something similar has been going on
with milk and eggs.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.029
In every society where incomes have risen,
so has protein consumption.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.982
And we know that globally,
we are getting richer.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.211
And as the middle class is on the rise,
so is our global population,

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:04.186
from 7 billion of us today
to 9.7 billion by 2050,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.673
which means that by 2050,

00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:08.224
we are going to need at least
70 percent more protein

00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:10.681
than what is available to humankind today.

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:14.341
And the latest prediction of the UN
puts that population number,

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:16.825
by the end of this century, at 11 billion,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.809
which means that we are going
to need a lot more protein.

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:22.566
This challenge is staggering --

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.397
so much so, that recently,

00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.539
a team at Anglia Ruskin
Global Sustainability Institute suggested

00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:29.699
that if we don't change
our global policies

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.271
and food production systems,

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.557
our societies might actually collapse
in the next 30 years.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:40.463
Currently, our ocean serves
as the main source of animal protein.

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:44.169
Over 2.6 billion people
depend on it every single day.

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:46.360
At the same time,

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:49.035
our global fisheries
are two-and-a-half times larger

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:51.583
than what our oceans
can sustainably support,

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.329
meaning that humans take
far more fish from the ocean

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:56.657
than the oceans can naturally replace.

00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:01.473
WWF recently published a report
showing that just in the last 40 years,

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.087
our global marine life
has been slashed in half.

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:09.298
And another recent report suggests
that of our largest predatory species,

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:11.670
such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.944
over 90 percent has disappeared
since the 1950s.

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:19.426
And there are a lot of great, sustainable
fishing initiatives across the planet

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.056
working towards better practices
and better-managed fisheries.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.231
But ultimately,

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.857
all of these initiatives are working
towards keeping current catch constant.

00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:29.715
It's unlikely,

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.529
even with the best-managed fisheries,

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.516
that we are going to be able to take
much more from the ocean

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.695
than we do today.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.464
We have to stop plundering
our oceans the way we have.

00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:40.646
We need to alleviate the pressure on it.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.988
And we are at a point

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:44.777
where if we push much harder
for more produce,

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.500
we might face total collapse.

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:51.869
Our current systems are not going to feed
a growing global population.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.129
So how do we fix this?

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.891
What's the world going to look like
in just 35 short years

00:02:56.915 --> 00:03:00.514
when there's 2.7 billion more of us
sharing the same resources?

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.931
We could all become vegan.

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:04.708
Sounds like a great idea,

00:03:04.732 --> 00:03:06.036
but it's not realistic

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.405
and it's impossibly hard
to mandate globally.

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:12.013
People are eating animal protein
whether we like it or not.

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:14.396
And suppose we fail to change our ways

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.546
and continue on the current path,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.404
failing to meet demands.

00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:20.650
The World Health Organization
recently reported

00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:24.836
that 800 million people are suffering
from malnutrition and food shortage,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.271
which is due to that same
growing, global population

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:32.317
and the declining access to resources
like water, energy and land.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.272
It takes very little imagination

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:40.246
to picture a world of global unrest,
riots and further malnutrition.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.896
People are hungry,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.958
and we are running dangerously low
on natural resources.

00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:46.884
For so, so many reasons,

00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:49.662
we need to change our global
food production systems.

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:51.679
We must do better

00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:52.868
and there is a solution.

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:55.477
And that solution lies in aquaculture --

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.447
the farming of fish, plants like seaweed,
shellfish and crustaceans.

00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.290
As the great ocean hero
Jacques Cousteau once said,

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:05.188
"We must start using the ocean
as farmers instead of hunters.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:08.742
That's what civilization is all about --
farming instead of hunting."

00:04:09.402 --> 00:04:11.830
Fish is the last food that we hunt.

00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:15.682
And why is it that we keep
hearing phrases like,

00:04:15.706 --> 00:04:17.389
"Life's too short for farmed fish,"

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:19.001
or, "Wild-caught, of course!"

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.374
over fish that we know
virtually nothing about?

00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:23.609
We don't know what it ate
during its lifetime,

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.825
and we don't know what
pollution it encounters.

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:27.739
And if it was a large predatory species,

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:30.602
it might have gone through the coast
of Fukushima yesterday.

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:31.970
We don't know.

00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:33.337
Very few people realize

00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:37.003
the traceability in fisheries
never goes beyond the hunter

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.542
that caught the wild animal.

00:04:38.566 --> 00:04:40.003
But let's back up for a second

00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:42.614
and talk about why fish
is the best food choice.

00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:43.789
It's healthy,

00:04:43.813 --> 00:04:45.069
it prevents heart disease,

00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:46.536
it provides key amino acids

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.313
and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:52.214
which is very different from almost
any other type of meat.

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:53.848
And aside from being healthy,

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:56.469
it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.

00:04:56.493 --> 00:04:59.676
Think about it -- most animal farming
is pretty monotonous.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.351
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.452
and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --
pretty much sums it up.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:11.291
And then there's 500 species of fish
being farmed currently.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:14.243
not that Western supermarkets
reflect that on their shelves,

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:15.664
but that's beside that point.

00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:18.439
And you can farm fish
in a very healthy manner

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.479
that's good for us, good for the planet
and good for the fish.

00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:23.998
I know I sound fish-obsessed --

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:26.148
(Laughter)

00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:27.323
Let me explain:

00:05:27.347 --> 00:05:30.506
My brilliant partner and wife,
Amy Novograntz, and I got involved

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.481
in aquaculture a couple of years ago.

00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:34.777
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.097
who won the TED Prize in 2009.

00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.255
We actually met on Mission Blue I
in the Galapagos.

00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:43.094
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;

00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:46.308
me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands
and concerned citizen,

00:05:46.332 --> 00:05:48.705
love to dive, passion for the oceans.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.626
Mission Blue truly changed our lives.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.801
We fell in love,

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:54.301
got married

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:56.566
and we came away really inspired,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.799
thinking we really want to do something
about ocean conservation --

00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:01.558
something that was meant to last,

00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:04.138
that could make a real difference

00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:06.788
and something that we could do together.

00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:11.031
Little did we expect that that would
lead us to fish farming.

00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:13.839
But a few months after
we got off the boat,

00:06:13.863 --> 00:06:16.397
we got to a meeting
at Conservation International,

00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:20.448
where the Director General of WorldFish
was talking about aquaculture,

00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:24.218
asking a room full of environmentalists
to stop turning from it,

00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:26.003
realize what was going on

00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:27.448
and to really get involved

00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:29.584
because aquaculture has the potential

00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:32.694
to be just what our oceans
and populations need.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.067
We were stunned when we heard the stats

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.627
that we didn't know more
about this industry already

00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:40.558
and excited about the chance
to help get it right.

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:42.789
And to talk about stats --

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:45.589
right now, the amount of fish
consumed globally,

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.669
wild catch and farmed combined,

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:50.025
is twice the tonnage
of the total amount of beef

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:51.922
produced on planet earth last year.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.746
Every single fishing vessel combined,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.701
small and large, across the globe,

00:06:56.725 --> 00:07:00.602
together produce about 65 million tons
of wild-caught seafood

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.023
for human consumption.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:03.929
Aquaculture this year,

00:07:03.953 --> 00:07:05.532
for the first time in history,

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:08.413
actually produces more
than what we catch from the wild.

00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:10.025
But now this:

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:11.403
Demand is going to go up.

00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:13.666
In the next 35 years,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.685
we are going to need an additional
85 million tons to meet demand,

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:21.304
which is one-and-a-half times
as much, almost,

00:07:21.328 --> 00:07:23.887
as what we catch globally
out of our oceans.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.466
An enormous number.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:29.911
It's safe to assume that that's not
going to come from the ocean.

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:31.604
It needs to come from farming.

00:07:32.163 --> 00:07:33.478
And talk about farming --

00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:35.469
for farming you need resources.

00:07:36.313 --> 00:07:39.242
As a human needs to eat
to grow and stay alive,

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:40.739
so does an animal.

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:43.658
A cow needs to eat
eight to nine pounds of feed

00:07:43.682 --> 00:07:46.133
and drink almost 8,000 liters of water

00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.037
to create just one pound of meat.

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:50.578
Experts agree that it's impossible

00:07:50.602 --> 00:07:53.754
to farm cows for every
inhabitant on this planet.

00:07:53.778 --> 00:07:56.516
We just don't have enough feed or water.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.294
And we can't keep cutting down
rain forests for it.

00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:02.827
And fresh water -- planet earth
has a very limited supply.

00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:04.962
We need something more efficient

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:07.867
to keep humankind alive on this planet.

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:10.664
And now let's compare
that with fish farming.

00:08:11.164 --> 00:08:15.102
You can farm one pound of fish
with just one pound of feed,

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:17.458
and depending on species, even less.

00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:19.075
And why is that?

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.868
Well, that's because fish,
first of all, float.

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:26.478
They don't need to stand around all day
resisting gravity like we do.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.560
And most fish are cold-blooded --

00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:30.264
they don't need to heat themselves.

00:08:30.288 --> 00:08:31.456
Fish chills.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.101
(Laughter)

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.665
And it needs very little water,

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:35.967
which is counterintuitive,

00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.378
but as we say,

00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:39.796
it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.233
Fish are the most resource-efficient
animal protein available to humankind,

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.692
aside from insects.

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:48.911
How much we've learned since.

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:52.919
For example, on top of that
65 million tons that's annually caught

00:08:52.943 --> 00:08:54.553
for human consumption,

00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:58.564
there's an additional 30 million tons
caught for animal feed,

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:02.129
mostly sardines and anchovies
for the aquaculture industry

00:09:02.153 --> 00:09:04.190
that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.

00:09:04.602 --> 00:09:05.949
This is madness.

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:10.120
Sixty-five percent of these fisheries,
globally, are badly managed.

00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:12.854
Some of the worst issues
of our time are connected to it.

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:14.176
It's destroying our oceans.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.218
The worst slavery issues
imaginable are connected to it.

00:09:17.702 --> 00:09:20.512
Recently, an article came out of Stanford

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:23.409
saying that if 50 percent
of the world's aquaculture industry

00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:24.735
would stop using fish meal,

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.409
our oceans would be saved.

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:28.492
Now think about that for a minute.

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:31.536
Now, we know that the oceans
have far more problems --

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.345
they have pollution,
there's acidification,

00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:35.952
coral reef destruction and so on.

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.513
But it underlines the impact
of our fisheries,

00:09:38.537 --> 00:09:41.112
and it underlines how
interconnected everything is.

00:09:41.608 --> 00:09:45.224
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,

00:09:45.248 --> 00:09:48.282
climate change, food security and so on.

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:50.336
In the search for alternatives,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.415
the industry, on a massive scale,

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:54.602
has reverted to plant-based alternatives

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:57.479
like soy, industrial chicken waste,

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:59.345
blood meal from slaughterhouses

00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:00.624
and so on.

00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:03.112
And we understand where
these choices come from,

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:05.265
but this is not the right approach.

00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:06.544
It's not sustainable,

00:10:06.568 --> 00:10:07.742
it's not healthy.

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:10.429
Have you ever seen a chicken
at the bottom of the ocean?

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:11.804
Of course not.

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.024
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,

00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:15.810
it literally explodes.

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:17.615
Salmon is a carnivore,

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.534
it has no way to digest soy.

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:23.171
Now, fish farming is by far

00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:25.512
the best animal farming
available to humankind.

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:27.908
But it's had a really bad reputation.

00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:30.552
There's been excessive use of chemicals,

00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:33.756
there's been virus and disease
transfered to wild populations,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.109
ecosystem destruction and pollution,

00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:38.347
escaped fish breeding
with wild populations,

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.371
altering the overall genetic pool,

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.861
and then of course, as just mentioned,

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.964
the unsustainable feed ingredients.

00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:46.639
How blessed were the days

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:49.110
when we could just enjoy
food that was on our plate,

00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:50.339
whatever it was.

00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:52.364
Once you know, you know.

00:10:52.388 --> 00:10:53.594
You can't go back.

00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:54.769
It's not fun.

00:10:54.793 --> 00:10:57.982
We really need a transparent food
system that we can trust,

00:10:58.006 --> 00:10:59.680
that produces healthy food.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:01.925
But the good news is

00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:04.862
that decades of development and research

00:11:04.886 --> 00:11:07.348
have led to a lot of new
technologies and knowledge

00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:09.184
that allow us to do a lot better.

00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:11.854
We can now farm fish
without any of these issues.

00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:15.429
I think of agriculture
before the green revolution --

00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:18.476
we are at aquaculture
and the blue revolution.

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.054
New technologies means

00:11:21.078 --> 00:11:24.646
that we can now produce a feed
that's perfectly natural,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.854
with a minimal footprint

00:11:25.878 --> 00:11:29.823
that consists of microbes, insects,
seaweeds and micro-algae.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:31.992
Healthy for the people,

00:11:32.016 --> 00:11:33.167
healthy for the fish,

00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:34.512
healthy for the planet.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:36.443
Microbes, for example,

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:39.316
can be a perfect alternative
for high-grade fish meal --

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.495
at scale.

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.884
Insects are the --

00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:44.869
well, first of all, the perfect recycling

00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:46.623
because they're grown on food waste;

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:47.799
but second,

00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:48.974
think of fly-fishing,

00:11:48.998 --> 00:11:52.311
and you know how logical
it actually is to use it as fish feed.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.735
You don't need large tracts of land for it

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.169
and you don't need
to cut down rain forests for it.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.959
And microbes and insects are actually
net water producers.

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:03.738
This revolution is starting as we speak,

00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:05.239
it just needs scale.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:09.559
We can now farm far more
species than ever before

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:13.220
in controlled, natural conditions,
creating happy fish.

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:15.181
I imagine, for example,

00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:20.813
a closed system that's performing
more efficiently than insect farming,

00:12:20.837 --> 00:12:24.081
where you can produce
healthy, happy, delicious fish

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.477
with little or no effluent,

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:27.961
almost no energy and almost no water

00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:30.294
and a natural feed
with a minimal footprint.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:34.311
Or a system where you grow
up to 10 species next to each other --

00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:35.711
off of each other,

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.175
mimicking nature.

00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:39.288
You need very little feed,

00:12:39.312 --> 00:12:40.534
very little footprint.

00:12:40.558 --> 00:12:44.459
I think of seaweed growing
off the effluent of fish, for example.

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:49.248
There's great technologies
popping up all over the globe.

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:51.753
From alternatives to battle disease

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:54.642
so we don't need antibiotics
and chemicals anymore,

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:58.322
to automated feeders that feel
when the fish are hungry,

00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:01.637
so we can save on feed
and create less pollution.

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:04.619
Software systems that gather
data across farms,

00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:06.529
so we can improve farm practices.

00:13:07.127 --> 00:13:09.983
There's really cool stuff
happening all over the globe.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.313
And make no mistake --
all of these things are possible

00:13:13.337 --> 00:13:16.472
at a cost that's competitive
to what a farmer spends today.

00:13:17.024 --> 00:13:20.971
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse
for anyone to not do the right thing.

00:13:22.164 --> 00:13:24.423
So somebody needs to connect the dots

00:13:24.447 --> 00:13:27.030
and give these developments
a big kick in the butt.

00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:30.071
And that's what we've been working on
the last couple of years,

00:13:30.095 --> 00:13:32.581
and that's what we need
to be working on together --

00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:35.400
rethinking everything from the ground up,

00:13:35.424 --> 00:13:37.943
with a holistic view
across the value chain,

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:40.101
connecting all these things
across the globe,

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:42.173
alongside great entrepreneurs

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.770
that are willing to share
a collective vision.

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:48.307
Now is the time to create
change in this industry

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:50.542
and to push it into
a sustainable direction.

00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:51.988
This industry is still young,

00:13:52.012 --> 00:13:53.704
much of its growth is still ahead.

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.875
It's a big task, but not
as far-fetched as you might think.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:58.049
It's possible.

00:13:59.032 --> 00:14:01.209
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:02.780
We want to eat good and healthy.

00:14:02.804 --> 00:14:04.876
And if we eat an animal,
it needs to be one

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.558
that had a happy and healthy life.

00:14:06.582 --> 00:14:08.789
We need to have a meal that we can trust,

00:14:08.813 --> 00:14:10.026
live long lives.

00:14:10.577 --> 00:14:14.476
And this is not just for people
in San Francisco or Northern Europe --

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.346
this is for all of us.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.030
Even in the poorest countries,

00:14:18.054 --> 00:14:19.564
it's not just about money.

00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:23.404
People prefer something fresh
and healthy that they can trust

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:27.220
over something that comes from far away
that they know nothing about.

00:14:27.244 --> 00:14:28.560
We're all the same.

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:31.418
The day will come

00:14:31.442 --> 00:14:34.683
where people will realize -- no, demand --
farmed fish on their plate

00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:37.084
that's farmed well
and that's farmed healthy --

00:14:38.204 --> 00:14:39.458
and refuse anything less.

00:14:39.482 --> 00:14:40.851
You can help speed this up.

00:14:41.163 --> 00:14:43.521
Ask questions when you order seafood.

00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:45.402
Where does my fish come from?

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.941
Who raised it,

00:14:46.965 --> 00:14:48.330
and what did it eat?

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:52.667
Information about where your fish
comes from and how it was produced

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.833
needs to be much more readily available.

00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:58.847
And consumers need to put pressure
on the aquaculture industry

00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:00.163
to do the right thing.

00:15:00.653 --> 00:15:02.696
So every time you order,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.687
ask for detail

00:15:04.711 --> 00:15:07.193
and show that you really care
about what you eat

00:15:07.217 --> 00:15:08.647
and what's been given to you.

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:11.343
And eventually, they will listen.

00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:13.164
And all of us will benefit.

00:15:13.575 --> 00:15:14.726
Thank you.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.333
(Applause)
