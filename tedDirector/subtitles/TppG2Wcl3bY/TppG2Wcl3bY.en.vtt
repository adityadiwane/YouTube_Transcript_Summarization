00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.867
I'm a journalist,

00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:16.830
and I'm an immigrant.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:20.084
And these two conditions define me.

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.526
I was born in Mexico,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.276
but I've spent more than half my life
reporting in the United States,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.284
a country which was itself
created by immigrants.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:31.218
As a reporter

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:32.944
and as a foreigner,

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:35.307
I've learned that neutrality,

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.336
silence

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.726
and fear aren't the best options --

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.954
not in journalism, nor in life.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.157
Neutrality

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:48.252
is often an excuse that we journalists use

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:51.585
to hide from our true responsibility.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.423
What is that responsibility?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.359
It is to question

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:57.565
and to challenge

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.946
those in positions of power.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.429
That's what journalism is for.

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:02.228
That's the beauty of journalism:

00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:04.745
to question and challenge the powerful.

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:08.838
Of course, we have the obligation
to report reality as it is,

00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:10.600
not how we would like it to be.

00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:14.080
In that sense, I agree
with the principle of objectivity:

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:16.562
if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:19.814
If there are a million unemployed people,
I say there are a million.

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:21.118
But neutrality

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:24.404
won't necessarily lead me to the truth.

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.560
Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:32.253
and I present both sides of a news item --

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.039
the Democratic and the Republican,

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:36.700
the liberal and the conservative,

00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:38.673
the government's and the opposition's --

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:41.156
in the end, I have no guarantee,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.371
nor are any of us guaranteed
that we'll know what's true

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:45.803
and what's not true.

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:47.728
Life is much more complicated,

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:52.767
and I believe journalism should reflect
that very complexity.

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:56.016
To be clear: I refuse

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:58.496
to be a tape recorder.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.929
I didn't become a journalist
to be a tape recorder.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.261
I know what you're going to say:
no one uses tape recorders nowadays.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:05.352
(Laughter)

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.166
In that case, I refuse
to take out my cell phone

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.619
and hit the record button

00:02:11.643 --> 00:02:14.273
and point it in front of me
as if I were at a concert,

00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:15.772
like a fan at a concert.

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:18.916
That is not true journalism.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.320
Contrary to what many people think,

00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:25.893
journalists are making
value judgments all the time,

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.766
ethical and moral judgments.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.944
And we're always making decisions
that are exceedingly personal

00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:35.807
and extraordinarily subjective.

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.035
For example:

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.376
What happens if you're called
to cover a dictatorship,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.465
like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.309
or Fidel Castro's in Cuba?

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:49.082
Are you going to report only what
the general and commander want,

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:50.526
or will you confront them?

00:02:50.997 --> 00:02:54.128
What happens if you find out
that in your country

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.737
or in the country next door,

00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.773
students are disappearing

00:02:59.797 --> 00:03:01.798
and hidden graves are appearing,

00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:04.790
or that millions of dollars
are disappearing from the budget

00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:09.224
and that ex-presidents are magically
now multimillionaires?

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:11.297
Will you report only the official version?

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.547
Or what happens

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:14.770
if you're assigned to cover

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:20.789
the presidential elections
of the primary superpower,

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:25.196
and one of the candidates makes
comments that are racist,

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:27.572
sexist

00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:29.315
and xenophobic?

00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:32.241
That happened to me.

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:34.974
And I want to tell you what I did,

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.566
but first, let me explain
where I'm coming from,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.736
so you can understand my reaction.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.394
I grew up in Mexico City,
the oldest of five brothers,

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:50.090
and our family simply couldn't afford
to pay for all of our college tuition.

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:53.528
So I studied in the morning,
and worked in the afternoon.

00:03:53.552 --> 00:03:55.045
Eventually,

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:58.951
I got the job I had always wanted:

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:00.300
television reporter.

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.024
It was a big opportunity.

00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:04.797
But as I was working on
my third story, I ended up

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.049
criticizing the president,

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:11.130
and questioning the lack
of democracy in Mexico.

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:16.025
In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000,
elections were always rigged;

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.193
the incumbent president
would hand-pick his successor.

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:23.579
That's not true democracy.

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:26.608
To me it seemed like a brilliant idea
to expose the president,

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:27.859
but to my boss --

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:29.716
(Laughter)

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.946
My boss didn't think
it was such a great idea.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.697
At that time, the presidential office,
Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor

00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:37.195
against the media.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.981
My boss, who, aside from being in charge
of the show I worked for,

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.860
was also in charge of a soccer team.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.692
I always suspected that he was more
interested in goals

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.094
than in the news.

00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.436
He censored my report.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.071
He asked me to change it, I said no,

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:56.031
so he put another journalist on the story

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:58.608
to write what I was supposed to say.

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:03.374
I did not want to be
a censored journalist.

00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:05.653
I don't know where I found the strength,

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:07.445
but I wrote my letter of resignation.

00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:12.278
And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --

00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:15.674
I made the most difficult and most
transcendental decision of my life.

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.851
Not only did I resign from television,

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:20.754
but I had also decided
to leave my country.

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:25.045
I sold my car, a beat-up
little red Volkswagen,

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.860
came up with some money

00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:28.658
and said goodbye to my family,

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:29.881
to my friends,

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:31.261
to my streets,

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:33.374
to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos --

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:34.675
(Laughter)

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.896
and I bought a one-way ticket

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.442
to Los Angeles, California.

00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:40.350
And so I became

00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:45.878
one of the 250 million immigrants
that exist in the world.

00:05:45.902 --> 00:05:47.718
Ask any immigrant

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:50.288
about the first day they arrived
in their new country,

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:53.039
and you'll find that they remember
absolutely everything,

00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:55.121
like it was a movie with background music.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:59.137
In my case, I arrived in Los Angeles,
the sun was setting,

00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:00.902
and everything I owned --

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:03.534
a guitar, a suitcase and some documents --

00:06:03.558 --> 00:06:05.419
I could carry all of it

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.118
with my two hands.

00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:10.084
That feeling of absolute freedom,

00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:11.889
I haven't experienced since.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.564
And I survived with what little I had.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.385
I obtained a student visa; I was studying.

00:06:19.976 --> 00:06:22.931
I ate a lot of lettuce and bread,
because that's all I had.

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.034
Finally, in 1984,

00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:30.231
I landed my first job as a TV reporter
in the United States.

00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:34.302
And the first thing I noticed
was that in the US,

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:36.509
my colleagues criticized --
and mercilessly --

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:38.018
then president Ronald Reagan,

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:40.930
and absolutely nothing happened;
no one censored them.

00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:42.194
And I thought:

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:44.164
I love this country.

00:06:44.188 --> 00:06:47.122
(Laughter)

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:50.518
(Applause)

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:52.080
And that's how it's been

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.309
for more than 30 years:

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.111
reporting with total freedom,

00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:00.041
and being treated as an equal
despite being an immigrant --

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:01.715
until, without warning,

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:06.314
I was assigned to cover the recent
US presidential election.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.402
On June 16, 2015,

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:16.241
a candidate who would eventually become
the president of the United States

00:07:16.265 --> 00:07:19.251
said that Mexican immigrants

00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:21.866
were criminals,

00:07:23.096 --> 00:07:24.904
drug traffickers

00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:26.088
and rapists.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.296
And I knew

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:29.277
that he was lying.

00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:32.142
I knew he was wrong
for one very simple reason:

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.678
I'm a Mexican immigrant.

00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:35.636
And we're not like that.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.018
So I did what any other reporter
would have done:

00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:41.818
I wrote him a letter by hand

00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:44.764
requesting an interview,

00:07:44.788 --> 00:07:47.166
and I sent it to his Tower in New York.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.420
The next day

00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:50.304
I was at work,

00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:53.901
and I suddenly began to receive
hundreds of calls and texts

00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:55.414
on my cell phone,

00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:56.980
some more insulting than others.

00:07:57.004 --> 00:08:00.501
I didn't know what was happening
until my friend came into my office

00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:04.293
and said, "They published
your cell number online."

00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:06.873
They actually did that.

00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:11.138
Here's the letter they sent

00:08:11.162 --> 00:08:13.380
where they gave out my number.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.462
Don't bother writing it down, OK?
I already changed it.

00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:17.998
(Laughter)

00:08:18.022 --> 00:08:19.630
But I learned two things.

00:08:19.654 --> 00:08:23.193
The first one is that you should
never, never, ever

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.994
give your cell number to Donald Trump.

00:08:27.018 --> 00:08:29.822
(Laughter)

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:33.222
(Applause)

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:37.583
The second lesson was that
I needed to stop being neutral

00:08:37.607 --> 00:08:38.768
at that point.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.473
From then on, my mission
as a journalist changed.

00:08:41.497 --> 00:08:44.119
I would confront the candidate

00:08:44.143 --> 00:08:45.792
and show that he was wrong,

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:49.166
that what he said about immigrants
in the US was not true.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.608
Let me give you some figures.

00:08:50.632 --> 00:08:54.802
Ninety-seven percent of all undocumented
people in the United States

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.134
are good people.

00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:59.011
Less than three percent
have committed a serious crime,

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:00.767
or "felony," as they say in English.

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:05.361
In comparison, six percent of US citizens
have committed a serious crime.

00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:11.223
The conclusion is that undocumented
immigrants behave much better

00:09:11.247 --> 00:09:12.760
than US citizens.

00:09:12.784 --> 00:09:15.628
Based on that data, I made a plan.

00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:18.977
Eight weeks after they published
my cell number,

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:22.589
I obtained a press pass
for a press conference

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:26.037
for the candidate
gaining momentum in the polls.

00:09:26.062 --> 00:09:27.599
I decided to confront him

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:29.536
in person.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.494
But ...

00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:35.747
things didn't turn out exactly
as I had planned; watch:

00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:40.251
[Donald Trump Press Conference
Dubuque, Iowa]

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:45.909
(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump,
I have a question about immigration.

00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:47.799
Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:50.260
JR: Your immigration plan
is full of empty promises.

00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:52.817
DT: Excuse me, you weren't called.
Sit down. Sit down!

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:55.519
JR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrant
and as a US citizen,

00:09:55.543 --> 00:09:57.218
I have the right to ask a question.

00:09:57.242 --> 00:09:59.525
DT: No you don't.
JR: I have the right to ask --

00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:00.742
DT: Go back to Univision.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.962
JR: This is the question:

00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:04.418
You cannot deport 11 million people.

00:10:04.828 --> 00:10:07.991
You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:11.700
You cannot deny citizenship
to children in this country.

00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:13.665
DT: Sit down.
JR: And with those ideas --

00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:14.841
DT: You weren't called.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.508
JR: I'm a reporter and I have --
Don't touch me, sir.

00:10:17.913 --> 00:10:20.511
Guard 1: Please don't disrupt.
You're being disruptive.

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:24.093
JR: I have the right to ask a question.
G1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir.

00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:26.138
Guard 2: Do you have
your media credential?

00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.315
JR: I have the right --

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:29.348
G2: Where? Let me see.
JR: It's over there.

00:10:29.372 --> 00:10:31.102
Man: Whoever's coming out, stay out.

00:10:31.126 --> 00:10:32.968
G2: You've just got to wait your turn.

00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:35.019
Man: You're very rude. It's not about you.

00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:37.571
JR: It's not about you --
Man: Get out of my country!

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.764
Man: It's not about you.

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.040
JR: I'm a US citizen, too.

00:10:40.064 --> 00:10:42.741
Man: Well ...whatever.
No, Univision. It's not about you.

00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:45.404
JR: It's not about you.
It's about the United States.

00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:51.008
(Applause)

00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:01.081
(Applause ends)

00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:04.606
Whenever I see that video,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.920
the first thing I always
think is that hate

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:09.213
is contagious.

00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:13.527
If you notice, after the candidate says,
"Go back to Univision" -- that's code;

00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:15.746
what he's telling me
is, "Get out of here."

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.607
One member of his entourage,
as if he had been given permission, said,

00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:22.026
"Get out of my country,"

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.854
not knowing that I'm also a US citizen.

00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:29.416
After watching this video many times,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.434
I also think that in order
to break free from neutrality --

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.007
and for it to be a true break --

00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:36.203
one has to lose their fear,

00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:38.432
and then learn how to say, "No;

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.945
I'm not going to be quiet.

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:42.102
I'm not going to sit down.

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:44.248
And I'm not going to leave."

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:46.280
The word "no" --

00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:50.909
(Applause)

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:54.805
"no" is the most powerful word
that exists in any language,

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:58.101
and it always precedes
any important change in our lives.

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.318
And I think there's enormous dignity

00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:02.272
and it generates a great deal of respect

00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:03.825
to be able to step back

00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:05.460
and to push back and say,

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:07.175
"No."

00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:09.781
Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,

00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:11.139
Nobel Peace Prize recipient

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:13.977
and who, unfortunately,
we lost very recently --

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:16.328
said some very wise words:

00:12:16.352 --> 00:12:17.761
"We must take a side.

00:12:18.776 --> 00:12:21.292
Neutrality helps only the oppressor,

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:22.467
never the victim."

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.736
And he's completely right.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.602
We journalists are obligated
to take sides in certain circumstances;

00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:29.055
in cases of racism,

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:30.678
discrimination,

00:12:31.246 --> 00:12:32.617
corruption,

00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:34.125
lying to the public,

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:36.061
dictatorships and human rights,

00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:39.012
we need to set aside
neutrality and indifference.

00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:41.592
Spanish has a great word

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.179
to describe the stance
that journalists should take.

00:12:46.203 --> 00:12:48.441
The word is 
"contrapoder [anti-establishment]."

00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:51.726
Basically, we journalists
should be on the opposite side

00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:53.978
from those in power.

00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:56.576
But if you're in bed with politicians,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.297
if you go to the baptism or wedding
of the governor's son

00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:01.370
or if you want to be
the president's buddy,

00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:03.235
how are you going to criticize them?

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:06.548
When I'm assigned to interview
a powerful or influential person,

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:08.321
I always keep two things in mind:

00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:11.089
if I don't ask this difficult
and uncomfortable question,

00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:12.393
no one else is going to;

00:13:13.718 --> 00:13:16.661
and that I'm never going to see
this person again.

00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:19.825
So I'm not looking to make
a good impression

00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:22.076
or to forge a connection.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.343
In the end, if I have to choose
between being the president's friend

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:26.525
or enemy,

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:29.373
I always prefer to be their enemy.

00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:32.167
In closing:

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.054
I know this is a difficult time
to be an immigrant and a journalist,

00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:39.956
but now more than ever,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.141
we need journalists who are prepared,

00:13:43.165 --> 00:13:44.736
at any given moment,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.554
to set neutrality aside.

00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:50.015
Personally, I feel like
I've been preparing for this moment

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:51.193
my whole life.

00:13:51.217 --> 00:13:53.503
When they censored me when I was 24,

00:13:53.527 --> 00:14:00.197
I learned that neutrality, fear
and silence often make you an accomplice

00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:02.078
in crime, abuse

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.214
and injustice.

00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:06.263
And being an accomplice to power

00:14:06.287 --> 00:14:08.827
is never good journalism.

00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:12.064
Now, at 59 years old,

00:14:12.088 --> 00:14:13.902
I only hope to have a tiny bit

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.917
of the courage and mental
clarity I had at 24,

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:20.414
and that way, never again

00:14:21.285 --> 00:14:22.658
remain quiet.

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:23.950
Thank you very much.

00:14:23.974 --> 00:14:26.613
(Applause)

00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:27.820
Thank you.

00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:29.844
(Applause)
