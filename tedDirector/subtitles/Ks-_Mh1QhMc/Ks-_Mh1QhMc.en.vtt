00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:21.365
So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:23.986
and all it requires of you is this:

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.173
that you change your posture
for two minutes.

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:31.597
But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.190
do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:37.905
So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.250
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.989
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.660
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:50.932
I see you.

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:53.947
So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.305
We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.253
and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.689
it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:07.213
So, we're really fascinated
with body language,

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:11.136
and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.357
You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:19.755
an awkward interaction, or a smile,

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.987
or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,

00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:27.225
or maybe even something like a handshake.

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.574
Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:35.067
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.

00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.994
Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:42.669
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:46.376
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.900
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.040
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:54.991
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.379
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:01.259
it's language, so we think
about communication.

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:04.286
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.725
So what is your body language
communicating to me?

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.791
What's mine communicating to you?

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:14.763
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:17.031
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:19.136
looking at the effects
of our body language,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.445
or other people's body language,
on judgments.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.884
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:28.874
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.667
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:37.352
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:41.824
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.848
of real physician-patient interactions,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.681
their judgments
of the physician's niceness

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.318
predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.000
So it doesn't have to do so much

00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:54.523
with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.353
but do we like that person
and how they interacted?

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.288
Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.965
has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.933
in just one second predict 70 percent

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:11.783
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:14.005
and even, let's go digital,

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.150
emoticons used well in online negotiations

00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:20.982
can lead you to claim more value
from that negotiation.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:24.205
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.302
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:30.204
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:32.324
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:35.759
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.972
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:41.335
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.398
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:47.341
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.068
and I teach at a competitive
business school,

00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:54.552
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:58.364
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.367
of power and dominance.

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:03.106
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.189
Well, this is what they are.

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:08.067
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.077
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.018
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:15.964
It's about opening up.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.719
And this is true
across the animal kingdom.

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.768
It's not just limited to primates.

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:24.188
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:27.899
So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,

00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:30.900
and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.

00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:33.972
And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:37.994
how universal and old these
expressions of power are.

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.593
This expression, which is known as pride,

00:04:40.617 --> 00:04:42.846
Jessica Tracy has studied.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.753
She shows that people
who are born with sight

00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:48.694
and people who are congenitally
blind do this

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:51.008
when they win at a physical competition.

00:04:51.032 --> 00:04:53.486
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.987
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.304
They do this.

00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:59.826
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.913
What do we do when we feel powerless?

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:03.692
We do exactly the opposite.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:06.220
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:07.588
We make ourselves small.

00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:09.968
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:12.725
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.705
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.831
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:22.484
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:24.915
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.559
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.173
We do the opposite of them.

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:32.372
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:34.909
and what do I notice?

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:42.162
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.710
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:48.115
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.552
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:53.815
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.573
They raise their hands like this.

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:58.208
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:00.732
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.025
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:05.843
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.205
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.087
I notice a couple of things about this.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.921
One, you're not going to be surprised.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:13.963
It seems to be related to gender.

00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:19.428
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:22.014
Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,

00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:23.896
so this is not surprising.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.969
But the other thing I noticed

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:28.635
is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.495
to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.077
And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,

00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.758
because participation
counts for half the grade.

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:42.231
So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:45.503
You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in

00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.670
and then you get
these differences in grades,

00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.759
and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:53.782
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:57.424
so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.

00:06:57.448 --> 00:06:59.977
Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it

00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:02.001
and would it lead them
to participate more?

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:06.614
So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,

00:07:06.638 --> 00:07:10.169
and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.720
Like, can you do this
just for a little while

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:15.396
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.122
that makes you seem more powerful?

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:20.574
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people

00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.979
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.

00:07:23.003 --> 00:07:24.425
But our question really was,

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.489
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:31.179
There's some evidence that they do.

00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:35.815
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.993
but also, when we're forced to smile

00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:42.408
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.

00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:44.350
So it goes both ways.

00:07:44.374 --> 00:07:48.156
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.704
So when you feel powerful,

00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:52.499
you're more likely to do this,

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:58.701
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:02.124
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.184
So the second question
really was, you know,

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.767
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:12.184
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.911
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,

00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:16.283
what am I talking about?

00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:18.449
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:22.045
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:25.112
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:29.446
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.742
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:37.966
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.276
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.144
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:47.788
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.

00:08:47.812 --> 00:08:51.051
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.895
Physiologically,
there also are differences

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:57.960
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,

00:08:57.984 --> 00:09:01.654
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:08.799
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies

00:09:08.823 --> 00:09:11.997
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:14.929
and powerful and effective leaders

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:17.778
also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.

00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:20.183
So what does that mean?
When you think about power,

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:22.506
people tended to think
only about testosterone,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.294
because that was about dominance.

00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:27.764
But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.

00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:30.893
So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.635
high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:35.200
Probably not, right?

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:38.254
You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:41.942
but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:47.092
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:50.184
if an alpha needs to take over,

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:54.422
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,

00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:57.533
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up

00:09:57.557 --> 00:10:01.038
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.

00:10:01.062 --> 00:10:04.079
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.445
the mind, at least at the facial level,

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:10.574
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:13.356
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.940
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,

00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:18.393
like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.227
"For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,

00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:23.787
and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.741
So this is what we did.

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:31.356
We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.905
and these people adopted, for two minutes,

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:38.389
either high-power poses
or low-power poses,

00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:40.730
and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,

00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:42.315
although they took on only two.

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:43.819
So here's one.

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:46.358
A couple more.

00:10:47.052 --> 00:10:51.805
This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.204
Here are a couple more.

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:55.558
So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.

00:10:55.582 --> 00:10:57.543
And here are the low-power poses.

00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:00.297
So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.

00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:03.345
This one is very low-power.

00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:07.328
When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.

00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:09.349
So this is what happens.

00:11:09.467 --> 00:11:11.673
They come in, they spit into a vial,

00:11:11.697 --> 00:11:14.846
for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.911
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:19.462
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:21.119
We want them to be feeling power.

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:22.478
So two minutes they do this.

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:25.687
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,

00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:28.054
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:30.819
and then we take another saliva sample.

00:11:30.843 --> 00:11:32.701
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.286
So this is what we find.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.190
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:40.328
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,

00:11:40.352 --> 00:11:42.486
86 percent of you will gamble.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.606
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.606
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.086
Here's what we find on testosterone.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.623
From their baseline when they come in,

00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:56.953
high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,

00:11:56.977 --> 00:12:01.574
and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.

00:12:01.598 --> 00:12:04.391
So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.392
Here's what you get on cortisol.

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:10.190
High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,

00:12:10.214 --> 00:12:14.322
and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.

00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:17.054
So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes

00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.698
that configure your brain

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:22.999
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,

00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:28.076
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.863
And we've all had the feeling, right?

00:12:30.887 --> 00:12:36.071
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:38.527
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.

00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:40.954
Also, our bodies change our minds.

00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:43.360
But the next question, of course,

00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:45.204
is, can power posing for a few minutes

00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:47.265
really change your life
in meaningful ways?

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:51.582
This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:53.347
Where can you actually apply this?

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.182
Which we cared about, of course.

00:12:55.206 --> 00:13:01.947
And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,

00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:04.424
like social threat situations.

00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:07.004
Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?

00:13:07.028 --> 00:13:09.085
For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.

00:13:09.109 --> 00:13:13.382
For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:17.170
It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:19.968
or doing a job interview.

00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:22.660
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to

00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:25.579
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.

00:13:25.603 --> 00:13:28.334
So we published these findings,

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.919
and the media are all over it,

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.018
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:34.115
when you go in
for the job interview, right?

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.146
(Laughter)

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.617
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,

00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:39.913
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.

00:13:39.937 --> 00:13:42.177
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:44.768
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.

00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:46.353
It's you talking to yourself.

00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:49.436
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.002
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --

00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:54.288
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:56.182
You're looking at your notes,

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:58.206
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.659
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:03.720
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:05.506
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.324
So we bring people into a lab,

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:10.701
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.333
they go through
a very stressful job interview.

00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:16.949
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.

00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:18.930
They're being judged also,

00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:23.435
and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:25.018
so they look like this.

00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:27.326
Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.949
So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.

00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:33.613
People hate this.

00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:37.353
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.162
So this really spikes your cortisol.

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:41.472
So this is the job interview
we put them through,

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.693
because we really wanted
to see what happened.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.800
We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:49.972
They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.

00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:52.757
They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:57.847
and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,

00:14:57.871 --> 00:15:00.019
and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"

00:15:00.043 --> 00:15:01.544
all the high-power posers.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.341
"We don't want to hire these people.

00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:07.182
We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.846
But what's driving it?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.862
It's not about the content of the speech.

00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:13.738
It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.

00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:16.239
Because we rate them
on all these variables

00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:19.802
related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:22.060
How good is it?
What are their qualifications?

00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:24.710
No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:26.433
These kinds of things.

00:15:26.457 --> 00:15:28.848
People are bringing
their true selves, basically.

00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:30.262
They're bringing themselves.

00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:32.385
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.621
with no, you know, residue over them.

00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:39.552
So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.

00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:42.920
So when I tell people about this,

00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:46.299
that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:49.075
and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,

00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:50.642
"It feels fake." Right?

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.544
So I said, fake it till you make it.

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.421
It's not me.

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:57.596
I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.430
I don't want to feel like an impostor.

00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:03.527
I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.

00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:05.714
And that really resonated with me,

00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:08.960
because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:11.182
and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.

00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:14.123
When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:17.528
I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:19.410
I was thrown from the car.

00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:22.398
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,

00:16:22.422 --> 00:16:24.631
and I had been withdrawn from college,

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:30.343
and I learned that my IQ had dropped
by two standard deviations,

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:32.931
which was very traumatic.

00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:35.802
I knew my IQ because
I had identified with being smart,

00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:37.814
and I had been called gifted as a child.

00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:41.014
So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.

00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:43.238
They say, "You're not going
to finish college.

00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:45.815
Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.839
but that's not going to work out for you."

00:16:47.863 --> 00:16:51.397
So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:54.171
having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:56.030
and for me it was being smart,

00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.693
having that taken from you,

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.816
there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.619
So I felt entirely powerless.

00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:04.505
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,

00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:06.375
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:08.627
Eventually I graduated from college.

00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.651
It took me four years
longer than my peers,

00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:14.992
and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:17.936
to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.787
and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:22.081
I am an impostor.

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:24.010
And the night before my first-year talk,

00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:27.533
and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.

00:17:27.557 --> 00:17:28.735
That's it.

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:31.222
I was so afraid of being
found out the next day

00:17:31.246 --> 00:17:34.035
that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:35.891
She was like, "You are not quitting,

00:17:35.915 --> 00:17:38.449
because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.

00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:41.240
You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.

00:17:41.264 --> 00:17:42.597
You are going to fake it.

00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:45.777
You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.

00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:48.040
You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,

00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:50.485
even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:52.858
and having an out-of-body experience,

00:17:52.882 --> 00:17:56.228
until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

00:17:56.252 --> 00:17:59.194
Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"

00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:00.313
So that's what I did.

00:18:00.337 --> 00:18:01.721
Five years in grad school,

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:03.845
a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,

00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:05.932
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,

00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:09.932
I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:11.738
"Not supposed to be here."

00:18:11.762 --> 00:18:14.455
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,

00:18:14.479 --> 00:18:18.780
a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,

00:18:18.804 --> 00:18:22.471
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"

00:18:22.495 --> 00:18:25.019
came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.

00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:28.471
She came in totally defeated,
and she said,

00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:31.621
"I'm not supposed to be here."

00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.328
And that was the moment for me.

00:18:37.352 --> 00:18:38.944
Because two things happened.

00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.238
One was that I realized,

00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:43.372
oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:46.396
I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.691
And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!

00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:50.668
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:54.235
So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.021
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,

00:18:56.045 --> 00:18:58.734
you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --

00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:04.151
(Applause)

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:08.229
And you're going to go
into the classroom,

00:19:08.253 --> 00:19:10.653
and you are going to give
the best comment ever."

00:19:10.677 --> 00:19:13.658
You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,

00:19:13.682 --> 00:19:15.621
and people turned around and were like,

00:19:15.645 --> 00:19:18.565
oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)

00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:20.382
She comes back to me months later,

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:23.446
and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.844
she had actually faked it
till she became it.

00:19:25.868 --> 00:19:27.667
So she had changed.

00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:31.751
And so I want to say to you,
don't fake it till you make it.

00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:34.548
Fake it till you become it.

00:19:34.572 --> 00:19:38.189
Do it enough until you actually
become it and internalize.

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:40.844
The last thing I'm going
to leave you with is this.

00:19:40.868 --> 00:19:45.316
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.813
So, this is two minutes.

00:19:47.837 --> 00:19:49.647
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:52.795
Before you go into the next stressful
evaluative situation,

00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:55.501
for two minutes, try doing this,
in the elevator,

00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:58.740
in a bathroom stall, at your desk
behind closed doors.

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.167
That's what you want to do.

00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:03.002
Configure your brain
to cope the best in that situation.

00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:05.967
Get your testosterone up.
Get your cortisol down.

00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:09.933
Don't leave that situation feeling
like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

00:20:09.957 --> 00:20:11.657
Leave that situation feeling like,

00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:14.653
I really feel like I got to say
who I am and show who I am.

00:20:14.677 --> 00:20:20.444
So I want to ask you first, you know,
both to try power posing,

00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:25.558
and also I want to ask you to share
the science, because this is simple.

00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:27.735
I don't have ego involved in this.
(Laughter)

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.522
Give it away. Share it with people,

00:20:29.546 --> 00:20:31.966
because the people who can use it the most

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.341
are the ones with no resources
and no technology

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:37.539
and no status and no power.

00:20:37.563 --> 00:20:40.111
Give it to them
because they can do it in private.

00:20:40.135 --> 00:20:42.579
They need their bodies,
privacy and two minutes,

00:20:42.603 --> 00:20:45.729
and it can significantly change
the outcomes of their life.

00:20:45.753 --> 00:20:46.884
Thank you.

00:20:46.908 --> 00:20:49.939
(Applause)
