00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.576
Our grandparents' generation
created an amazing system

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.176
of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.616
for people to live in places
where there wasn't a lot of water.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.176
For example, during the Great Depression,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.816
they created the Hoover Dam,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.256
which in turn, created Lake Mead

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.896
and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.656
and Los Angeles to provide water

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.880
for people who lived
in a really dry place.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.656
In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.096
building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.056
In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.056
But in the last decade,
we've seen the combined effects

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.856
of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.536
threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.696
This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.976
that happened in the last 15 years.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.336
You can see starting around the year 2000,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.256
the lake level started to drop.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.096
And it was dropping at such a rate

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.000
that it would have left the drinking water
intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.456
The city became so concerned about this

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.416
that they recently constructed
a new drinking water intake structure

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.496
that they referred to as the "Third Straw"

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.240
to pull water out
of the greater depths of the lake.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.736
The challenges associated
with providing water to a modern city

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.816
are not restricted
to the American Southwest.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.176
In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.136
came within 6 months
of running out of water.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.416
A similar drama is playing out today
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.256
where the main reservoir for the city

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.176
has gone from being
completely full in 2010,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.376
to being nearly empty today

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.880
as the city approaches
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.536
For those of us who are fortunate enough

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.616
to live in one
of the world's great cities,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.776
we've never truly experienced
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.536
We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.936
We like our neighbors to see
our dirty cars and our brown lawns.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.496
But we've never really faced
the prospect of turning on the tap

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040
and having nothing come out.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.736
And that's because when things
have gotten bad in the past,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.816
it's always been possible
to expand a reservoir

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.040
or dig a few more groundwater wells.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.936
Well, in a time when all
of the water resources are spoken for,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.336
it's not going to be possible
to rely on this tried and true way

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.696
of providing ourselves with water.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.496
Some people think that we're going
to solve the urban water problem

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520
by taking water from our rural neighbors.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.656
But that's an approach that's fraught
with political, legal and social dangers.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.216
And even if we succeed in grabbing
the water from our rural neighbors,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.736
we're just transferring
the problem to someone else

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.376
and there's a good chance
it will come back and bite us

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.296
in the form of higher food prices

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.280
and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
that already rely upon that water.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.576
I think that there's a better way
to solve our urban water crisis

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.016
and I think that's to open up
four new local sources of water

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.776
that I liken to faucets.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.896
If we can make smart investments
in these new sources of water

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.216
in the coming years,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.576
we can solve our urban water problem

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.936
and decrease the likelihood
that we'll ever run across

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.200
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.336
Now, if you told me 20 years ago

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.976
that a modern city could exist
without a supply of imported water,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.640
I probably would have dismissed you
as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.016
But my own experiences

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.416
working with some of the world's most
water-starved cities in the last decades

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.376
have shown me that we have
the technologies and the management skills

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.296
to actually transition away
from imported water,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.640
and that's what I want
to tell you about tonight.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.616
The first source of local water
supply that we need to develop

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.776
to solve our urban water problem

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.056
will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.496
One of the great tragedies
of urban development

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.496
is that as our cities grew,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.176
we started covering all the surfaces
with concrete and asphalt.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.616
And when we did that,
we had to build storm sewers

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.736
to get the water
that fell on the cities out

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.696
before it could cause flooding,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.560
and that's a waste
of a vital water resource.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.976
Let me give you an example.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.216
This figure here shows you
the volume of water

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.856
that could be collected
in the city of San Jose

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.656
if they could harvest the stormwater
that fell within the city limits.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.456
You can see from the intersection
of the blue line and the black dotted line

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.776
that if San Jose could just capture half
of the water that fell within the city,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.136
they'd have enough water
to get them through an entire year.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.776
Now, I know what some of you
are probably thinking.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.376
"The answer to our problem
is to start building great big tanks

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.256
and attaching them
to the downspouts of our roof gutters,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.520
rainwater harvesting."

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.576
Now, that's an idea
that might work in some places.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.856
But if you live in a place
where it mainly rains in the winter time

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.296
and most of the water demand
is in the summertime,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.056
it's not a very cost-effective way
to solve a water problem.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.096
And if you experience the effects
of a multiyear drought,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.296
like California's currently experiencing,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.536
you just can't build a rainwater tank
that's big enough to solve your problem.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.576
I think there's a lot more practical way

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.096
to harvest the stormwater and
the rainwater that falls in our cities,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.896
and that's to capture it
and let it percolate into the ground.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.096
After all, many of our cities are sitting
on top of a natural water storage system

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.520
that can accommodate
huge volumes of water.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.896
For example, historically,
Los Angeles has obtained

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.936
about a third of its water supply
from a massive aquifer

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.000
that underlies the San Fernando Valley.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.176
Now, when you look at the water
that comes off of your roof

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.656
and runs off of your lawn
and flows down the gutter,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.800
you might say to yourself,
"Do I really want to drink that stuff?"

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.696
Well, the answer is
you don't want to drink it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.536
until it's been treated a little bit.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.656
And so the challenge that we face
in urban water harvesting

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.416
is to capture the water, clean the water

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.680
and get it underground.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.536
And that's exactly
what the city of Los Angeles is doing

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.656
with a new project that they're building
in Burbank, California.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.776
This figure here shows
the stormwater park that they're building

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.976
by hooking a series of stormwater
collection systems, or storm sewers,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.576
and routing that water
into an abandoned gravel quarry.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.496
The water that's captured in the quarry

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.296
is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.936
and then it goes
into that ball field there

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.896
and percolates into the ground,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.280
recharging the drinking water
aquifer of the city.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.976
And in the process
of passing through the wetland

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.776
and percolating through the ground,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.296
the water encounters microbes
that live on the surfaces of the plants

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.896
and the surfaces of the soil,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.400
and that purifies the water.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.536
And if the water's
still not clean enough to drink

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.256
after it's been through
this natural treatment process,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.616
the city can treat it again

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.216
when they pump if back out
of the groundwater aquifers

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.320
before they deliver it to people to drink.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.816
The second tap that we need to open up
to solve our urban water problem

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.296
will flow with the wastewater

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.480
that comes out
of our sewage treatment plants.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.837
Now, many of you are probably familiar
with the concept of recycled water.

00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:28.736
You've probably seen signs like this

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.016
that tell you that the shrubbery
and the highway median

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.536
and the local golf course

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.416
is being watered with water

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.720
that used to be
in a sewage treatment plant.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.336
We've been doing this
for a couple of decades now.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.376
But what we're learning
from our experience

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.496
is that this approach is much more
expensive that we expected it to be.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.616
Because once we build
the first few water recycling systems

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.416
close to the sewage treatment plant,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.679
we have to build longer
and longer pipe networks

00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:56.863
to get that water to where it needs to go.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.400
And that becomes prohibitive
in terms of cost.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.216
What we're finding is

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.256
that a much more cost-effective
and practical way of recycling wastewater

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.856
is to turn treated wastewater
into drinking water

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.400
through a two-step process.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.216
In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.976
and pass it through
a reverse osmosis membrane:

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.416
a thin, permeable plastic membrane

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.976
that allows water molecules
to pass through

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.776
but traps and retains the salts,
the viruses and the organic chemicals

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.720
that might be present in the wastewater.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.456
In the second step in the process,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.976
we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.696
and shine ultraviolet light on the water.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.616
The ultraviolet light
cleaves the hydrogen peroxide

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.776
into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.895
and these hydroxyl radicals
are very potent forms of oxygen

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:49.320
that break down most organic chemicals.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.176
After the water's been
through this two-stage process,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.816
it's safe to drink.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.096
I know,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.696
I've been studying recycled water

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.136
using every measurement technique
known to modern science

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.600
for the past 15 years.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.736
We've detected some chemicals

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.336
that can make it through
the first step in the process,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.360
but by the time we get to the second step,

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.296
the advanced oxidation process,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.736
we rarely see any chemicals present.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.936
And that's in stark contrast
to the taken-for-granted water supplies

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.840
that we regularly drink all the time.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.416
There's another way we can recycle water.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.536
This is an engineered treatment wetland
that we recently built

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.336
on the Santa Ana River
in Southern California.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.456
The treatment wetland receives water
from a part of the Santa Ana River

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.096
that in the summertime consists
almost entirely of wastewater effluent

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.136
from cities like Riverside
and San Bernardino.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.216
The water comes
into our treatment wetland,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.576
it's exposed to sunlight and algae

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.096
and those break down
the organic chemicals,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.656
remove the nutrients
and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.136
The water gets put back
in the Santa Ana River,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.056
it flows down to Anaheim,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.336
gets taken out at Anaheim
and percolated into the ground,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.016
and becomes the drinking water
of the city of Anaheim,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.976
completing the trip
from the sewers of Riverside County

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.280
to the drinking water supply
of Orange County.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.416
Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.856
is some sort of futuristic fantasy
or not commonly done.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.256
Well, in California, we already recycle
about 40 billion gallons a year

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.376
of wastewater through the two-stage
advanced treatment process

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.696
I was telling you about.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.456
That's enough water to be
the supply of about a million people

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.240
if it were their sole water supply.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.496
The third tap that we need to open up
will not be a tap at all,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.136
it will be a kind of virtual tap,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.256
it will be the water conservation
that we manage to do.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.736
And the place where we need to think
about water conservation is outdoors

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.376
because in California
and other modern American cities,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.800
about half of our water use
happens outdoors.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.216
In the current drought,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.816
we've seen that it's possible

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.816
to have our lawns survive
and our plants survive

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.736
with about half as much water.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.776
So there's no need
to start painting concrete green

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.896
and putting in Astroturf
and buying cactuses.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.136
We can have California-friendly
landscaping with soil moisture detectors

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.056
and smart irrigation controllers

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.520
and have beautiful
green landscapes in our cities.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.776
The fourth and final water tap
that we need to open up

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.696
to solve our urban water problem

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.760
will flow with desalinated seawater.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.336
Now, I know what you probably heard
people say about seawater desalination.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.536
"It's a great thing to do if you have
lots of oil, not a lot of water

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.936
and you don't care about climate change."

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.296
Seawater desalination is energy-intensive
no matter how you slice it.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.936
But that characterization
of seawater desalination

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.976
as being a nonstarter
is hopelessly out of date.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.776
We've made tremendous progress
in seawater desalination

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.040
in the past two decades.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.576
This picture shows you

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.576
the largest seawater desalination plant
in the Western hemisphere

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.416
that's currently being built
north of San Diego.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.696
Compared to the seawater
desalination plant

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.016
that was built in
Santa Barbara 25 years ago,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.696
this treatment plant
will use about half the energy

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.240
to produce a gallon of water.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.576
But just because seawater desalination
has become less energy-intensive,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.839
doesn't mean we should start building
desalination plants everywhere.

00:12:14.863 --> 00:12:16.599
Among the different choices we have,

00:12:16.623 --> 00:12:18.736
it's probably the most energy-intensive

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.696
and potentially environmentally damaging

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.640
of the options to create
a local water supply.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.776
So there it is.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.576
With these four sources of water,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.920
we can move away
from our reliance on imported water.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.176
Through reform in the way we landscape
our surfaces and our properties,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.296
we can reduce outdoor water use
by about 50 percent,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.776
thereby increasing 
the water supply by 25 percent.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.324
We can recycle the water
that makes it into the sewer,

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:48.428
thereby increasing
our water supply by 40 percent.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.496
And we can make up the difference
through a combination

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.000
of stormwater harvesting
and seawater desalination.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.096
So, let's create a water supply

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.776
that will be able
to withstand any of the challenges

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.376
that climate change throws at us
in the coming years.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.736
Let's create a water supply
that uses local sources

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.800
and leaves more water
in the environment for fish and for food.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.656
Let's create a water system that's
consistent with out environmental values.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.136
And let's do it for our children
and our grandchildren

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.776
and let's tell them this is the system

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.136
that they have to
take care of in the future

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.096
because it's our last chance
to create a new kind of water system.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.978
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:35.922
(Applause)
