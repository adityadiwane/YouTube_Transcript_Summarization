00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
and I don't like being 60.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
(Laughter)

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
And I started grappling

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
with this existential angst

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
of what little I had done with my life.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
It wasn't the resume

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
of breaking this record here,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
it was more like, who had I become?

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
How had I spent my valuable time?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
How could this have gone by

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
like lightning?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.330
And I couldn't forgive myself

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
for the countless, countless hours

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I had lost

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
in negative thought --

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
all the time I had spent beating myself up

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
for losing my marriage

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and career moves

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
and this and this and this.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Just why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
And then my mother died at 82.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
And so I starting thinking,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
not only am I not happy with the past,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
now I'm getting choked with,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
"I've only got 22 years left."

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
What am I going to do with this short amount of time

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
that's just fleeting?

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
And I'm not in the present whatsoever.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And I decided the remedy to all this malaise

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
was going to be

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
for me to chase

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
an elevated dream,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
an extreme dream,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
something that would require

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
utter conviction

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and unwavering passion,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
something that would make me

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
be my best self

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
in every aspect of my life,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
every minute of every day,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
because the dream was so big

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
that I couldn't get there

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And I decided,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
it was an old dream that was lingering,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
that was from so many years ago,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
three decades ago --

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
the only sort of world class swim

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
I had tried and failed at back in my 20s --

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
was going from Cuba to Florida.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
It was deep in my imagination.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
No one's ever done it without a shark cage.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
It's daunting.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
It's probably, at my speed, at my age --

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
for anybody's speed at anybody's age --

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
going to take 60, maybe 70, hours

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
of continuous swimming,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
never getting out on the boat.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And I started to train.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
As a matter of fact,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
this picture is supposed to be me during training.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
It's a smiling face.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
And when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
(Laughter)

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
It's an arduous, difficult sport,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
and I don't remember smiling

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
at any time during this sport.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
As I said, I respect other sports,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
and I compare this sport sometimes

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
to cycling and to mountain climbing

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
and other of the expedition type events,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
but this is a sensory deprivation,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
a physical duress.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And when I started in

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
I knew I had it,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
because I was making it through these.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
and we're coming into the dock after a long day

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
and it's now night,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
and I can touch the dock and we're done,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
the trainer says, "That's great.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
It's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?"

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
I say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours,"

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
and I swim another minute out and another minute back

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
to make the 15 hours.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And I put together an expedition.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
It's not that I didn't have help,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
And to get the government permissions,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
you read in the paper,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Try going in with an armada like we had

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
of 50 people and five boats

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
and CNN's crew, etc.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
The navigation is difficult.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
There's a big river called the Gulf Stream

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
that runs across

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
and it's not going in the direction you are.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
It's going to the east and you'd like to go north.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
It's tricky.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
And there's dehydration.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And there's hypothermia.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
And there are sharks.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
And there are all kinds of problems.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And I gathered together, honestly,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
the world's leading experts in every possible way.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And a month ago,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
the 23rd of September,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
I stood on that shore

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
and I looked across

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
to that long, long faraway horizon

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
and I asked myself,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
do you have it?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Are your shoulders ready?

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And they were. They were prepared.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
No stone left unturned.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Was the mind ready?

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
you're swimming at 60 strokes a minute,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
so you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
You've got tight bathing caps over your ears

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
trying to keep the heat of the head,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
because it's where the hypothermia starts,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
and so you don't hear very well.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
You're really left alone with your own thoughts.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
in English, followed by German,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.330
followed by Spanish, followed by French.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
You save the French for last.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head --

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
not through headphones, in my own head --

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
of 65 songs.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
because that's when Neil Young comes out.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
(Laughter)

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
And it's odd, isn't it?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah"

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
out in the majesty of the ocean,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
not songs about heroin addiction in New York City.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
But no, for some reason

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and be singing,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
♫ "A heard you knocking at my cellar door ♫

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
♫ I love you baby and I want some more ♫

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.330
♫ Ooh, ooh, the damage done" ♫

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.330
(Applause)

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
The night before I started,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
I finished Stephen Hawking's "The Grand Design."

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
And I couldn't wait

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
to trip the mind fantastic.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
About the 50th hour,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Is there an edge?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Is this an envelope we're living inside of,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
or no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
And there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
that gets you thinking about things like this.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
that nobody else in the world can do this swim.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
And I knew I could do it.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
And when I jumped into that water,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
I yelled in my mother's French, "Courage!"

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
And I started swimming,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and, oh my God, it was glassy.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
And we knew it, all 50 people on the boat,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
we all knew this was it,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
this was our time.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And I reminded myself a couple hours in,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
you know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
First of all, you're going to hit obstacles.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
don't take it for granted, be ready,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
because there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
It's not going to feel this good all the way across.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
And I was thinking of the hypothermia

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and maybe some shoulder pain

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
and all the other things --

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
You're immersed in the liquid.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
Your body doesn't like the saltwater.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
After a couple of days, three days,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
you tend to rebel

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
in a lot of physical ways.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
But no, two hours in,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
wham! Never in my life ...

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
I knew there were Portuguese men o' war,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
is not supposed to be in these waters.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
And I was on fire --

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
excruciating, excruciating pain.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
I don't know if you can still see

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
the red line here and up the arm.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
Evidently, a piece this big of tentacle

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.330
has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
and each barb is not just stinging your skin,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
it's sending a venom.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
is the box jellyfish.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
And every one of those barbs

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
is sending that venom into this central nervous system.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
So first I feel like boiling hot oil,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
I've been dipped in.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
And I'm yelling out, "Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Help me! Somebody help me!"

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
And the next thing is paralysis.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
and I can't breathe.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
I'm sort of crabbing it this way.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Then come convulsions.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
He's stung.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
They drag him out on the boat,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
and he's -- evidently, I didn't see any of this -- but lying on the boat

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and giving himself epinephrine shots

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and crying out.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
He's 29 years old,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
very well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
weighs 265 lbs.,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
and he is down.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
who's trying to help me.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
And he's saying, "Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
My breath is down to three breaths a minute.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
I need help, and I can't help Diana."

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
So that was at eight o'clock at night.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
The doctor, medical team from University of Miami

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
arrived at five in the morning.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
So I swam through the night,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
I didn't get out,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
but was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
oxygen to the face.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
It was like an ICU unit

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
in the water.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
(Laughter)

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
And I guess the story is

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
they're done.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
And the next night at dusk,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
again, wham!

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
The box jelly again --

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
all across the neck, all across here.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
And this time,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
I don't like it, I didn't want to give into it,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
but there's a difference between a non-stop swim

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
and a staged swim.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
And I gave in

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
to the staged swim.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
And they got me out and they started again

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
with the epinephrine and the prednisone

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
And I got back in.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
And I swam through that night and into the next day.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
And at 41 hours,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.330
this body couldn't make it.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
The devastation of those stings

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
had taken the respiratory system down

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
And the dream was crushed.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
And how odd

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
is this intelligent person who put this together

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
and got all these world experts together.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
And I knew about the jellyfish,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
but I was sort of cavalier.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
A lot of athletes have this, you know,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.330
sort of invincibility.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
They should worry about me. I don't worry about them.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
I'll just swim right through them.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Well there was no grin and bearing this.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
As a matter of fact, the best advice I got

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
was from an elementary school class

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
in the Caribbean.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
And I was telling these kids, 120 of them --

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor --

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and I was telling them about the jellyfish

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
and how they're gelatinous

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
and you can't see them at night especially.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
And they have these

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
And they do this wrapping.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
And they can send the poison into the system.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
And a little kid from the back was like this.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
And I said, "What's your name?" "Henry."

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
"Henry, what's your question?"

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
He said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
as I had a suggestion."

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
He said, "You know those guys

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
who really believe in what they believe in

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
and so they wear bombs?"

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
And I said, "Well it's odd that you've learned of this

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
as a noble kind of pursuit, but yeah, I know those guys."

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
He said, "That's what you need.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
You need like a school of fish

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
that would swim in front of you like this."

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
(Laughter)

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
"And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
they're going to be busy with them,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
and you'll just scoot around."

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
I said, "Oh, it's like a suicide army."

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
He said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need."

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
And little did I know,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
that you should listen to eight year-olds.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
And so I started that swim

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
in a bathing suit like normal,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
and, no joke, this is it; it came from the shark divers.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
I finished the swim like this.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
I was swimming with this thing on.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
That's how scared of the jellyfish I was.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
So now what do I do?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
I wouldn't mind

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
if every one of you came up on this stage tonight

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Because we've all had them, haven't we?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
We've all had a heartache.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
And so my journey now

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
is to find some sort of grace

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
in the face of this defeat.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
And I can look at the journey,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
not just the destination.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
and say I was courageous.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
Yeah.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.330
(Applause)

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
Thank you.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
And with all sincerity, I can say,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
I got there with that goal.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
When you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
there's no time, there's no time for regrets,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
you're just moving forward.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
swim or no swim.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
But the difference

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
in accepting this particular defeat

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
is that sometimes,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.330
if cancer has won,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
if there's death and we have no choice,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
then grace and acceptance

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
are necessary.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
But that ocean's still there.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
This hope is still alive.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
And I don't want to be the crazy woman

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
who does it for years and years and years,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
but I can swim from Cuba to Florida,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and I will swim from Cuba to Florida.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
Thank you.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
Thank you.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
(Applause)

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
Thank you.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
(Applause)

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
And so, what after that?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
Are you going to swim the Atlantic?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
No, that's the last swim.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
It's the only swim I'm interested in.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
But I'm ready.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
And by the way, a reporter called me the other day

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
and he said he looked on Wikipedia

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
and he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
and for some odd reason in Wikipedia,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
they had my death date too.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
(Laughter)

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.330
He said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
and it's going to be in January of '35?"

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
I said, "Nope. I didn't know."

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
And now I'm going to live to 85.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
I have three more years than I thought.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
And so I ask myself,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
I'm starting to ask myself now,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
even before this extreme dream

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
gets achieved for me,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
I'm asking myself,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
and maybe I can ask you tonight too,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.330
to paraphrase the poet

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
Mary Oliver,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.330
she says, "So what is it,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
what is it you're doing,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
with this one wild and precious life of yours?"

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
Thank you very much.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:37.330
(Applause)

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.330
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.330
(Applause)

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
Live it large. Live it large.
