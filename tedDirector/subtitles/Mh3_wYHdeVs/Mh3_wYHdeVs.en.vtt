00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.395
An image is worth more than a thousand words,

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.522
so I'm going to start my talk

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:21.190
by stop talking and show you a few images

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.357
that I recently captured.

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:46.742
So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:48.890
and I feel like I should stop here.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.310
(Laughter)

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.131
At the same time, I probably owe you

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.137
some explanation

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.240
about the images that you just saw.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.963
What I am trying to do as a photographer,

00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:02.446
as an artist, is to bring the world

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.823
of art and science together.

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:08.162
Whether it is an image of a soap bubble

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.928
captured at the very moment where it's bursting,

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:13.400
as you can see in this image,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.008
whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.506
of oil paint,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:22.849
strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.115
or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.081
I'm always trying to link those two fields together.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.471
What I find very intriguing about those two

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.750
is that they both look at the same thing:

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.574
They are a response to their surroundings.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:43.467
And yet, they do it in a very different way.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.514
If you look at science on one hand,

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:48.937
science is a very rational approach

00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:50.418
to its surroundings,

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:52.507
whereas art on the other hand

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:56.810
is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.827
What I am trying to do is I'm trying

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.468
to bring those two views into one

00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:05.418
so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:08.612
but also to the viewer's brain.

00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:13.278
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:18.332
The first one has to do with making sound visible.

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:19.350
Now as you may know,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.976
sound travels in waves,

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.299
so if you have a speaker,

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.348
a speaker actually does nothing else

00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:28.232
than taking the audio signal,

00:02:28.232 --> 00:02:31.829
transform it into a vibration,

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.530
which is then transported through the air,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.392
is captured by our ear,

00:02:36.392 --> 00:02:39.933
and transformed into an audio signal again.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:41.779
Now I was thinking,

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.999
how can I make those sound waves visible?

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.115
So I came up with the following setup.

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:51.835
I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil

00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:54.070
of plastic on top of that speaker,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.737
and then I added tiny little crystals

00:02:56.737 --> 00:02:58.714
on top of that speaker.

00:02:58.714 --> 00:03:01.614
And now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.496
it would cause the crystals to move up and down.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.795
Now this happens very fast,

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:09.747
in the blink of an eye,

00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:13.434
so, together with LG, we captured this motion

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:15.120
with a camera that is able

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.595
to capture more than 3,000 frames per second.

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:22.068
Let me show you what this looks like.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:27.435
(Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack)

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:08.724
(Applause)

00:04:08.724 --> 00:04:09.987
Thank you very much.

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:13.231
I agree, it looks pretty amazing.

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:15.590
But I have to tell you a funny story.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.104
I got an indoor sunburn doing this

00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:20.152
while shooting in Los Angeles.

00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:22.427
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:24.153
just on any of the beaches,

00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:26.223
but I got mine indoors,

00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:27.932
and what happened is that,

00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:30.753
if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:35.242
you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:37.771
So we had this speaker set up,

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:39.370
and we had the camera facing it,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.756
and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:44.111
and I would set up the speaker,

00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.157
put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:49.978
and we would do this over and over again,

00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:52.739
and it was until midday that I realized

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:55.076
that I had a completely red face

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:58.162
because of the lights pointing at the speaker.

00:04:58.162 --> 00:05:00.468
What was so funny about it was that

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:03.195
the speaker was only coming from the right side,

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:06.562
so the right side of my face was completely red

00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:08.404
and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera

00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:11.246
for the rest of the week.

00:05:11.246 --> 00:05:13.349
Let me now turn to another project

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.869
which involves less harmful substances.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:23.492
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?

00:05:23.492 --> 00:05:26.014
Ah, some of you have. Excellent.

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.891
Should I skip that part?

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.473
(Laughter)

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:32.736
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.988
It's a liquid that is completely black.

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:37.482
It's got an oily consistency.

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:40.942
And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:43.081
which makes it magnetic.

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:46.634
So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:49.427
it would change its appearance.

00:05:49.427 --> 00:05:53.222
Now I've got a live demonstration over here

00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:55.798
to show this to you.

00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:02.486
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,

00:06:02.486 --> 00:06:06.014
and underneath that plate, there is a magnet.

00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:09.006
Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:12.310
to that magnet.

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:21.738
Let's just slightly move it to the right

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.088
and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent.

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:32.281
So what you can see now is that

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:34.678
the ferrofluid has formed spikes.

00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:38.031
This is due to the attraction and the repulsion

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:41.740
of the individual particles inside the liquid.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.983
Now this looks already quite interesting,

00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:47.537
but let me now add some watercolors to it.

00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:49.991
Those are just standard watercolors

00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:51.622
that you would paint with.

00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:52.965
You wouldn't paint with syringes,

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:57.953
but it works just the same.

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:12.910
So what happened now is,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.154
when the watercolor was flowing into the structure,

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:19.505
the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.841
That's because the ferrofluid itself

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.024
is hydrophobic.

00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:26.187
That means it doesn't mix with the water.

00:07:26.187 --> 00:07:29.196
And at the same time, it tries to maintain its position

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:30.561
above the magnet,

00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:33.956
and therefore, it creates those amazing-looking

00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:37.289
structures of channels and tiny little ponds

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.869
of colorful water paint.

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:41.620
So that was the second project.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.972
Let me now turn to the last project,

00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:48.744
which involves

00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:50.834
the national beverage of Scotland.

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:53.154
(Laughter)

00:07:53.154 --> 00:07:57.074
This image, and also this one,

00:07:57.074 --> 00:08:00.345
were made using whiskey.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:01.835
Now you might ask yourself,

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:02.863
how did he do that?

00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:04.712
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey

00:08:04.712 --> 00:08:07.423
and then draw the hallucination he got

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:11.037
from being drunk onto paper?

00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:13.281
I can assure you I was fully conscious

00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.391
while I was taking those pictures.

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:20.493
Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,

00:08:20.493 --> 00:08:24.729
and alcohol has got some very interesting properties.

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:26.420
Maybe you have experienced

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.546
some of those properties before,

00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:31.265
but I am talking about the physical properties,

00:08:31.265 --> 00:08:33.500
not the other ones.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.700
So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.043
would spread in the air,

00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:43.123
and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:47.810
And at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.959
And it was with those two properties

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:52.564
that I was able to create the images

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:54.594
that you're seeing right now.

00:08:54.594 --> 00:08:58.065
Let me demonstrate this over here.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:08.027
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.

00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:09.336
It's got nothing in it.

00:09:09.336 --> 00:09:13.144
And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen

00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:15.825
and whiskey.

00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:34.915
Add some more.

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:40.186
Now we just wait for a few seconds

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:43.233
for the molecules to spread inside the bottle.

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:45.630
And now, let's set that on fire.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.340
(Laughter)

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.278
So that's all that happens.

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:08.477
It goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.

00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:11.083
I could do it again to show it one more time,

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.814
but some would argue that this is a complete waste

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:17.666
of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:19.754
But let me show you a slow motion

00:10:19.754 --> 00:10:21.449
in a completely darkened room

00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:26.699
of what I just showed you in this live demonstration.

00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:36.338
So what happened is that the flame

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:40.330
traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.379
burning the mix of the air molecules

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:45.208
and the alcohol.

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:48.024
So the images that you saw at the beginning,

00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:52.368
they are actually a flame stopped in time

00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:54.846
while it is traveling through the bottle,

00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:56.064
and you have to imagine

00:10:56.064 --> 00:10:59.530
it was flipped around 180 degrees.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.968
So that's how those images were made.

00:11:01.968 --> 00:11:06.324
(Applause)

00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:09.097
Thank you.

00:11:09.097 --> 00:11:12.180
So, I have now showed you three projects,

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.832
and you might ask yourself, what is it good for?

00:11:14.832 --> 00:11:16.423
What's the idea behind it?

00:11:16.423 --> 00:11:17.756
Is it just a waste of whiskey?

00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:21.981
Is it just some strange materials?

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.794
Those three projects, they're based on very simple

00:11:24.794 --> 00:11:26.456
scientific phenomena,

00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:29.197
such as magnetism, the sound waves,

00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:33.239
or over here, the physical properties of a substance,

00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:35.151
and what I'm trying to do

00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:38.300
is I'm trying to use these phenomena

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.417
and show them in a poetic and unseen way,

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:43.836
and therefore invite the viewer

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.736
to pause for a moment

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:48.451
and think about all the beauty

00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:52.394
that is constantly surrounding us.

00:11:52.394 --> 00:11:53.823
Thank you very much.

00:11:53.823 --> 00:11:58.316
(Applause)
