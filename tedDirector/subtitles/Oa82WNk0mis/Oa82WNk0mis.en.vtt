00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
What looks like moss covering rocks

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
is actually a shrub

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
comprised of thousands of branches,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and so densely packed together

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that you could actually stand on top of it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and it happens to be 3,000 years old.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
For the past five years, I've been researching,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
working with biologists

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and traveling all over the world

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to find continuously living organisms

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that are 2,000 years old and older.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
The project is part art and part science.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
There's an environmental component.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And I'm also trying to create a means

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and to start to consider a deeper timescale.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and work backward from there.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
living on the remote island of Yakushima.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I'd been traveling in Japan

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
without an agenda other than to photograph,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and then I heard about this tree

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that is 2,180 years old

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and knew that I had to go visit it.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that I got the idea for the project.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So it was the slow churn, if you will.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I think it was my longstanding desire

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
to bring together my interest

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
in art, science and philosophy

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that allowed me to be ready

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
when the proverbial light bulb went on.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So I started researching, and to my surprise,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
this project had never been done before

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in the arts or the sciences.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And -- perhaps naively --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
that deals with this idea

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of global species longevity.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So what you're looking at here

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and this is around 3,000 years old

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and lives in Greenland,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
which is a long way to go for some lichens.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Visiting Greenland was more like

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
traveling back in time

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
than just traveling very far north.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It was very primal and more remote

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
than anything I'd ever experienced before.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
One was when I had been dropped off by boat

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
on a remote fjord,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
were nowhere to be found.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
so I was literally left to my own devices.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
But luckily, it worked out obviously,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
but it was a humbling experience

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
to feel so disconnected.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And then a few days later,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
near our campsite,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
where the fish were so abundant

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that you could literally reach into the stream

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
It was like visiting

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
a more innocent time on the planet.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And then, of course, there's the lichens.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
These lichens grow only one centimeter

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
every hundred years.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I think that really puts human lifespans

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
into a different perspective.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And what you're looking at here

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
sounds ominous, it is.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
killing certain species of trees in the forest.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
It's also more benignly known

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
because it happens to be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
one of the world's largest organisms as well.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I got some maps and some GPS coordinates

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and chartered a plane

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and started looking for the death rings,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the circular patterns

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in which the fungus kills the trees.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
but I do know the fungus is down there.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And then this back down on the ground

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
So that white material that you see

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
in between the bark and the wood

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is the mycelial felt of the fungus,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and what it's doing -- it's actually

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
slowly strangling the tree to death

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So this strategy has served it pretty well --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
it's 2,400 years old.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And then from underground to underwater.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
that's around 2,000 years old.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
This is at about 60 feet

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
or 18 meters, depth.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that had started eating it,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
of the recent oil spill.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
one of the oldest living things on the planet,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and the full impact of that disaster

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
is still yet to be seen.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Now this is something that I think

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
This is clonal colony

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that is literally 80,000 years old.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
What looks like a forest

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
is actually only one tree.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Imagine that it's one giant root system

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and each tree is a stem

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
coming up from that system.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So what you have is one giant,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
interconnected,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
genetically identical individual

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that's been living for 80,000 years.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It also happens to be male

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and, in theory immortal.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
(Laughter)

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This is a clonal tree as well.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
This is the spruce Gran Picea,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
which at 9,550 years

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
is a mere babe in the woods.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
The location of this tree

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
is actually kept secret for its own protection.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
is most likely a product of climate change.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
the vegetation zone is actually changing.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So we don't even necessarily have to have

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
direct contact with these organisms

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
to have a very real impact on them.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
This is the Fortingall Yew --

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
no, I'm just kidding --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
this is the Fortingall Yew.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
(Laughter)

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
But I put that slide in there

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And aside from coral,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
the answer is no.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
any guesses?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
(Audience: 300.)

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
is the oldest living tortoise,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
so nowhere near 2,000.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And then, you might have heard

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
of this giant clam that was discovered

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
off the coast of northern Iceland

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that reached 405 years old.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
However, it died in the lab

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
as they were determining its age.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
The most interesting discovery of late, I think

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
is the so-called immortal jellyfish,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
which has actually been observed in the lab

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
after reaching full maturity.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So that being said,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And back to the yew here.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard;

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And there are actually a number or ancient yews

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
in churchyards around the U.K.,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
but if you do the math, you'll remember

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And now down to another part of the world.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
with an expert in Baobab trees.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And we saw a number of them,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and this is most likely the oldest.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
It's around 2,000,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and it's called the Sagole Baobab.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And you know, I think of all of these organisms

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
as palimpsests.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
They contain thousands of years

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
of their own histories within themselves,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and they also contain records of natural and human events.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And the Baobabs in particular

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
are a great example of this.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
You can see that this one

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
has names carved into its trunk,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
but it also records some natural events.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
So the Baobabs, as they get older,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And this can create

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
great natural shelters for animals,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
but they've also been appropriated

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
for some rather dubious human uses,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
including a bar, a prison

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and even a toilet inside of a tree.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And this brings me to another favorite of mine --

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
I think, because it is just so unusual.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
This plant is called the Welwitschia,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
where it's uniquely adapted

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And what's more, it's actually a tree.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
It's a primitive conifer.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is actually two single leaves

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that get shredded up

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
by the harsh desert conditions over time.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And it actually never sheds those leaves,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
so it also bears the distinction

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
of having the longest leaves

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
in the plant kingdom.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
I spoke to a biologist

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
to ask him

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
where he thought this remarkable plant came from,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and his thought was that

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
if you travel around Namibia,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
you see that there are a number of petrified forests,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and the logs are all --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
the logs are all giant coniferous trees,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
So his thought was that

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
flooding in the north of Africa

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
actually brought those coniferous trees down

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
tens of thousands of years ago,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
to this unique desert environment.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
This is something called an underground forest.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
who explained that certain species of trees

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
have adapted to this region.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
It's bushfelt region,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
as so what these trees have done

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and that this is ground level,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
imagine that the whole thing,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that whole bulk of the tree,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
migrated underground,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
That way, when a fire roars through,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
The tree can easily recover.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
These also tend to grow clonally,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This is the clonal Creosote bush,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
which is around 12,000 years old.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
If you've been in the American West,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
but that being said, you see that this has

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
this unique, circular form.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
from that original shape.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
making it one genetically identical individual.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It also has a friend nearby --

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
well, I think they're friends.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And you see it has that similar circular form.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And there's some younger clones

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
dotting the landscape behind it.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
live on Bureau of Land Management land,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and that's very different from being protected in a national park.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
In fact, this land is designated

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So, now I want to show what very well might be

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
the oldest living thing on the planet.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
This is Siberian Actinobacteria,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
which is between 400,000

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and 600,000 years old.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
This bacteria was discovered several years ago

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
by a team of planetary biologists

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
hoping to find clues to life on other planets

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
was this bacteria.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
But what's unique about it is that

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
it's doing DNA repair below freezing.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And what that means is that it's not dormant --

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
it's actually been living and growing

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
for half a million years.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It's also probably one the most vulnerable

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
of the oldest living things,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
because if the permafrost melts,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
it won't survive.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
I'm trying to travel there

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
to find 5,000 year-old moss,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
So, I probably have about two more years left

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
on this project --

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
on this phase of the project,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
but after five years,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
The oldest living things in the world

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
are a record and celebration of our past,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
a call to action in the present

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and a barometer of our future.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
They've survived for millennia

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
in desert, in the permafrost,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
They've withstood

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
untold natural perils and human encroachments,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
but now some of them are in jeopardy,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and they can't just get up and get out of the way.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that I can help draw attention

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
to their remarkable resilience

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and help play a part in insuring

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Thank you.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260
(Applause)
