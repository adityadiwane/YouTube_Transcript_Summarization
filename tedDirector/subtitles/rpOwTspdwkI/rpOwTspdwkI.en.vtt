00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.149
The world is changing

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.861
in some really profound ways,

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.844
and I worry that investors

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:20.578
aren't paying enough attention

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:22.443
to some of the biggest drivers of change,

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:26.219
especially when it comes to sustainability.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.674
And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:31.577
like environmental and social issues

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:34.086
and corporate governance.

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:36.352
I think it's reckless to ignore these things,

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:37.998
because doing so can jeopardize

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.467
future long-term returns.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.663
And here's something that may surprise you:

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:47.334
the balance of power to really influence sustainability

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.489
rests with institutional investors,

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.525
the large investors like pension funds,

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:55.481
foundations and endowments.

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.075
I believe that sustainable investing

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.725
is less complicated than you think,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.753
better-performing than you believe,

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:04.626
and more important than we can imagine.

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:07.634
Let me remind you what we already know.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.180
We have a population that's both growing and aging;

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.026
we have seven billion souls today

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.452
heading to 10 billion

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:16.353
at the end of the century;

00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:18.851
we consume natural resources

00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.677
faster than they can be replenished;

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.114
and the emissions that are mainly responsible

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:28.943
for climate change just keep increasing.

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:33.160
Now clearly, these are
environmental and social issues,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.092
but that's not all.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.064
They're economic issues,

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:38.800
and that makes them relevant

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.077
to risk and return.

00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:44.157
And they are really complex

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:45.822
and they can seem really far off,

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:49.108
that the temptation may be to do this:

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.474
bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:55.124
Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.

00:01:55.124 --> 00:01:57.050
(Laughter)

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.693
But it makes me wonder

00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:00.706
if the investment rules of today

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:03.951
are fit for purpose tomorrow.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.789
We know that investors,

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.649
when they look at a company
and decide whether to invest,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.281
they look at financial data,

00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:14.301
metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:19.713
valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:22.040
And these things are fundamental, of course,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.805
but they're not enough.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:26.254
Investors should also look at performance metrics

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:28.178
in what we call ESG:

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:31.020
environment, social and governance.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.782
Environment includes energy consumption,

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:41.166
water availability, waste and pollution,

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.985
just making efficient uses of resources.

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:47.112
Social includes human capital,

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:48.980
things like employee engagement

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.324
and innovation capacity,

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:54.636
as well as supply chain management

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:58.206
and labor rights and human rights.

00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:00.014
And governance relates to the oversight

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.795
of companies by their boards and investors.

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:06.906
See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:11.093
But ESG is the measure of sustainability,

00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:15.234
and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:19.351
with financial factors into the investment process.

00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.479
It means limiting future risk

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.088
by minimizing harm to people and planet,

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.703
and it means providing capital to users

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:30.863
who deploy it towards productive

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:33.587
and sustainable outcomes.

00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:36.751
So if sustainability matters financially today,

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.243
and all signs indicate more tomorrow,

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.741
is the private sector paying attention?

00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:48.722
Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:50.288
They started to see sustainability

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:54.532
not just as important but crucial to business success.

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:56.946
About 80 percent of global CEOs

00:03:56.946 --> 00:04:01.037
see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation

00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:03.430
and leading to competitive advantage

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.154
in their industries.

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:08.327
But 93 percent see ESG as the future,

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:11.376
or as important to the future of their business.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.593
So the views of CEOs are clear.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:17.780
There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.308
So how are companies actually leveraging ESG

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:24.110
to drive hard business results?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.631
One example is near and dear to our hearts.

00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:30.065
In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:31.711
to the cloud environment,

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:34.140
and we retired another 85.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.846
We virtualized our operating system environments,

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:40.309
and we completed numerous automation projects.

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.841
Now these initiatives create
a more mobile workplace,

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:45.625
and they reduce our real estate footprint,

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.265
and they yield savings of 23 million dollars

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:51.265
in operating costs annually,

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.101
and avoid the emissions

00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:57.551
of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.

00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.584
That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:02.373
off the road.

00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:05.012
So awesome, right?

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:07.976
Another example is Pentair.

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:10.305
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,

00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:11.885
and about a decade ago,

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:14.372
they sold their core power tools business

00:05:14.372 --> 00:05:18.630
and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.593
That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:25.321
Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,

00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:28.243
there's more growth in water than in power tools,

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:30.165
and this company has their sights set

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:32.532
on what they call "the new New World."

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.915
That's four billion middle class people

00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:40.069
demanding food, energy and water.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.193
Now, you may be asking yourself,

00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:44.859
are these just isolated cases?

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:46.837
I mean, come on, really?

00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:48.846
Do companies that take sustainability into account

00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:51.032
really do well financially?

00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:53.878
The answer that may surprise you is yes.

00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:57.043
The data shows that stocks
with better ESG performance

00:05:57.043 --> 00:06:00.390
perform just as well as others.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.664
In blue, we see the MSCI World.

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:04.101
It's an index of large companies

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.890
from developed markets across the world.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.362
And in gold, we see a subset of companies

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:12.145
rated as having the best ESG performance.

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:16.396
Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.

00:06:16.396 --> 00:06:20.807
So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.

00:06:20.807 --> 00:06:23.370
In some cases, there may be outperformance

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.953
from ESG.

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:28.131
In blue, we see the performance

00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.546
of the 500 largest global companies,

00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:33.859
and in gold, we see a subset of companies

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:36.682
with best practice in climate change strategy

00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:38.115
and risk management.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.545
Now over almost eight years,

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:42.555
they've outperformed by about two thirds.

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:46.449
So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.978
But it does illustrate that environmental leadership

00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:52.051
is compatible with good returns.

00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:56.394
So if the returns are the same or better

00:06:56.394 --> 00:06:59.505
and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:02.636
Are investors, particularly institutional investors,

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.075
engaged?

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.952
Well, some are,

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:09.288
and a few are really at the vanguard.

00:07:09.288 --> 00:07:10.527
Hesta.

00:07:10.527 --> 00:07:12.774
Hesta is a retirement fund for health

00:07:12.774 --> 00:07:15.469
and community services employees in Australia,

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.714
with assets of 22 billion [dollars].

00:07:17.714 --> 00:07:19.537
They believe that ESG has the potential

00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:21.605
to impact risks and returns,

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:24.897
so incorporating it into the investment process

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:27.113
is core to their duty

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.271
to act in the best interest of fund members,

00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:30.957
core to their duty.

00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:34.668
You gotta love the Aussies, right?

00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:37.176
CalPERS is another example.

00:07:37.176 --> 00:07:39.197
CalPERS is the pension fund

00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:41.478
for public employees in California,

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:44.194
and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:46.286
they are the second largest in the U.S.

00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:48.983
and the sixth largest in the world.

00:07:48.983 --> 00:07:50.546
Now, they're moving toward 100 percent

00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:52.135
sustainable investment

00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:54.217
by systematically integrated ESG

00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:56.966
across the entire fund.

00:07:56.966 --> 00:08:00.423
Why? They believe it's critical

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:04.954
to superior long-term returns, full stop.

00:08:04.954 --> 00:08:07.546
In their own words, "long-term value creation

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:09.586
requires the effective management

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.728
of three forms of capital:

00:08:11.728 --> 00:08:16.447
financial, human, and physical.

00:08:16.447 --> 00:08:20.306
This is why we are concerned with ESG."

00:08:20.306 --> 00:08:22.714
Now, I do speak to a lot of investors

00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:24.441
as part of my job,

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.735
and not all of them see it this way.

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.493
Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,

00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:32.243
so we don't do that here,"

00:08:32.243 --> 00:08:34.590
or, "We don't want to use the portfolio

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.094
to make policy statements."

00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:39.960
The one that just really gets under my skin is,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.012
"If you want to do something about that,

00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:45.475
just make money, give the profits to charities."

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:49.244
It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.

00:08:49.244 --> 00:08:53.267
I mean, let me clarify something right here.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.872
Companies and investors are not

00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:58.631
singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.

00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:01.019
They don't have indefinite social obligations,

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.792
and prudent investing and finance theory

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:05.891
aren't subordinate to sustainability.

00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:07.547
They're compatible.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:12.012
So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.

00:09:12.012 --> 00:09:13.989
But institutional investors

00:09:13.989 --> 00:09:17.155
are the x-factor in sustainability.

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:19.218
Why do they hold the key?

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:22.933
The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.

00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:25.619
(Laughter)

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.015
A lot of it.

00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:29.757
I mean, a really lot of it.

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:32.600
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.658
The global bond market, 78 trillion.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:40.836
That's 133 trillion combined.

00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:43.507
That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.

00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:45.726
That's the world's largest economy.

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:49.563
That's some serious freaking firepower.

00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:51.612
So we can reconsider

00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:53.535
some of these pressing challenges,

00:09:53.535 --> 00:09:56.049
like fresh water, clean air,

00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:58.074
feeding 10 billion mouths,

00:09:58.074 --> 00:09:59.751
if institutional investors

00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.163
integrated ESG into investment.

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:04.314
What if they used that firepower

00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:06.358
to allocate more of their capital

00:10:06.358 --> 00:10:07.771
to companies working the hardest

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:09.853
at solving these challenges

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:12.969
or at least not exacerbating them?

00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:17.806
What if we work and save and invest,

00:10:17.806 --> 00:10:20.439
only to find that the world we retire into

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:24.165
is more stressed and less secure than it is now?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:29.037
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?

00:10:29.037 --> 00:10:31.525
Now a fair question might be,

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:33.421
what if all this sustainability risk stuff

00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.957
is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,

00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:40.110
something for virtuous consumers

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.066
or lifestyle choice?

00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:44.805
Well, President John F. Kennedy said something

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:48.290
about this that is just spot on:

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.102
"There are risks and costs to a program of action,

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:54.751
but they are far less than the long-range risks

00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:59.366
and costs of comfortable inaction."

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:02.984
I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:06.619
but since this is based on
widespread scientific consensus,

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:09.180
the odds that it's not completely wrong

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.796
are better than the odds

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:12.471
that our house will burn down

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.406
or we'll get in a car accident.

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:18.000
Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.303
But my point is that we buy insurance

00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:23.286
to protect ourselves financially

00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:26.489
in case those things happen, right?

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:28.038
So by investing sustainably

00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:30.257
we're doing two things.

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:32.415
We're creating insurance,

00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:36.661
reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,

00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:38.650
and at the same time, in the short term,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.326
we're not sacrificing performance.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:46.083
[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax 
and we create a better world for nothing?"]

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:48.199
Good, you like it. I like it too.

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:49.776
(Laughter)

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.849
I like it because it pokes fun

00:11:51.849 --> 00:11:54.444
at both sides of the climate change issue.

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:57.788
I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.

00:11:57.788 --> 00:11:59.527
But what I really like about it

00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:02.456
is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:04.525
which is, "Plan for the future,

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:06.095
because that's where you're going to spend

00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:08.596
the rest of your life."

00:12:08.596 --> 00:12:10.955
Thank you.

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:14.100
(Applause)
