00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.286
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
that's in this book of mine

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.407
that I hope will resonate with other
things you've already heard,

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.732
and I'll try to make
some connections myself,

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:35.076
in case you missed them.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.293
But I want to start with
what I call the "official dogma."

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.388
The official dogma of what?

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:44.718
The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.

00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:47.055
And the official dogma runs like this:

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.777
if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:56.741
the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.

00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:01.976
The reason for this is both that freedom
is in and of itself good,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.122
valuable, worthwhile,
essential to being human.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.976
And because if people have freedom,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.976
then each of us can act on our own

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.286
to do the things
that will maximize our welfare,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.610
and no one has to decide on our behalf.

00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:19.737
The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice.

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:24.428
The more choice people have,
the more freedom they have,

00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:26.135
and the more freedom they have,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.786
the more welfare they have.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.976
This, I think, is so deeply embedded
in the water supply

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.240
that it wouldn't occur
to anyone to question it.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:41.976
And it's also deeply
embedded in our lives.

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:44.312
I'll give you some examples

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.976
of what modern progress
has made possible for us.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.353
This is my supermarket.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.097
Not such a big one.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.239
I want to say just a word
about salad dressing.

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.976
175 salad dressings in my supermarket,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
if you don't count the 10
extra-virgin olive oils

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.976
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.976
to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.753
in the off-chance that none of the 175
the store has on offer suit you.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.413
So this is what the supermarket is like.

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:15.865
And then you go
to the consumer electronics store

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.484
to set up a stereo system --

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:20.976
speakers, CD player,
tape player, tuner, amplifier --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.976
and in this one single
consumer electronics store,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.279
there are that many stereo systems.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.897
We can construct six-and-a-half-million
different stereo systems

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.579
out of the components
that are on offer in one store.

00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:38.617
You've got to admit
that's a lot of choice.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:42.976
In other domains --
the world of communications.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.231
There was a time, when I was a boy,

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:48.072
when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted,

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:49.914
as long as it came from Ma Bell.

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:51.976
You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.191
One consequence of that, by the way,
is that the phone never broke.

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:57.976
And those days are gone.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.976
We now have an almost
unlimited variety of phones,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.976
especially in the world of cell phones.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.238
These are cell phones of the future.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.976
My favorite is the middle one --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.185
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
and crème brûlée torch.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.696
(Laughter)

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.976
And if by some chance you haven't
seen that in your store yet,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.886
you can rest assured
that one day soon, you will.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.087
And what this does

00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:25.270
is it leads people to walk
into their stores asking this question.

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:28.453
And do you know what the answer
to this question now is?

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:29.992
The answer is "no."

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.976
It is not possible to buy a cell phone
that doesn't do too much.

00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:38.976
So, in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.493
the same explosion of choice is true.

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:44.023
Health care.

00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:46.580
It is no longer the case
in the United States

00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:50.099
that you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you what to do.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.139
Instead, you go to the doctor,

00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:55.313
and the doctor tells you,
"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:57.719
A has these benefits, and these risks.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:03:59.948
B has these benefits, and these risks.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:01.701
What do you want to do?"

00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:04.352
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.756
And the doc says, "A has
these benefits and risks,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.738
and B has these benefits and risks.

00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:11.301
What do you want to do?"

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:15.110
And you say, "If you were me,
Doc, what would you do?"

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:17.834
And the doc says, "But I'm not you."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.818
And the result is --
we call it "patient autonomy,"

00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:23.715
which makes it sound like a good thing,

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:26.802
but it really is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:29.475
for decision-making from somebody
who knows something --

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.513
namely, the doctor --

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:33.269
to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:35.976
and thus not in the best shape
to be making decisions --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.872
namely, the patient.

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:40.722
There's enormous marketing
of prescription drugs

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:41.997
to people like you and me,

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:44.477
which, if you think about it,
makes no sense at all,

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.714
since we can't buy them.

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:48.191
Why do they market to us
if we can't buy them?

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:51.976
The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.249
and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed.

00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:59.509
Something as dramatic as our identity

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.293
has now become a matter of choice,

00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:05.770
as this slide is meant to indicate.

00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:08.622
We don't inherit an identity;
we get to invent it.

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:11.976
And we get to re-invent
ourselves as often as we like.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.953
And that means that every day,
when you wake up in the morning,

00:05:14.977 --> 00:05:17.912
you have to decide what kind
of person you want to be.

00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:22.420
With respect to marriage and family,

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:27.265
there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.391
is that you got married
as soon as you could,

00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:32.025
and then you started having kids
as soon as you could.

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:34.904
The only real choice was who,

00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:37.541
not when, and not what you did after.

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:40.976
Nowadays, everything
is very much up for grabs.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.721
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,

00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.519
and I assign 20 percent
less work than I used to.

00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:49.976
And it's not because they're less smart,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.393
and it's not because
they're less diligent.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:55.870
It's because they are preoccupied,
asking themselves,

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.506
"Should I get married or not?
Should I get married now?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.823
Should I get married later?

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:02.234
Should I have kids first,
or a career first?"

00:06:02.258 --> 00:06:04.976
All of these are consuming questions.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.096
And they're going to answer
these questions,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.741
whether or not it means
not doing all the work I assign

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:11.819
and not getting a good grade
in my courses.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:12.977
And indeed they should.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.335
These are important questions to answer.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.050
Work --

00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:20.369
we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.370
with the technology that enables us

00:06:22.394 --> 00:06:28.436
to work every minute of every day
from any place on the planet --

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.238
except the Randolph Hotel.

00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:33.817
(Laughter)

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:35.610
(Applause)

00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:37.976
There is one corner, by the way,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.606
that I'm not going to tell anybody about,
where the WiFi actually works.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.415
I'm not telling you about it
because I want to use it.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.684
So what this means,

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.747
this incredible freedom of choice
we have with respect to work,

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:51.444
is that we have to make a decision,

00:06:51.468 --> 00:06:53.556
again and again and again,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.976
about whether we should
or shouldn't be working.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.605
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.606
and we have our cell phone on one hip,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.677
and our Blackberry on our other hip,

00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:05.411
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:07.547
And even if they're all shut off,

00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:10.642
every minute that we're watching
our kid mutilate a soccer game,

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:12.448
we are also asking ourselves,

00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:14.498
"Should I answer this cell phone call?

00:07:14.522 --> 00:07:17.395
Should I respond to this email?
Should I draft this letter?"

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.976
And even if the answer
to the question is "no,"

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.286
it's certainly going to make
the experience of your kid's soccer game

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.224
very different than it would've been.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.707
So everywhere we look,

00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:31.489
big things and small things,
material things and lifestyle things,

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.681
life is a matter of choice.

00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:37.976
And the world we used
to live in looked like this.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.211
[Well, actually,
they are written in stone.]

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.177
That is to say, there were some choices,

00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.202
but not everything was a matter of choice.

00:07:44.226 --> 00:07:46.361
And the world we now live in
looks like this.

00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:47.961
[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:51.716
And the question is,
is this good news, or bad news?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.199
And the answer is, "yes."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.611
(Laughter)

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.463
We all know what's good about it,

00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:02.976
so I'm going to talk
about what's bad about it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.447
All of this choice has two effects,

00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.420
two negative effects on people.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.612
One effect, paradoxically,

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:15.093
is that it produces paralysis,
rather than liberation.

00:08:15.698 --> 00:08:17.976
With so many options to choose from,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.568
people find it very difficult
to choose at all.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.976
I'll give you one very
dramatic example of this:

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.556
a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans.

00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:36.431
A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard,

00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:38.076
the gigantic mutual-fund company

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.976
of about a million employees
and about 2,000 different workplaces.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.368
And what she found

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:47.660
is that for every 10 mutual funds
the employer offered,

00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:51.366
rate of participation
went down two percent.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.498
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent
fewer employees participate

00:08:56.522 --> 00:08:58.179
than if you only offer five.

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:00.173
Why?

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:02.181
Because with 50 funds to choose from,

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:05.976
it's so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.048
that you'll just put it off
until tomorrow.

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:09.271
And then tomorrow,

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:11.272
and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:13.301
and of course tomorrow never comes.

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:15.454
Understand that not only does this mean

00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:18.428
that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire

00:09:18.452 --> 00:09:20.634
because they don't have
enough money put away,

00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:23.245
it also means that making
the decision is so hard

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:26.976
that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.976
By not participating, they are passing up
as much as 5,000 dollars a year

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.297
from the employer,

00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:34.420
who would happily
match their contribution.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.680
So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices.

00:09:38.704 --> 00:09:41.190
And I think it makes
the world look like this.

00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:46.206
[And lastly, for all eternity,
French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.976
(Laughter)

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.874
You really want to get the decision
right if it's for all eternity, right?

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:55.440
You don't want to pick the wrong
mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.

00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:56.616
So that's one effect.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.774
The second effect

00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:03.356
is that even if we manage to overcome
the paralysis and make a choice,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.293
we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice

00:10:07.317 --> 00:10:09.976
than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:12.647
And there are several reasons for this.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:14.369
One of them

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:17.350
is that with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from,

00:10:17.374 --> 00:10:20.717
if you buy one, and it's not perfect --
and what salad dressing is? --

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:23.560
it's easy to imagine
you could have made a different choice

00:10:23.584 --> 00:10:24.961
that would have been better.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.976
And what happens

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.802
is this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made,

00:10:31.826 --> 00:10:34.404
and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction

00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:36.206
you get out of the decision you made,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.808
even if it was a good decision.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.334
The more options there are,
the easier it is to regret anything at all

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:44.882
that is disappointing
about the option that you chose.

00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:47.976
Second, what economists
call "opportunity costs."

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.976
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.976
of talking about how much the way
in which we value things

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.976
depends on what we compare them to.

00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.976
Well, when there are lots
of alternatives to consider,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.155
it is easy to imagine
the attractive features

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:06.976
of alternatives that you reject

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.633
that make you less satisfied
with the alternative that you've chosen.

00:11:11.657 --> 00:11:12.740
Here's an example.

00:11:12.764 --> 00:11:16.673
[I can't stop thinking about those other
available parking spaces on W 85th street]

00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:18.237
Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.270
Here's what you're
supposed to be thinking.

00:11:20.294 --> 00:11:22.056
Here's this couple on the Hamptons.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.376
Very expensive real estate.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.376
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.
They have it all to themselves.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.771
What could be better?

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:29.672
"Well, damn it," this guy is thinking,

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:33.670
"It's August. Everybody
in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.528
I could be parking
right in front of my building."

00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:41.412
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea

00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:43.290
that he is missing the opportunity,

00:11:43.314 --> 00:11:46.282
day after day, to have
a great parking space.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.395
Opportunity costs

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:52.489
subtract from the satisfaction
we get out of what we choose,

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.346
even when what we choose is terrific.

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:57.147
And the more options
there are to consider,

00:11:57.171 --> 00:11:59.377
the more attractive
features of these options

00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:02.619
are going to be reflected
by us as opportunity costs.

00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:04.602
Here's another example.

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:08.786
(Laughter)

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:11.309
Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:14.731
It makes points about living
in the moment as well,

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.732
and probably about doing things slowly.

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:17.899
But one point it makes

00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:20.084
is that whenever
you're choosing one thing,

00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:21.976
you're choosing not to do other things

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.064
that may have lots of attractive features,

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:26.835
and it's going to make
what you're doing less attractive.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.301
Third: escalation of expectations.

00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:32.206
This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.976
I wear jeans almost all the time.

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:36.746
There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.841
and you bought them,
and they fit like crap,

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:40.555
they were incredibly uncomfortable,

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:42.976
if you wore them
and washed them enough times,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.560
they started to feel OK.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.125
I went to replace my jeans after years
of wearing these old ones,

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:51.000
and I said, "I want
a pair of jeans. Here's my size."

00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:52.210
And the shopkeeper said,

00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:54.976
"Do you want slim fit,
easy fit, relaxed fit?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.381
You want button fly or zipper fly?
You want stonewashed or acid-washed?

00:12:58.405 --> 00:12:59.770
Do you want them distressed?

00:12:59.794 --> 00:13:02.631
You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah."
On and on he went.

00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:03.804
My jaw dropped.

00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:06.066
And after I recovered, I said,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.090
"I want the kind that used
to be the only kind."

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:13.883
(Laughter)

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.977
He had no idea what that was,

00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:17.158
(Laughter)

00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:19.976
so I spent an hour trying on
all these damn jeans,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.047
and I walked out of the store -- truth! --

00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:24.712
with the best-fitting jeans
I had ever had.

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:25.895
I did better.

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:29.163
All this choice made
it possible for me to do better.

00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:30.854
But --

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:32.298
I felt worse.

00:13:33.544 --> 00:13:36.976
Why? I wrote a whole book
to try to explain this to myself.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.342
The reason --

00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:42.599
(Laughter)

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:44.976
The reason I felt worse is that,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.714
with all of these options available,

00:13:47.738 --> 00:13:52.919
my expectations about how good
a pair of jeans should be went up.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.214
I had very low, no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:01.878
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
one of them should've been perfect.

00:14:01.902 --> 00:14:04.239
And what I got was good,
but it wasn't perfect.

00:14:04.263 --> 00:14:07.349
And so I compared what I got
to what I expected,

00:14:07.373 --> 00:14:10.603
and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected.

00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:13.238
Adding options to people's lives

00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:16.866
can't help but increase
the expectations people have

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.976
about how good those options will be.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.191
And what that's going to produce
is less satisfaction with results,

00:14:22.215 --> 00:14:23.968
even when they're good results.

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:27.242
Nobody in the world
of marketing knows this.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.035
[It all looks so great.
I can't wait to be disappointed.]

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:33.544
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know
what this was about.

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.863
The truth is more like this.

00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.590
[Everything was better back
when everything was worse]

00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:43.626
The reason that everything was better
back when everything was worse

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.792
is that when everything was worse,

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:47.587
it was actually possible for people

00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:50.006
to have experiences
that were a pleasant surprise.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.285
Nowadays, the world we live in --
we affluent, industrialized citizens,

00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:57.136
with perfection the expectation --

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.041
the best you can ever hope for

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.730
is that stuff is as good
as you expect it to be.

00:15:01.754 --> 00:15:03.596
You will never be pleasantly surprised

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.666
because your expectations,
my expectations,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.039
have gone through the roof.

00:15:07.063 --> 00:15:10.484
The secret to happiness --
this is what you all came for --

00:15:10.508 --> 00:15:13.057
the secret to happiness

00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:15.049
is low expectations.

00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:18.317
(Laughter)

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:19.826
[You'll do]

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.008
(Applause)

00:15:21.032 --> 00:15:24.341
(Laughter)

00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:25.617
I want to say --

00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.284
just a little autobiographical moment --

00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:31.298
that I actually am married to a wife,

00:15:31.322 --> 00:15:32.976
and she's really quite wonderful.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.574
I couldn't have done better.

00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:36.158
I didn't settle.

00:15:36.182 --> 00:15:38.595
But settling isn't
always such a bad thing.

00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.166
Finally --

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.397
One consequence of buying
a bad-fitting pair of jeans

00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:46.469
when there is only one kind to buy

00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:48.976
is that when you are dissatisfied,
and you ask why,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.237
who's responsible,

00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:52.769
the answer is clear:
the world is responsible.

00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:54.386
What could you do?

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.378
When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available,

00:15:57.402 --> 00:15:59.774
and you buy one that is disappointing,

00:15:59.798 --> 00:16:01.976
and you ask why, who's responsible?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.319
It is equally clear that the answer
to the question is "you."

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.976
You could have done better.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.976
With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.976
there is no excuse for failure.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.384
And so when people make decisions,

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.976
and even though the results
of the decisions are good,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.726
they feel disappointed about them;

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.727
they blame themselves.

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:25.702
Clinical depression has exploded

00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.217
in the industrial world
in the last generation.

00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:31.976
I believe a significant -- not the only,
but a significant -- contributor

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.273
to this explosion of depression,
and also suicide,

00:16:35.297 --> 00:16:37.976
is that people have experiences
that are disappointing

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.858
because their standards are so high,

00:16:39.882 --> 00:16:43.074
and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves,

00:16:43.098 --> 00:16:44.440
they think they're at fault.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.976
And so the net result is that we do
better in general, objectively,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.010
and we feel worse.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.554
So let me remind you.

00:16:54.578 --> 00:16:58.976
This is the official dogma,
the one that we all take to be true,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.114
and it's all false.

00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:02.708
It is not true.

00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:07.491
There's no question that some choice
is better than none,

00:17:07.515 --> 00:17:09.614
but it doesn't follow from that

00:17:09.638 --> 00:17:11.976
that more choice
is better than some choice.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.877
There's some magical amount.
I don't know what it is.

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:17.794
I'm pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:19.904
where options improve our welfare.

00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:23.308
Now, as a policy matter --
I'm almost done --

00:17:23.332 --> 00:17:26.817
as a policy matter,
the thing to think about is this:

00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:29.463
what enables all of this choice

00:17:29.487 --> 00:17:33.558
in industrial societies
is material affluence.

00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:36.287
There are lots of places in the world,

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:38.276
and we have heard about several of them,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.062
where their problem
is not that they have too much choice.

00:17:41.086 --> 00:17:43.184
Their problem
is that they have too little.

00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:45.976
So the stuff I'm talking about
is the peculiar problem

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.648
of modern, affluent, Western societies.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.897
And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this:

00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:55.191
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday

00:17:55.215 --> 00:18:01.470
about how these expensive
and difficult-to-install child seats

00:18:01.494 --> 00:18:03.104
don't help.

00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:05.661
It's a waste of money.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:06.970
What I'm telling you

00:18:06.994 --> 00:18:10.195
is that these expensive,
complicated choices --

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:12.383
it's not simply that they don't help.

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:13.976
They actually hurt.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.383
They actually make us worse off.

00:18:16.928 --> 00:18:20.679
If some of what enables
people in our societies

00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:22.702
to make all of the choices we make

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:27.314
were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options,

00:18:27.338 --> 00:18:29.618
not only would those
people's lives be improved,

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:31.976
but ours would be improved also,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.977
which is what economists call
a "Pareto-improving move."

00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:38.713
Income redistribution will make
everyone better off --

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:40.149
not just poor people --

00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:43.080
because of how all this excess
choice plagues us.

00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:44.762
So to conclude.

00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:47.096
[You can be anything
you want to be -- no limits]

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.759
You're supposed to read this cartoon,
and, being a sophisticated person, say,

00:18:50.783 --> 00:18:52.238
"Ah! What does this fish know?

00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:55.359
You know, nothing is possible
in this fishbowl."

00:18:55.753 --> 00:18:58.356
Impoverished imagination,
a myopic view of the world --

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.214
and that's the way I read it at first.

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:02.055
The more I thought about it, however,

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:05.617
the more I came to the view
that this fish knows something.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.976
Because the truth of the matter

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.469
is that if you shatter the fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:19:12.493 --> 00:19:13.906
you don't have freedom.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.524
You have paralysis.

00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:19.469
If you shatter this fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:22.431
you decrease satisfaction.

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:26.756
You increase paralysis,
and you decrease satisfaction.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.445
Everybody needs a fishbowl.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.048
This one is almost
certainly too limited --

00:19:31.072 --> 00:19:34.309
perhaps even for the fish,
certainly for us.

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:38.698
But the absence of some metaphorical
fishbowl is a recipe for misery,

00:19:38.722 --> 00:19:40.507
and, I suspect, disaster.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.270
Thank you very much.

00:19:42.294 --> 00:19:43.936
(Applause)
