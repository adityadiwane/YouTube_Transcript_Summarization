00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.162
This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.795
It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.112
if they're to work at all.

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:25.279
So think, for instance,

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.897
of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.680
or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.527
or a parent with complex child care needs.

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:37.685
Their availability for work can be such that it's,

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.378
"A few hours today.

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:42.978
Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.497
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:48.526
to find the work that they so often need very badly.

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:51.345
Which is a tragedy because there are employers

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.651
who can use pools of very flexible local people

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.550
booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.151
Imagine that you run a cafe.

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.818
It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.401
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.718
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:10.372
to start in an hour's time,

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:15.330
you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.206
They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:20.373
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.

00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:24.305
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.688
so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:30.006
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.305
it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:37.838
There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,

00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:40.989
possibly already once they've been inducted.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.022
At this level of the labor market,

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:46.872
what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.989
They do exist. Here's how they work.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.456
So in this example, a distribution company has said,

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:55.739
we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.139
Show us everyone who's available.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.790
It's found 31 workers.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.322
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.656
They're all contactable in time for this booking.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:08.657
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:12.071
And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:14.632
And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.

00:02:14.632 --> 00:02:16.556
Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.771
You can select as many of them as you want.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.223
They're from multiple agencies.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:24.155
It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:26.489
And it's monitoring their reliability.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.489
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.238
They're likely to be more expensive.

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.439
In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.122
here's a market research company,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:40.072
and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.

00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:42.757
And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.

00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:46.156
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:48.438
are available each hour next week.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:51.172
And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.

00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:53.789
But is there more that could be done

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.539
for this corner of the labor market?

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.225
Because right now there are so many people

00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:01.823
who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:03.873
Let's make it personal.

00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:06.656
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:08.856
very little prospect of getting a job --

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:12.572
what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.856
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:18.156
in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.488
She may be interested in providing local services to her community:

00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:24.039
babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.176
She may have possessions that she would like to trade

00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:28.422
at times she doesn't need them.

00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:32.021
So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.189
She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.590
And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware --

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.155
yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.915
so she can go online and do all this.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.573
She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,

00:03:46.573 --> 00:03:50.457
she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:55.807
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.

00:03:55.807 --> 00:04:02.421
And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:06.972
Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,

00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:10.656
but only for organizations at the top of the economy.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.656
If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:16.572
that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:20.155
that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:23.808
executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:27.240
It analyzes supply and demand and pricing

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.333
and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.883
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:35.317
It's all extremely low overhead.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:38.318
What have we gained at the bottom of the economy

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:42.412
in terms of markets in the last 20 years?

00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:48.571
Basically classified adverts with a search facility.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.584
So why do we have this disparity

00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:54.134
between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy

00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:57.750
that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.199
out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.583
and what the rest of us have?

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:06.649
A modern market is more than a website;

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.268
it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.802
back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,

00:05:11.802 --> 00:05:16.699
settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.850
And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.049
she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:27.665
and then post that listing on multiple websites

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.165
and wait for potential buyers to get in touch

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:33.882
and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:36.781
In the early days of this modern markets technology,

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:38.849
the financial institutions worked out

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.481
how they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:44.781
their relationships, their networks

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:49.371
to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:52.460
They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.094
and in a lot of cases they got it.

00:05:55.094 --> 00:05:57.044
But throughout the economy,

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:59.862
there are facilities that could likewise leverage

00:05:59.862 --> 00:06:01.461
a new generation of markets

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.194
for the benefit of all of us.

00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:06.162
And those facilities --

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:09.878
I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,

00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:12.161
the licensing authorities

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.994
that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:19.662
the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.

00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:22.511
These mechanisms, these facilities

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:26.060
are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.162
they're controlled by the state.

00:06:29.162 --> 00:06:31.893
And the policymakers who sit on top of them

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:38.111
are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used

00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:40.894
to underpin a whole new era of markets.

00:06:40.894 --> 00:06:45.611
Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:47.879
that modern markets are the preserve

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:55.790
of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.217
Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:02.383
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,

00:07:02.383 --> 00:07:04.565
or the leader of any other developed nation,

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:08.416
woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.582
all the jobs I need in the current climate.

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:15.916
I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:19.883
And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.

00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:22.251
How do I make that happen?"

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.000
And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.782
Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.312
Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:35.317
Not necessarily.

00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:38.165
There is a precedent for technology-enabled service

00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:41.867
that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries

00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:44.683
and has been hugely successful:

00:07:44.683 --> 00:07:47.133
national lotteries.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.883
Let's take Britain as an example.

00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:51.483
Our government didn't design the national lottery,

00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:54.266
it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:59.417
It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.

00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:02.682
This act defines what a national lottery will look like.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.350
It specifies certain benefits

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.033
that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:09.732
And it puts some obligations on those operators.

00:08:09.732 --> 00:08:13.082
In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,

00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:16.116
this was an unqualified success.

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:17.900
But let's suppose that our aim

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.783
is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.

00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:23.933
Could we use the same model?

00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:25.717
I believe we could.

00:08:25.717 --> 00:08:29.833
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:33.817
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.

00:08:33.817 --> 00:08:35.666
Think of it as a regulated public utility.

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.550
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.666
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:45.483
that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.232
And government has certain benefits

00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:50.782
it can uniquely bestow on these markets.

00:08:50.782 --> 00:08:53.566
It's about public spending going through these markets

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.165
to buy public services at the local level.

00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:57.900
It's about interfacing these markets

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.550
direct into the highest official channels in the land.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.950
It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.732
It's about deregulating some sectors

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:09.165
so that local people can enter them.

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.417
So, taxi journeys might be one example.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:16.199
And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:17.800
to be placed on the operators,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.300
and the key one is, of course,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.166
that the operators pay for everything,

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:25.167
including all the interfacing into the public sector.

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:28.733
So imagine that the operators make their return

00:09:28.733 --> 00:09:31.916
by building a percentage markup into each transaction.

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:34.350
Imagine that there's a concession period

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.783
defined of maybe 15 years

00:09:36.783 --> 00:09:41.249
in which they can take all these benefits and run with them.

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:44.566
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,

00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:48.199
whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:49.691
to fund the whole thing

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:51.066
will get the deal.

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.866
So government then exits the frame.

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.499
This is now in the hands of the consortium.

00:09:54.499 --> 00:09:57.050
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.134
and make a percentage on all of it

00:09:59.134 --> 00:10:00.733
or it's all going to crash and burn,

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.350
which is tough on their shareholders.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.800
It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.450
And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.883
So this would just be one more choice

00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:14.699
among millions of Internet forums.

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.249
But it could be very different,

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:20.867
because having access to those state-backed facilities

00:10:20.867 --> 00:10:23.200
could incentivize this consortium

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.317
to seriously invest in the service.

00:10:25.317 --> 00:10:28.384
Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going

00:10:28.384 --> 00:10:30.115
to start making their return.

00:10:30.115 --> 00:10:35.006
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care,

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:38.963
the hire of toys, farm work,

00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:42.582
hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,

00:10:42.582 --> 00:10:44.389
services for tourists, home care.

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:51.172
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:55.039
because national e-markets will deliver data.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:57.672
So this is a local person

00:10:57.672 --> 00:11:00.672
potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:03.521
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training

00:11:03.521 --> 00:11:04.921
if they wanted to go into that market.

00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.539
They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:09.039
who wanted a pool of babysitters.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:10.440
Is it worth their while?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.140
Should they be looking at other sectors?

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.024
Should they be moving to another part of the country

00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:16.273
where there's a shortage of babysitters?

00:11:16.273 --> 00:11:18.623
This kind of data can become routine.

00:11:18.623 --> 00:11:20.657
And this data can be used by investors.

00:11:20.657 --> 00:11:23.823
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country

00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:26.722
and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,

00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:28.306
an investor can pay for it

00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:31.990
and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.639
for maybe the next two years.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:36.940
This is a world of atomized capitalism.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.972
So it's small trades by small people,

00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:45.839
but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.764
Some rough research suggests this could unlock

00:11:48.764 --> 00:11:52.965
around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity

00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:54.915
in a country the size of the U.K.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.648
Does that sound improbable to you?

00:11:57.648 --> 00:12:01.781
That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.833
in financial exchanges 20 years ago.

00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:07.933
Do not underestimate the transformative power

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:11.089
of truly modern markets.

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:12.715
Thank you.

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:14.300
(Applause)
