00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:18.577
I am a PhD student.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:21.157
And that means I have a question:

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.868
How can we make digital content graspable?

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.445
Because you see, on the one hand,
there is the digital world

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.445
and no question, many things
are happening there right now.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.355
And for us humans, it's not quite
material, it's not really there --

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.990
it's virtual.

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:38.236
On the other hand,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.346
we're humans, we live in a physical world.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.331
It's rich, it tastes good,
it feels good, it smells good.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.880
So the question is:

00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:47.956
How do we get the stuff over
from the digital into the physical?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.546
That's my question.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.696
If you look at the iPhone with its touch

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.697
and the Wii with its bodily activity,

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.698
you can see the tendency;
it's getting physical.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.635
The question is: What's next?

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.252
Now, I have three options
that I would like to show you.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:04.274
The first one is mass.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.500
As humans, we are sensitive
to where an object in our hand is heavy.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:10.600
So could we use that in mobile phones?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.745
Let me show you
the weight-shifting mobile.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:15.478
It is a mobile phone-shaped box

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:18.617
that has an iron weight inside,
which we can move around,

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.434
and you can feel where it's heavy.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:23.236
We shift the gravitational center of it.

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:28.009
For example, we can augment
digital content with physical mass.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.209
So you move around the content
on the display,

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:33.582
but you can also feel where it is
just from the weight of the device.

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.259
Another thing it's good for is navigation.

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:39.936
It can guide you around in a city.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.627
It can tell you by its weight,

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:44.628
"OK, move right. Walk ahead.
Make a left here."

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:46.269
And the good thing about that is,

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:48.671
you don't have to look
at the device all the time;

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.643
you have your eyes free to see the city.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.203
Now, mass is the first thing --

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:54.287
the second thing, that's shape.

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:58.055
We're also sensitive to the shape
of objects we have in our hands.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.615
So if I download an e-book
and it has 20 pages --

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.186
well, they could be thin, right?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.168
But if it has 500 pages,
I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.354
it's thick.

00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:07.384
(Laughter)

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:10.236
So let me show you
the shape-changing mobile.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.236
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and this one can change its shape.

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:18.592
We can play with the shape itself.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:20.665
For example, it can be thin
in your pocket,

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.332
which we of course want it to be.

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:25.782
But then if you hold it in your hand,
it can lean towards you, be thick.

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:27.783
It's like tapered to the downside.

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:30.281
If you change the grasp,
it can adjust to that.

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:34.518
It's also useful if you want to put it
down on your nightstand

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:36.586
to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.771
It stands.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.236
It's fairly simple.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.951
Another thing is,

00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.072
sometimes we watch things
on a mobile phone

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.084
that are bigger than the phone itself.

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:47.118
In that case -- like here, there's an app

00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:49.055
that's bigger than the phone's screen --

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.954
the shape of the phone could tell you,

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:53.576
"OK, off the screen, right here,
there is more content.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.231
You can't see it, but it's there."

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:58.053
And you can feel it,
because it's thicker at that edge.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.608
The shape is the second thing.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.602
The third thing operates
on a different level.

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:06.623
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,

00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:08.350
and that's great.

00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:11.443
Wouldn't that be a way to make
mobile phones more intuitive?

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:13.324
Think of a hamster in the pocket.

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:16.640
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.
I don't have to check it.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:17.690
(Laughter)

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.979
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.531
So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:25.859
But this one, it has
a breath and a heartbeat,

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:27.705
and it feels very organic.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.021
(Laughter)

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:32.342
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.697
Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.738
new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting.

00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:38.507
(Laughter)

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.553
How do we calm it down?

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:43.289
You give it a pat behind the ears,

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:45.236
and everything is all right again.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.933
That's very intuitive,
and that's what we want.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:52.052
So what we have seen are three ways
to make the digital graspable for us.

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:55.237
And I think making it physical
is a good way to do that.

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:57.769
What's behind that is a postulation,

00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:02.029
namely, not that humans should get
much more technical in the future;

00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:06.006
rather than that, technology,
a bit more human.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.331
(Applause)
