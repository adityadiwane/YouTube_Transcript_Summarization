00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
that we captured a couple weeks ago.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:32.330
(Music)

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.330
Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.330
I am overjoyed today

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.330
at being awarded the TED Prize

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
on behalf of all

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
the distinguished music teachers,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.330
artists and educators from Venezuela

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.330
in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
Since I was a boy,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
in my early childhood,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
I always wanted to be a musician,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
and, thank God, I made it.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
From my teachers, my family and my community,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
I had all the necessary support to become a musician.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
All my life I've dreamed

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.330
that all Venezuelan children

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
have the same opportunity that I had.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.330
From that desire and from my heart

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
stemmed the idea to make music

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.330
a deep and global reality for my country.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.330
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.330
I had received a donation of 50 music stands

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.330
to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.330
When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
and I said to myself,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.330
I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
into one of the leading orchestras in the world.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.330
Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
when a distinguished English critic

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
published an article in the London Times,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.330
asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
He mentioned four great world orchestras,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Today we can say

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
that art in Latin America

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.330
is no longer a monopoly of elites

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and that it has become a social right,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
a right for all the people.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.330
Child: There is no difference here between classes,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
Simply, if you are talented,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
if you have the vocation and the will to be here,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
you get in. You share with us and make music.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
JA: During the recent tour

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.330
by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
of U.S. and Europe,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
we saw how our music moved young audiences

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
to the bottom of their souls,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.330
how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
to receive the jackets from our musicians,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.330
how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
seemed to last forever,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
and how the public, after the concert was over,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.330
This meant not only an artistic triumph,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
but also a profound emotional sympathy

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.330
between the public of the most advanced nations of the world

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
and the musical youth of Latin America,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
as seen in Venezuela,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:05:00.330
giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
enthusiasm and strength.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.330
In its essence, the orchestra and the choir

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
are much more than artistic structures.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
They are examples and schools of social life,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
because to sing and to play together

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.330
means to intimately coexist

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
toward perfection and excellence,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.330
following a strict discipline of organization and coordination

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
in order to seek the harmonic interdependence

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
of voices and instruments.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
and fraternity among them,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
develop their self-esteem

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.330
and foster the ethical and aesthetical values

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.330
related to the music in all its senses.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.330
This is why music is immensely important

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.330
in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
and in the training of youngsters

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
to teach other kids.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Child: After all this time here,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
music is life.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Nothing else.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
Music is life.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.330
JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:30.330
and they are all important and of great significance to me.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.330
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.330
who passionately attended to his double bass lessons

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
With his effort,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.330
and the support of his mother, his family and his community,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
he became a principal member

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.330
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
in his hometown, Barquisimeto.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.330
There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.330
He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.330
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
and he's an unbeatable example

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
for young musicians in Latin America and the world.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
The structure of El Sistema

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:57.330
is based on a new and flexible managing style

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.330
adapted to the features of each community and region,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.330
and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
all over Venezuela.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
It's a program of social rescue

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
and deep cultural transformation

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.330
designed for the whole Venezuelan society

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:32.330
but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.330
The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
in the personal/social circle,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.330
in the family circle and in the community.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
In the personal/social circle,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
the children in the orchestras and choirs

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.330
develop their intellectual and emotional side.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
The music becomes a source

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
for developing the dimensions of the human being,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
thus elevating the spirit

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
and leading man to a full development of his personality.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:15.330
So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:24.330
the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
the sense of commitment, responsibility,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
generosity and dedication to others,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:37.330
and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:44.330
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Mother Teresa of Calcutta

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
insisted on something that always impressed me:

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.330
the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.330
is not the lack of bread or roof,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.330
but the feeling of being no-one --

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
the feeling of not being anyone,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.330
the lack of identification,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:20.330
the lack of public esteem.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
That's why the child's development

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
in the orchestra and the choir

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
provides him with a noble identity

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.330
and makes him a role model for his family and community.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.330
It makes him a better student at school

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:50.330
perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
The child becomes a role model for both his parents,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
and this is very important for a poor child.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Once the child discovers he is important to his family,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.330
he begins to seek new ways of improving himself

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:18.330
and hopes better for himself and his community.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:25.330
Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:32.330
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.330
The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.330
That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
and progress in the various opportunities

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
that music has to offer.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
Finally, in the circle of the community,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and sources of exchange and new meanings.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:09.330
The spontaneity music has

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:16.330
excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.330
It's what makes a child play a violin at home,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.330
while his father works in his carpentry.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.330
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
while her mother does the housework.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:41.330
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
that their children belong to.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.330
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
which also lies within itself,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
ends up overcoming material poverty.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
he's no longer poor.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.330
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
who'll later become a full citizen.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:14.330
Needless to say that music is the number one prevention

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
against prostitution, violence, bad habits,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and everything degrading in the life of a child.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:29.330
A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:35.330
said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:46.330
I believe that to confront such a crisis,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:55.330
only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
to mankind's deepest aspirations,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
and to the historic demands of our times.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:09.330
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:18.330
is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
more noble and more just society.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:34.330
With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:43.330
for its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:51.330
for its open and generous promotion of young values.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:59.330
We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.330
to the building of this new era in the teaching of music,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:11.330
in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
of the child and the adolescent

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.330
become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:24.330
No longer putting society at the service of art,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.330
but instead art at the service of society,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.330
at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.330
at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.330
and at the service of all those who cry for vindication

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
through the spirit of their human condition

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
and the raising up of their dignity.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.330
(Music)

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.330
(Applause)

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.330
CA: We are going live now to Caracas.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
We are going live to Caracas

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
JA: Here is my TED Prize wish:

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:15.330

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.330
a special training program

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
for 50 gifted young musicians,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.330
passionate about their art and social justice,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:33.330
and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
