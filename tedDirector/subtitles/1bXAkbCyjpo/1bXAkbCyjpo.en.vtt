00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.449
So I started working

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.333
with refugees because I wanted

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.673
to make a difference,

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:20.080
and making a difference starts

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.436
with telling their stories.

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:23.926
So when I meet refugees,

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:26.726
I always ask them questions.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.044
Who bombed your house?

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:31.697
Who killed your son?

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:35.741
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:37.727
How are you coping

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:40.258
in your life in exile?

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.261
But there's one question that always seems to me

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.725
to be most revealing, and that is:

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.907
What did you take?

00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:50.157
What was that most important thing

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.229
that you had to take with you

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.635
when the bombs were exploding in your town,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:01:00.060
and the armed gangs were approaching your house?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.665
A Syrian refugee boy I know

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:05.355
told me that he didn't hesitate

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:09.145
when his life was in imminent danger.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:12.126
He took his high school diploma,

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:14.055
and later he told me why.

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:17.263
He said, "I took my high school diploma

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:20.469
because my life depended on it."

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.698
And he would risk his life to get that diploma.

00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:27.380
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.895
His classroom sometimes shook

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:33.129
with the sound of bombs and shelling,

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:35.936
and his mother told me,

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:39.005
"Every day, I would say to him every morning,

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.931
'Honey, please don't go to school.'"

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.390
And when he insisted, she said,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.362
"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:51.392
But he said to his mother,

00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:53.237
"We're all afraid,

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:56.128
but our determination to graduate

00:01:56.128 --> 00:01:59.462
is stronger than our fear."

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:02.798
But one day, the family got terrible news.

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:05.532
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:08.221
were murdered in their homes for refusing

00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.215
to leave their house.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:12.080
Their throats were slit.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.711
It was time to flee.

00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:17.725
They left that day, right away, in their car,

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:19.586
Hany hidden in the back because they were facing

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:23.496
checkpoints of menacing soldiers.

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:27.208
And they would cross the border into Lebanon,

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.904
where they would find peace.

00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:33.586
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.590
and monotony.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.289
They had no choice but to build a shack

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.622
on the side of a muddy field,

00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.940
and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.678
who plays outside.

00:02:44.678 --> 00:02:47.100
And that day, they joined

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.304
the biggest population of refugees in the world,

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:55.330
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.981
It only has four million citizens,

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.551
and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:05.645
There's not a town, a city or a village

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:10.392
that is not host to Syrian refugees.

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.587
This is generosity and humanity

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:17.961
that is remarkable.

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.955
Think about it this way, proportionately.

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:22.711
It would be as if

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:25.702
the entire population of Germany,

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:27.567
80 million people,

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:32.957
would flee to the United States in just three years.

00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:36.118
Half of the entire population of Syria

00:03:36.118 --> 00:03:38.548
is now uprooted,

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.303
most of them inside the country.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.598
Six and a half million people

00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:45.320
have fled for their lives.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.210
Over and well over three million people

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.932
have crossed the borders

00:03:49.932 --> 00:03:53.475
and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,

00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:56.400
and only a small proportion, as you see,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.534
have moved on to Europe.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:03.205
What I find most worrying

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:07.131
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:09.369
I took this picture of this little girl.

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.294
It was just two hours after she had arrived

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:16.636
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:20.061
And most troubling of all

00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:23.802
is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children

00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:27.277
are in school in Lebanon.

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:30.210
And yet, Syrian refugee children,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.508
all refugee children tell us

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:37.574
education is the most important thing in their lives.

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:41.755
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.150
rather than the nightmare of their past.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.784
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.

00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.813
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:56.390
to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.202
and I met this girl,

00:04:58.202 --> 00:04:59.979
and I thought, "She's beautiful,"

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.686
and I went up to her and asked her,

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.634
"Can I take your picture?"

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:05.333
And she said yes,

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.370
but she refused to smile.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.419
I think she couldn't,

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.925
because I think she must realize that she represents

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:19.369
a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.950
a generation isolated and frustrated.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.496
And yet, look at what they fled:

00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:29.335
utter destruction,

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:34.914
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.

00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:37.593
Hany's home was also destroyed.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:40.806
This will need to be rebuilt

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:45.637
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.284
Communities will need teachers and lawyers

00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:53.525
and politicians interested in reconciliation

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:56.169
and not revenge.

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.924
Shouldn't this be rebuilt

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.015
by the people with the largest stake,

00:06:01.015 --> 00:06:06.880
the societies in exile, the refugees?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.634
Refugees have a lot of time

00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:11.880
to prepare for their return.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.595
You might imagine that being a refugee

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:17.103
is just a temporary state.

00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:20.044
Well far from it.

00:06:20.044 --> 00:06:23.560
With wars going on and on,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.362
the average time a refugee will spend in exile

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:30.827
is 17 years.

00:06:30.827 --> 00:06:34.415
Hany was into his second year in limbo

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:36.789
when I went to visit him recently,

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.546
and we conducted our entire conversation in English,

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:42.435
which he confessed to me he learned

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:46.089
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.444
and from listening to American rap.

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:53.189
We also spent some nice moments of laughter

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.823
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.

00:06:57.823 --> 00:06:59.444
But I'll never forget what he told me

00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:02.868
when we ended our conversation that day.

00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:05.281
He said to me,

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:10.810
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.527
Hany is one of 50 million people

00:07:14.527 --> 00:07:18.105
uprooted in this world today.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.884
Never since World War II

00:07:20.884 --> 00:07:26.151
have so many people been forcibly displaced.

00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.780
So while we're making sweeping progress

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.881
in human health,

00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:35.875
in technology, in education and design,

00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:39.238
we are doing dangerously little

00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:42.546
to help the victims

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:45.245
and we are doing far too little

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.281
to stop and prevent

00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.690
the wars that are driving them from their homes.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.133
And there are more and more victims.

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:58.267
Every day, on average,

00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:00.449
by the end of this day,

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:04.297
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:06.332
from their homes —

00:08:06.332 --> 00:08:09.244
32,000 people.

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.020
They flee across borders like this one.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.715
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.675
and this is a typical day.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.492
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,

00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:32.292
risking their lives in this case

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:34.923
just to reach safety in Europe.

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:36.638
This Syrian young man

00:08:36.638 --> 00:08:39.424
survived one of these boats that capsized —

00:08:39.424 --> 00:08:41.047
most of the people drowned —

00:08:41.047 --> 00:08:43.262
and he told us,

00:08:43.262 --> 00:08:47.421
"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place

00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.290
where nobody hurts you,

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.832
where nobody humiliates you,

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:55.543
and where nobody kills you."

00:08:55.543 --> 00:08:58.761
Well, I think that should be the minimum.

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:01.888
How about a place of healing,

00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.766
of learning,

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:07.160
and even opportunity?

00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:10.856
Americans and Europeans

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:14.107
have the impression that proportionally

00:09:14.107 --> 00:09:16.480
huge numbers of refugees are coming

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.500
to their country,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.642
but the reality is

00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:24.287
that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,

00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:26.967
are living in the developing world,

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:31.520
in countries struggling with their own insecurity,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.539
with their own issues of helping their own populations

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.662
and poverty.

00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:40.935
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize

00:09:40.935 --> 00:09:44.636
the humanity and the generosity of the countries

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:48.754
that are hosting so many refugees.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.386
And all countries should make sure that no one

00:09:52.386 --> 00:09:54.939
fleeing war and persecution

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:58.652
arrives at a closed border.

00:09:58.652 --> 00:10:01.282
(Applause)

00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:04.519
Thank you.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.505
But there is something more that we can do

00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:12.915
than just simply helping refugees survive.

00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:16.446
We can help them thrive.

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:19.506
We should think of refugee camps and communities

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:23.713
as more than just temporary population centers

00:10:23.713 --> 00:10:25.873
where people languish

00:10:25.873 --> 00:10:28.782
waiting for the war to end.

00:10:28.782 --> 00:10:32.511
Rather, as centers of excellence,

00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:36.459
where refugees can triumph over their trauma

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:39.643
and train for the day that they can go home

00:10:39.643 --> 00:10:42.724
as agents of positive change

00:10:42.724 --> 00:10:47.122
and social transformation.

00:10:47.122 --> 00:10:49.508
It makes so much sense,

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:53.817
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia

00:10:53.817 --> 00:10:57.741
that has been raging on for 22 years.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.250
And imagine living in this camp.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.823
I visited this camp.

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:03.700
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.244
and it was so remote

00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:08.685
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.

00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:12.131
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.

00:11:12.131 --> 00:11:14.425
And we went to visit a school

00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:16.342
and started talking to the children,

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.936
and then I saw this girl across the room

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:20.785
who looked to me to be the same age

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:24.066
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:25.610
And I asked her the questions

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.789
that grown-ups ask kids,

00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:29.712
like, "What is your favorite subject?"

00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:32.367
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:35.664
And this is when her face turned blank,

00:11:35.664 --> 00:11:37.714
and she said to me,

00:11:37.714 --> 00:11:40.185
"I have no future.

00:11:40.185 --> 00:11:43.162
My schooling days are over."

00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:44.810
And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.119
so I turned to my colleague

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:49.217
and she confirmed to me

00:11:49.217 --> 00:11:51.910
there is no funding for secondary education

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.180
in this camp.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.649
And how I wished at that moment

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:57.967
that I could say to her,

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.372
"We will build you a school."

00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:04.546
And I also thought, what a waste.

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:07.594
She should be and she is

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:11.925
the future of Somalia.

00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:15.131
A boy named Jacob Atem

00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:18.326
had a different chance, but not before he experienced

00:12:18.326 --> 00:12:20.418
terribly tragedy.

00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:22.882
He watched — this is in Sudan —

00:12:22.882 --> 00:12:25.176
as his village — he was only seven years old —

00:12:25.176 --> 00:12:27.558
burned to the ground, and he learned

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:29.397
that his mother and his father

00:12:29.397 --> 00:12:31.386
and his entire family

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:33.250
were killed that day.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.040
Only his cousin survived, and the two of them

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.320
walked for seven months —

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.170
this is boys like him —

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.378
chased and pursued by wild
animals and armed gangs,

00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:44.738
and they finally made it to refugee camps

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:46.271
where they found safety,

00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:48.394
and he would spend the next seven years

00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:51.581
in Kenya in a refugee camp.

00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:54.109
But his life changed

00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:56.212
when he got the chance to be resettled

00:12:56.212 --> 00:12:58.417
to the United States,

00:12:58.417 --> 00:13:01.113
and he found love in a foster family

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.701
and he was able to go to school,

00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:05.995
and he wanted me to share with you

00:13:05.995 --> 00:13:07.563
this proud moment

00:13:07.563 --> 00:13:09.868
when he graduated from university.

00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:13.810
(Applause)

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.243
I spoke to him on Skype the other day,

00:13:18.243 --> 00:13:23.237
and he was in his new university in Florida

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:26.236
pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,

00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:29.306
and he proudly told me how he was able to raise

00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:31.990
enough funds from the American public

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.575
to establish a health clinic back in his village

00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:39.655
back home.

00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:42.939
So I want to take you back to Hany.

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:45.160
When I told him I was going to have the chance

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.877
to speak to you here on the TED stage,

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:50.172
he allowed me to read you a poem

00:13:50.172 --> 00:13:53.532
that he sent in an email to me.

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:56.449
He wrote:

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.830
"I miss myself,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.335
my friends,

00:14:02.335 --> 00:14:06.590
times of reading novels or writing poems,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.515
birds and tea in the morning.

00:14:11.515 --> 00:14:16.464
My room, my books, myself,

00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:22.122
and everything that was making me smile.

00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:26.250
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.796
that were about to be realized."

00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.551
So here is my point:

00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:35.597
Not investing in refugees

00:14:35.597 --> 00:14:41.241
is a huge missed opportunity.

00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:43.092
Leave them abandoned,

00:14:43.092 --> 00:14:48.439
and they risk exploitation and abuse,

00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:51.712
and leave them unskilled and uneducated,

00:14:51.712 --> 00:14:54.265
and delay by years the return

00:14:54.265 --> 00:15:00.115
to peace and prosperity in their countries.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:03.399
I believe how we treat the uprooted

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:07.972
will shape the future of our world.

00:15:07.972 --> 00:15:10.926
The victims of war can hold the keys

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:13.447
to lasting peace,

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.256
and it's the refugees

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:18.923
who can stop the cycle of violence.

00:15:18.923 --> 00:15:21.944
Hany is at a tipping point.

00:15:21.944 --> 00:15:24.209
We would love to help him go to university

00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:27.269
and to become an engineer,

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:31.116
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:35.163
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,

00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:39.519
food rations and a bit of medicine.

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:42.916
University is a luxury.

00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:47.253
But leave him to languish in this muddy field,

00:15:47.253 --> 00:15:49.214
and he will become a member

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.636
of a lost generation.

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:57.340
Hany's story is a tragedy,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.073
but it doesn't have to end that way.

00:16:01.073 --> 00:16:03.450
Thank you.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.045
(Applause)
