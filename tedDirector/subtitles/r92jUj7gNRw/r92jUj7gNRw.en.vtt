00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:15.852
I am so excited to be here.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.680
Everything in America
is so much bigger than in Europe.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.676
Look at me -- I am huge!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.361
(Laughter)

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:23.535
It's fantastic!

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.839
And TED Talks -- TED Talks
are where everybody has great ideas.

00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:30.260
So the question is: Where do
those great ideas come from?

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:32.630
Well, it's a little bit of debate,

00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:35.192
but it's generally reckoned
that the average person --

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:36.374
that's me --

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:38.932
has about 50,000 thoughts a day.

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.114
Which is a lot,

00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:42.964
until you realize that 95 percent of them

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:45.615
are the same ones you had the day before.

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:47.842
(Laughter)

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:51.255
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:52.484
I think things like,

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:55.593
"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:57.349
Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."

00:00:57.373 --> 00:00:58.655
My most popular:

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.585
"Don't eat that cookie."

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.167
(Laughter)

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.928
So, 95 percent repetition.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.884
That leaves us with just a five percent
window of opportunity each day

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:13.857
to actually think something new.

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:16.673
And some of my new thoughts are useless.

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:19.326
The other day I was watching
some sports on television,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.076
and I was trying to decide
why I just don't engage with it.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.363
Some of it I find curious.

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:25.642
This is odd.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:27.816
(Laughter)

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:30.765
Do you think it would be
worth being that flexible

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.041
just to be able to see
your heel at that angle?

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:34.935
(Laughter)

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.969
And here's the thing:

00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:41.139
I'm never going to be able
to relate to that,

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:43.443
because I'm never going
to be able to do it, OK?

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.285
Well, not twice, anyway.

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:46.937
(Laughter)

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.467
But I'll tell you the truth.

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.294
The truth is I have never been
any good at sport, OK?

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:55.995
I've reached that wonderful age
when all my friends say,

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:59.221
"Oh, I wish I was as fit
as I was when I was 18."

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.386
And I always feel rather smug then.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.647
(Laughter)

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.270
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.619
(Laughter)

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.135
(Applause)

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.029
I couldn't run then. I'm certainly
not going to do it now.

00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:16.076
(Laughter)

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.657
So then I had my new idea:

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:20.759
Why not engage people like me in sport?

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.551
I think what the world needs now

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.497
is the Olympics for people
with zero athletic ability.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.433
(Laughter)

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.404
Oh, it would be so much more fun.

00:02:30.428 --> 00:02:32.038
We'd have three basic rules, OK?

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:35.139
Obviously no drugs;
no corruption, no skills.

00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:36.203
(Laughter)

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:37.380
It would be --

00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:39.862
No, it's a terrible idea.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:44.038
And I also know why I don't engage
with sport when I watch it on television.

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:48.649
It's because probably 97 percent of it
is about men running

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:50.199
and men kicking things,

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:53.117
men trying to look
neatly packaged in Lycra.

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.300
There is --

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:55.822
(Laughter)

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:57.584
Not always successfully.

00:02:57.608 --> 00:02:58.760
There is --

00:02:58.784 --> 00:02:59.816
(Laughter)

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.073
There is so little
female sport on television,

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.978
that a young woman watching
might be forgiven for thinking,

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:08.559
and how can I put this nicely,

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:11.180
that the male member
is the very lever you need

00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.809
to get yourself off the couch
and onto a sports ground.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.762
(Laughter)

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.806
The inequalities in sport
are breathtaking.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.267
So this is what happens to me:

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.451
I have a brand new idea,

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.193
and immediately I come back to an old one.

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:29.305
The fact is, there is not now,

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.752
nor has there ever been
in the whole of history,

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:38.642
a single country in the world
where women have equality with men.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.836
Not one.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.547
196 countries,

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.877
it hasn't happened
in the whole of evolution.

00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.871
So, here is a picture of evolution.

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:48.410
(Laughter)

00:03:51.817 --> 00:03:53.825
We women are not even in it!

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.585
(Laughter)

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:02.658
It's a wonder men have been able
to evolve quite so brilliantly.

00:04:02.682 --> 00:04:03.840
So --

00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:04.873
(Laughter)

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:08.623
It bugs me, and I know
I should do something about it.

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.235
But I'm busy, OK?

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.431
I have a full-on career,

00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:13.595
I've got three kids,
I've got an elderly mom.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.186
In fact, if I'm honest with you,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.853
one of the reasons I came out here

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:19.727
is because TED Talks said
I could have 15 minutes to myself,

00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:21.492
and I never have that much time --

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:23.885
(Laughter)

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.436
(Applause)

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:30.616
So I'm busy.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.177
And anyway, I already had a go
at changing the world.

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:34.359
Here's the thing, OK?

00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:37.539
Everybody has inside themselves
what I call an "activation button."

00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:39.949
It's the button that gets
pressed when you think,

00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:41.777
"I must do something about this."

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.023
It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.

00:04:44.047 --> 00:04:45.953
Maybe you face some kind of inequality,

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.253
or you've come across
an injustice of some kind,

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:49.818
sometimes an illness strikes,

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:52.236
or you're born in some way disadvantaged,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.077
or perhaps underprivileged.

00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.006
So I was born gay, OK?

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.290
I've always known,

00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:00.352
I don't think my family
were the least bit surprised.

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:03.594
Here is a picture of me aged four.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.401
I look cute,

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:08.576
but inside I genuinely believed
that I looked like Clint Eastwood.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.929
(Laughter)

00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:18.865
So my activation button
was pressed when I had my kids --

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.895
three wonderful kids,
born to my then-partner.

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.450
Now here's the thing:
I work on television in Britain.

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:28.415
By the time they were born,
I was already hosting my own shows

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.871
and working in the public eye.

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.046
I love what I do,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.233
but I love my kids more.

00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:36.951
And I didn't want them
to grow up with a secret.

00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:40.460
1994, when my son, my youngest was born,

00:05:40.484 --> 00:05:42.556
there was not, as far as I was aware,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.138
a single out, gay woman
in British public life.

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.526
I don't think secrets are a good thing.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.493
I think they are a cancer of the soul.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.669
So I decided to come out.

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:56.482
Everybody warned me
that I would never work again,

00:05:56.506 --> 00:06:00.062
but I decided it was
absolutely worth the risk.

00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:01.944
Well, it was hell.

00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:07.164
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
section of the right-wing press,

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:08.751
and they went nuts.

00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:13.206
And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.860
and we got death threats --

00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:17.794
enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,

00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:20.428
and we had to have police protection.

00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:25.120
And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night

00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:28.398
when I was terrified by what I had done.

00:06:28.913 --> 00:06:30.457
Eventually the dust settled.

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:33.808
Against all expectation
I carried on working,

00:06:33.832 --> 00:06:36.500
and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:39.437
I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:42.054
They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.

00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:44.911
The friend said to my son,
"What's it like having two mums?"

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:48.229
I was a little anxious to hear,
so I leant in to hear and my son said,

00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:50.475
"It's fantastic,
because if one of them's sick,

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.663
you've still got another one
to cook for you."

00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:55.264
(Laughter)

00:06:57.422 --> 00:07:01.218
So my activation button
for gay equality was pressed,

00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:03.446
and along with many, many others,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.891
I campaigned for years for gay rights,

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.082
and in particular, the right to marry
the person that I love.

00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:11.186
In the end, we succeeded.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.826
And in 2014, on the day
that the law was changed,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.996
I married my wife,
who I love very much, indeed.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.742
(Applause)

00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.924
We didn't do it in a quiet way --
we did it on the stage

00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:26.805
at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:28.367
It was a great event.

00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:30.543
The hall seats two-and-a-half
thousand people.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:34.140
We invited 150 family and friends,
then I let it be known to the public:

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:37.377
anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,
please come and join us.

00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:39.626
It would be free to anybody
who wanted to come.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.772
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.

00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:45.017
(Applause)

00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:47.996
Every kind of person you can imagine:

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.620
gays, straights, rabbis,
nuns, married people,

00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:53.199
black, white -- the whole
of humanity was there.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.897
And I remember standing
on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.556
Job done.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.943
Love triumphs.

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.379
Law changed."

00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:02.561
And I --

00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:05.304
(Applause)

00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:08.648
And I genuinely thought
my activation days were over, OK?

00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:11.085
So every year in that same hall,

00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:15.781
I host a fantastic concert to celebrate
International Women's Day.

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:18.979
We gather the world's only
all-female orchestra,

00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:22.792
we play fantastic music by forgotten
or overlooked women composers,

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:24.228
we have amazing conductors --

00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:26.546
it's Marin Alsop there
from Baltimore conducting,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.732
Petula Clark singing --

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:30.436
and I give a lecture on women's history.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.845
I love to gather inspirational stories
from the past and pass them on.

00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:38.693
Too often, I think history's what I call
the Mount Rushmore model.

00:08:38.717 --> 00:08:43.104
It looks majestic, but the women
have been entirely left out of it.

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:47.094
And I was giving a talk in 2015
about the suffragettes --

00:08:47.118 --> 00:08:50.773
I'm sure you know those magnificent
women who fought so hard

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:53.907
for the right for women
in Britain to vote.

00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.266
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.540
And boy, they succeeded,

00:08:58.564 --> 00:09:01.444
because women did indeed
get the vote in 1928.

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.222
So I'm giving this talk about this,

00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:05.842
and as I'm talking, what I realized is:

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:08.178
this was not a history
lecture I was giving;

00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:10.694
this was not something
where the job was done.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:14.346
This was something where
there was so much left to do.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.326
Nowhere in the world, for example,

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.267
do women have equal representation
in positions of power.

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:23.529
OK, let's take a very quick look
at the top 100 companies

00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:26.220
in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.

00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:29.738
Top 100 companies:
How many women running them?

00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:32.627
Seven. OK. Seven.
That's all right, I suppose.

00:09:32.651 --> 00:09:37.412
Until you realize that 17
are run by men called "John."

00:09:37.436 --> 00:09:41.633
(Laughter)

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:53.245
There are more men called John
running FTSE 100 companies --

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:55.159
(Laughter)

00:09:55.183 --> 00:09:56.718
than there are women.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.470
There are 14 run by men called "Dave."

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:01.938
(Laughter)

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.676
Now, I'm sure Dave and John
are doing a bang-up job.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.988
(Laughter)

00:10:07.012 --> 00:10:08.862
OK. Why does it matter?

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:13.185
Well, it's that pesky business
of the gender pay gap.

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:17.122
Nowhere in the world
do women earn the same as men.

00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:19.078
And that is never going to change

00:10:19.102 --> 00:10:22.725
unless we have more women
at the top in the boardroom.

00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:24.135
We have plenty of laws;

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:28.212
the Equal Pay Act in Britain
was passed in 1975.

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:31.120
Nevertheless, there are still
many, many women

00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:34.181
who, from early November
until the end of the year,

00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:36.392
by comparison to their male colleagues,

00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:39.188
are effectively working for free.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.088
In fact, the World Economic
Forum estimates

00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:44.555
that women will finally
get equal pay in ...

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:46.738
2133!

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:49.553
Yay!

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:52.213
(Laughter)

00:10:55.206 --> 00:10:56.648
That's a terrible figure.

00:10:56.672 --> 00:10:57.892
And here's the thing:

00:10:57.916 --> 00:11:00.008
the day before I came out to give my talk,

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:01.784
the World Economic Forum revised it.

00:11:01.808 --> 00:11:04.168
So that's good, because
that's a terrible -- 2133.

00:11:04.192 --> 00:11:05.917
Do you know what they revised it to?

00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:07.131
2186.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:08.698
(Laughter)

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:11.843
Yeah, another 53 years, OK?

00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:14.720
We are not going to get equal pay

00:11:14.744 --> 00:11:17.897
in my grandchildren's
grandchildren's lives

00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:19.303
under the current system.

00:11:19.327 --> 00:11:22.184
And I have waited long enough.

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:24.272
I've waited long enough
in my own business.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:28.310
In 2016 I became the very
first woman on British television

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:30.946
to host a prime-time panel show.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.006
Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.181
But --

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:35.498
(Applause)

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.849
But 2016! The first!

00:11:38.873 --> 00:11:40.835
Television's been around for 80 years!

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:41.871
(Laughter)

00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:43.843
It may be television's not so important,

00:11:43.867 --> 00:11:45.810
but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?

00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:49.837
2016, the UN were looking
for a brand new ambassador

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:52.652
to represent women's empowerment
and gender equality,

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:54.152
and who did they choose?

00:11:54.522 --> 00:11:56.287
Wonder Woman.

00:11:56.311 --> 00:11:59.622
Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:00.847
(Laughter)

00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:04.719
Because no woman was up to the job.

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:10.282
The representation of women
in positions of power is shockingly low.

00:12:10.306 --> 00:12:13.783
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
true in the British Parliament.

00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:18.198
In 2015, the number of men
elected to the Parliament that year

00:12:18.222 --> 00:12:21.103
was greater than the total number of women

00:12:21.127 --> 00:12:24.207
who have ever been members of Parliament.

00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:25.390
And why does it matter?

00:12:25.414 --> 00:12:27.677
Here's the thing:
if they're not at the table --

00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:30.797
literally, in Britain, at that table
helping to make the laws --

00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:35.344
do not be surprised if the female
perspective is overlooked.

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:38.748
It's a great role model for young people
to see a woman in charge.

00:12:38.772 --> 00:12:41.861
In 2016, Britain got its second
female Prime Minister;

00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:43.524
Theresa May came to power.

00:12:43.548 --> 00:12:45.752
The day she came to power
she was challenged:

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:46.970
just do one thing.

00:12:46.994 --> 00:12:49.982
Do one thing in the first
100 days that you're in office

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:52.947
to try and improve
lives for women in Britain.

00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:54.968
And what did she do? Nothing.

00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:56.293
Nothing.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.882
Because she's much too busy
cleaning up the mess the boys made.

00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:02.365
Even having a female leader,

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:05.383
they always find something better to do

00:13:05.407 --> 00:13:08.694
than to sort out the pesky
issue of inequality.

00:13:08.718 --> 00:13:11.560
So I keep talking about equality
like it matters. Does it?

00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:14.881
Well, let's take a very quick look
at the STEM industries, OK?

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:17.472
So science, technology,
engineering and mathematics.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:22.113
Pretty much important in every
single aspect of our daily lives.

00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:28.441
There is the thickest and most incredibly
well-documented glass ceiling

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.015
in the STEM industries.

00:13:30.504 --> 00:13:32.488
What if the cure for cancer

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.113
or the answer the global warming

00:13:34.137 --> 00:13:39.082
lies in the head of a young female
scientist who fails to progress?

00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:42.553
So I thought all these things,

00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:47.503
and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."

00:13:47.968 --> 00:13:49.939
And I spoke to my wonderful friend,

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.690
brilliant journalist
Catherine Mayer in Britain,

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:54.164
and we rather foolishly --

00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:57.390
and I suspect there was wine involved --

00:13:57.414 --> 00:13:59.168
(Laughter)

00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:02.837
We decided to found
a brand new political party.

00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:04.487
Because here's the critical thing:

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:09.409
the one place women and men
are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.

00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:11.425
We had no idea what we were doing,

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:14.547
we didn't know how complicated
it was to start a political party.

00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:18.106
I thought, "It can't be that difficult,
men have been doing it for years."

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.287
(Laughter)

00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:25.597
So we started by calling it
"The Women's Equality Party."

00:14:26.143 --> 00:14:27.844
And straightaway people said to me,

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.322
"Why did you call it that?"

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.922
I said, "I don't know,
I just thought we'd be clear."

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:35.462
(Laughter)

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:43.307
I didn't want what we were doing
to be a secret, you know? I just --

00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.624
(Laughter)

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:47.874
Some people said, "You can't call it that!
It's much too feminist!"

00:14:47.898 --> 00:14:49.726
Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:53.256
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard somebody say,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.454
"I'm not a feminist, but ..."

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.440
And I always think
if there's a "but" in the sentence,

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.233
it can't all be roses in the garden.

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:03.261
And then I started getting asked
the hilarious question,

00:15:03.285 --> 00:15:05.199
"Are you all going to burn your bras?"

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:09.581
Yes! Because bras are famously
made of flammable material.

00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:11.359
(Laughter)

00:15:12.032 --> 00:15:14.850
That's why all women spark when they walk.

00:15:14.874 --> 00:15:16.603
(Laughter)

00:15:19.738 --> 00:15:23.038
Here's quick history sidebar for you:

00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:25.597
no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.

00:15:25.621 --> 00:15:27.443
It's a story made up by a journalist.

00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:30.092
Thank goodness journalism
has improved since then.

00:15:30.116 --> 00:15:31.271
So --

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.653
(Laughter)

00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:35.936
I announced what we were going
to do in a broadcast interview,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.062
and straightaway,
the emails started coming.

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:40.329
First hundreds,
then thousands and thousands,

00:15:40.353 --> 00:15:44.153
from every age group: from the very young
to women in their '90s,

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.559
to hundreds of wonderful men.

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.595
People wrote and said,
"Please, can I help?

00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:49.835
Please, can I visit you
at party headquarters?"

00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:52.527
We didn't have a headquarters --
we didn't have a party!

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.749
We didn't have anything.

00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:57.672
All we had was a wonderful,
tight group of fabulous friends

00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:02.381
trying to answer emails
pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.

00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:04.242
We were all busy.

00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:06.552
Many of us had careers,
many of us had children,

00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:09.311
but we did what women do,
and we shared the work.

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.773
And almost instantly, we agreed
on certain fundamental things.

00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:16.289
First thing: we want to be
the only political party in the world

00:16:16.313 --> 00:16:19.018
whose main aim was
to no longer need to exist.

00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:20.847
That's a fantastic idea.

00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:24.701
We wanted to be the only political party
with no particular political leaning.

00:16:24.725 --> 00:16:27.822
We wanted people from the left,
from the right, from the middle,

00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:28.998
every age group.

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:31.837
Because the whole point
was to work with a simple agenda:

00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:35.080
let's get equality
in every aspect of our lives,

00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:36.260
and when we're finished,

00:16:36.284 --> 00:16:38.519
let's go home and get
the other chores done.

00:16:38.543 --> 00:16:39.625
(Laughter)

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:42.056
And we wanted to change
how politics is conducted.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.563
I don't know if you have this,

00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:46.024
but in Britain we have
two major political parties.

00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:47.696
They're the dinosaurs of politics.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.258
And how they speak to each other
is shameful and poisonous.

00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:54.353
I'm sure you've never had
that kind of name-calling --

00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:55.722
(Laughter)

00:16:56.546 --> 00:16:58.163
And lying here.

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:01.436
Wouldn't it be great
if just one politician said,

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.355
"Do you know, my opponent has a point.

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.778
Let's see if we can't work together
and get the job done."

00:17:06.802 --> 00:17:11.319
(Applause)

00:17:13.163 --> 00:17:15.576
And let's get more women
into politics, OK?

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.774
Let's immediately get
more women into politics

00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:21.484
by being the only political party
to offer free childcare to our candidates,

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:24.181
so they can get out of the house
and start campaigning.

00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:26.461
(Applause)

00:17:27.596 --> 00:17:30.022
Within 10 months,

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:33.994
we had more than 70 branches
of our party across the UK.

00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:37.177
We stood candidates for election
in London, Scotland and Wales

00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:38.765
in May 2016.

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:42.334
One in 20 people voted
for our candidate for London Mayor.

00:17:42.358 --> 00:17:47.551
And when the men in the race
saw how many votes we were attracting,

00:17:47.575 --> 00:17:48.749
wonder of wonders,

00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:53.103
they began to talk about the need
to tackle gender equality.

00:17:53.127 --> 00:17:56.187
(Applause)

00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:02.236
You know, I've been promised
change since I was a child.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.317
It was always coming:

00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:06.039
women were going to stand
shoulder to shoulder with men.

00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:08.546
All I got were empty promises
and disappointment --

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.940
enough disappointment
to found a political party.

00:18:11.964 --> 00:18:15.070
But here is my new idea for today --
this is my five percent, OK?

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.693
And this one is really good.

00:18:16.717 --> 00:18:19.463
The fact is, this is not enough.

00:18:19.487 --> 00:18:24.549
It is not enough to found one political
party for equality in a single country.

00:18:24.573 --> 00:18:29.120
What we need is a seismic change
in the global political landscape.

00:18:29.144 --> 00:18:31.838
And the wonderful thing
about the model we have created

00:18:31.862 --> 00:18:33.737
is that it would work anywhere.

00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:35.421
It would work in America,

00:18:35.445 --> 00:18:37.839
it would work in Australia,
it would work in India.

00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:40.770
It's like we've made the perfect recipe:
anybody can cook it,

00:18:40.794 --> 00:18:42.190
and it's good for everybody.

00:18:42.214 --> 00:18:43.837
And we want to give it away.

00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:46.579
If you want to know what we did,
we're giving it away.

00:18:46.603 --> 00:18:52.217
Can you imagine if we could mobilize
millions of women across the world

00:18:52.241 --> 00:18:55.559
to say, "That's enough!"
to the traditional battles of politics?

00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.617
To say, "Stop the bickering,
let's get the work done."

00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:01.948
We could literally change the world.

00:19:01.972 --> 00:19:03.389
And I want that.

00:19:03.413 --> 00:19:06.825
(Applause)

00:19:08.707 --> 00:19:10.080
I want ...

00:19:10.104 --> 00:19:11.555
(Applause)

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:14.514
I want that for our daughters,

00:19:14.538 --> 00:19:16.041
and I want it for our sons.

00:19:16.065 --> 00:19:20.457
Because the fact is:
equality is better for everyone.

00:19:20.481 --> 00:19:23.412
Come on people, let's activate!
Let's change the world!

00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:26.292
I know we can do it, and it wants doing!

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:30.815
(Applause)
