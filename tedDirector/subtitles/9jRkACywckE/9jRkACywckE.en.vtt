00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.626
When I was a young officer, they told me

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:16.894
to follow my instincts,

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:19.150
to go with my gut,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.160
and what I've learned

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.544
is that often our instincts are wrong.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:28.720
In the summer of 2010,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.059
there was a massive leak of classified documents

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.032
that came out of the Pentagon.

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:36.848
It shocked the world,

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:38.423
it shook up the American government,

00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:40.576
and it made people ask a lot of questions,

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:43.257
because the sheer amount of information

00:00:43.257 --> 00:00:46.832
that was let out, and the potential impacts,

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.408
were significant.

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:53.430
And one of the first questions we asked ourselves

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.148
was why would a young soldier have access

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.080
to that much information?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.606
Why would we let sensitive things

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:05.764
be with a relatively young person?

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.886
In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:11.390
a special operations task force,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.530
and that task force was spread across the Mideast

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.118
to fight al Qaeda.

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:18.115
Our main effort was inside Iraq,

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.082
and our specified mission

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:21.936
was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:25.040
For almost five years I stayed there,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.850
and we focused on fighting a war

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.896
that was unconventional and it was difficult

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:33.736
and it was bloody

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:36.830
and it often claimed its highest price

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.904
among innocent people.

00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:42.409
We did everything we could

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.318
to stop al Qaeda

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:47.603
and the foreign fighters that
came in as suicide bombers

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:52.718
and as accelerants to the violence.

00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:54.740
We honed our combat skills,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.576
we developed new equipment,

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:00.030
we parachuted, we helicoptered,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.488
we took small boats, we drove, and we walked

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:05.498
to objectives night after night to stop

00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:10.850
the killing that this network was putting forward.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.390
We bled,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.879
we died,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.730
and we killed to stop that organization

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.473
from the violence that they were putting

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:25.702
largely against the Iraqi people.

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:28.280
Now, we did what we knew,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.194
how we had grown up, and
one of the things that we knew,

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:34.320
that was in our DNA, was secrecy.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.237
It was security. It was protecting information.

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:39.050
It was the idea that information was the lifeblood

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.690
and it was what would protect and keep people safe.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.585
And we had a sense that,

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:46.596
as we operated within our organizations,

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.514
it was important to keep information

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.825
in the silos within the organizations,

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:53.739
particularly only give information

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.931
to people had a demonstrated need to know.

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.570
But the question often came, who needed to know?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.933
Who needed, who had to have the information

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:09.004
so that they could do the important 
parts of the job that you needed?

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.056
And in a tightly coupled world,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.854
that's very hard to predict.

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:16.798
It's very hard to know who needs to have information

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:18.305
and who doesn't.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.284
I used to deal with intelligence agencies,

00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:22.451
and I'd complain that they weren't
sharing enough intelligence,

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.841
and with a straight face, they'd
look at me and they'd say,

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:26.988
"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter)

00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:32.470
I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.072
But what we found is we had to change.

00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:36.249
We had to change our culture about information.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.366
We had to knock down walls. We had to share.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:41.434
We had to change from who needs to know

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:43.557
to the fact that who doesn't know,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.791
and we need to tell, and tell
them as quickly as we can.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.917
It was a significant culture shift for an organization

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:55.241
that had secrecy in its DNA.

00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.517
We started by doing things, by building,

00:03:57.517 --> 00:03:59.222
not working in offices,

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:00.887
knocking down walls, working in things we called

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.345
situation awareness rooms,

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.821
and in the summer of 2007,

00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:07.444
something happened which demonstrated this.

00:04:07.444 --> 00:04:09.636
We captured the personnel records

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:11.836
for the people who were bringing foreign fighters

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:13.991
into Iraq.

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.839
And when we got the personnel records, typically,

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.153
we would have hidden these,

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:19.491
shared them with a few intelligence agencies,

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.287
and then try to operate with them.

00:04:21.287 --> 00:04:23.325
But as I was talking to my intelligence officer,

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:24.175
I said, "What do we do?"

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:27.201
And he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.565
"You can just declassify them."

00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:31.213
And I said, "Well, can we declassify them?

00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:32.223
What if the enemy finds out?"

00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:34.835
And he says, "They're their personnel records."

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.235
(Laughter)

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:37.317
So we did,

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.351
and a lot of people got upset about that,

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:41.835
but as we passed that information around,

00:04:41.835 --> 00:04:44.725
suddenly you find that information is only of value

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:46.581
if you give it to people who have the ability

00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:48.719
to do something with it.

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.845
The fact that I know something has zero value

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:52.333
if I'm not the person who can actually

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.207
make something better because of it.

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:56.083
So as a consequence, what we did was

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:59.193
we changed the idea of information,

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:01.477
instead of knowledge is power,

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.423
to one where sharing is power.

00:05:04.423 --> 00:05:06.395
It was the fundamental shift,

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:08.733
not new tactics, not new weapons,

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:10.037
not new anything else.

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:12.815
It was the idea that we were now part of a team

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.163
in which information became the essential link

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:19.661
between us, not a block between us.

00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.243
And I want everybody to take a deep breath

00:05:22.243 --> 00:05:24.365
and let it out,

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:26.299
because in your life, there's going to be information

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.631
that leaks out you're not going to like.

00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.877
Somebody's going to get my college grades out,

00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:34.904
a that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)

00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:38.273
But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that

00:05:38.273 --> 00:05:41.493
I am more scared of the bureaucrat

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:43.945
that holds information in a desk drawer

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:46.741
or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,

00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:49.677
because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:51.437
Thank you.

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:55.839
(Applause)

00:05:57.761 --> 00:05:59.337
Helen Walters: So I don't know if
you were here this morning,

00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:01.637
if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:03.469
the deputy director of the NSA

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.133
who was responding to Edward
Snowden's talk earlier this week.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.445
I just wonder, do you think the American government

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:12.133
should give Edward Snowden amnesty?

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.581
Stanley McChrystal: I think that
Rick said something very important.

00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:17.201
We, most people, don't know all the facts.

00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:18.553
I think there are two parts of this.

00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:22.293
Edward Snowden shined a
light on an important need

00:06:22.293 --> 00:06:23.783
that people had to understand.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:26.765
He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have

00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:29.357
the knowledge to know the importance of,

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:31.790
so I think we need to learn the facts about this case

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.337
before we make snap judgments

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:35.485
about Edward Snowden.

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:37.669
HW: Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.587
(Applause)
