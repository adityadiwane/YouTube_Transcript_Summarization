00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
I'm going to be talking to you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
about how we can tap

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
a really underutilized resource in health care,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
which is the patient,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
or, as I like to use the scientific term,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
people.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Because we are all patients, we are all people.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
Even doctors are patients at some point.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
So I want to talk about that

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
as an opportunity

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and, in fact, worldwide.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
If you want to get at the big part --

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
I mean from a public health level, where my training is --

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
you're looking at behavioral issues.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
You're looking at things where people are actually given information,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and they're not following through with it.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
obesity, many forms of heart disease,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
They know what they're supposed to be doing,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
but they're not doing it.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
Now behavior change is something

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
that is a long-standing problem in medicine.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
It goes all the way back to Aristotle.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
And doctors hate it, right?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
I mean, they complain about it all the time.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
When people don't take their pills,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
when people don't follow doctors' orders --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
these are behavior problems.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
But for as much as clinical medicine

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
agonizes over behavior change,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
there's not a lot of work done

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
in terms of trying to fix that problem.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
So the crux of it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
comes down to this notion of decision-making --

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
giving information to people in a form

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
that doesn't just educate them

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
or inform them,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
but actually leads them to make better decisions,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
better choices in their lives.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
One part of medicine, though,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
and that's dentistry.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
many dentists would have to acknowledge

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and solved it.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
It's the one great preventive health success

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
we have in our health care system.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
People brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
So I'm going to talk about one experiment

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
that a few dentists in Connecticut

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
cooked up about 30 years ago.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
because it was very simple,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
so it's an easy story to tell.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
So these Connecticut dentists decided

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
and they were going to use one variable:

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
they wanted to scare them.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
if they didn't brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
They had a big patient population.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
They divided them up into two groups.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
They had a low-fear population,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
all based in science,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
So that was the low-fear group.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
They showed bloody gums.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
They said that they could have infections

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
you weren't going to be able to eat apples,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
you weren't going to be able to eat steak.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
So go brush and floss your teeth.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
That was the message. That was the experiment.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Now they measured one other variable.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
They wanted to capture one other variable,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
which was the patients' sense of efficacy.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
This was the notion of whether the patients felt

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
So they asked them at the beginning,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
they were characterized as high efficacy,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
and the people who said,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
they were characterized as low efficacy.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
So the upshot was this.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
The upshot of this experiment

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
was that fear was not really a primary driver

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
of the behavior at all.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
were not necessarily the people

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
who were really scared about what would happen --

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
to change their behavior.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
So fear showed up as not really the driver.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
It was the sense of efficacy.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
So I want to isolate this,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
because it was a great observation --

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
and it's one that's laid fallow in research.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
It was a notion that really came out

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
of Albert Bandura's work,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
who studied whether

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
people could get a sense of empowerment.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
In health care terms, you could characterize this

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
as whether or not somebody feels

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
that they see a path towards better health,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and that's a very important notion.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
It's an amazing notion.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Except, maybe we do.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
And this is a great example

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
of how we haven't learned that lesson at all.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
And I don't know if it works.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Now here's what does work:

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
personalized information works.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Again, Bandura recognized this

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
years ago, decades ago.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
When you give people specific information

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
about their health, where they stand,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and where they want to get to, where they might get to,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
that path, that notion of a path --

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
that tends to work for behavior change.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
So let me just spool it out a little bit.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
So you start with personalized data, personalized information

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
that comes from an individual,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
and then you need to connect it to their lives.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
You need to connect it to their lives,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
this overload of health information

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
that we're inundated with.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
But it actually hits home.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
There's an emotional connection to information

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
because it's from us.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
That information then needs to be connected to choices,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
needs to be connected to a range of options,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
directions that we might go to --

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
trade-offs, benefits.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
We need to connect the information

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
always with the action,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
and then that action feeds back

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
into different information,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
for behavior change.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
It's a difficult and expensive commodity,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
until now.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
You've seen them all around,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
especially these days as radars are cheaper.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And here's how they work in the feedback loop.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
So you start with the personalized data

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
is 25,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and, of course, you're going faster than that.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
The choice in this case is pretty simple.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
We either keep going fast, or we slow down.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
We should probably slow down,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and that point of action is probably now.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
We should take our foot off the pedal right now,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
in terms of getting people to slow down.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
They last for about five miles,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
But by and large, this is a feedback loop

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
that's so nifty and too rare.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
Because in health care, most health care,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
the data is very removed from the action.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
But we have an opportunity.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
how we deliver health information in this country,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
how we actually get information.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
This is a pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Nobody's had the brilliant idea

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
But it looks completely right.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
So it's exactly the way we get

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
health information and pharmaceutical information,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
and it just sounds perfect.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
And then we turn the page of the magazine,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
and we see this --

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
to put into their ads, or to follow their ads,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
and to me, this is one of the most 
cynical exercises in medicine.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
Because we know.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Who among us would actually say that people read this?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
And who among us would actually say

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
that people who do try to read this

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
actually get anything out of it?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
This is a bankrupt effort

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
at communicating health information.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
There is no good faith in this.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
So this is a different approach.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
This is an approach that has been developed

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
They took inspiration from, of all things,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Cap'n Crunch.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
They went to the nutritional information box

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
actually helps people understand what's in their food.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
God forbid we should use that same standard

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
that we make Cap'n Crunch live by

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
and bring it to drug companies.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
So let me just walk through this quickly.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
so you can start to personalize your understanding

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
of whether the information is relevant to you

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
or whether the drug is relevant to you.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
but you get the statistics for how effective it is.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And finally, you understand what those choices are.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
You can start to unpack the choices involved

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
because of the side effects.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
So it spells those out in very clean terms,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
and that works.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
So I love this. I love that drug facts box.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
And so I was thinking about,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
what's an opportunity that I could have

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
to help people understand information?

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.330
What's another latent body of information that's out there

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
that people are really not putting to use?

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
And so I came up with this: lab test results.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
Blood test results are this great source of information.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
They're packed with information.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
They go right to doctors.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
they don't really understand all this stuff either.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
This is the worst presented information.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
You ask Tufte, and he would say,

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
What we did at Wired

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
was we went, and I got our graphic design department

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
to re-imagine these lab reports.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
So that's what I want to walk you through.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
So this is the general blood work before,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
and this is the after, this is what we came up with.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
The after takes what was four pages --

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
that previous slide was actually

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
the first of four pages of data

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
that's just the general blood work.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
This is our one-page summary.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
We use the notion of color.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
It's an amazing notion that color could be used.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
So on the top-level you have your overall results,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Then you can drill down

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
and understand how actually we put your level in context,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
and we use color to illustrate

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
exactly where your value falls.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
because of their glucose level.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
Likewise, you can go over your lipids

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
But again, always using color

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
and personalized proximity

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
to that information.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
All those other values,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
we summarize.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
And then we do two other very important things

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
that kind of help fill in this feedback loop:

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
we help people understand in a little more detail

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
what these values are and what they might indicate.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
We give them some insight

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
into what choices they can make, what actions they can take.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
So that's our general blood work test.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
Then we went to CRP test.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
In this case, it's a sin of omission.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
They have this huge amount of space,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
and they don't use it for anything, so we do.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
Now the CRP test is often done

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
following a cholesterol test,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
So we take the bold step

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
of putting the cholesterol information on the same page,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
It's a protein that shows up

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
when your blood vessels might be inflamed,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
which might be a risk for heart disease.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
What you're actually measuring

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
is spelled out in clean language.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Then we use the information

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
that's already in the lab report.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
We use the person's age and their gender

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
to start to fill in the personalized risks.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
So we start to use the data we have

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
to run a very simple calculation

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
that's on all sorts of online calculators

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
to get a sense of what the actual risk is.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
Here's the before, and here's the after.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
Now a lot of our effort on this one --

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
as many of you probably know,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
a PSA test is a very controversial test.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
It's used to test for prostate cancer,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
but there are all sorts of reasons

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
why your prostate might be enlarged.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
And so we spent a good deal of our time

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
indicating that.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
We again personalized the risks.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
So this patient is in their 50s,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
so we can actually give them a very precise estimate

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
of what their risk for prostate cancer is.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
And then again, the follow-up actions.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
That's what Wired magazine spent on this.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
Why is Wired magazine doing this?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
(Laughter)

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
the two largest lab testing companies --

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
and over 500 million dollars respectively.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
Now this is not a problem of resources;

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
this is a problem of incentives.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
We need to recognize that the target of this information

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
It should be the patient.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
It's the person who actually, in the end,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
is going to be having to change their lives

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
and then start adopting new behaviors.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
This is information that is incredibly powerful.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
It's being lost.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
So I want to just offer four questions

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
that every patient should ask,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
because I don't actually expect people

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
to start developing these lab test reports.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
But you can create your own feedback loop.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
Can I have my results?

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
And the only acceptable answer is --

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
What are my options? What choices are now on the table?

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
And then, what's next?

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
How do I integrate this information

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
into the longer course of my life?

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
So I want to wind up by just showing

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
that people have the capacity to understand this information.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.330
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
in a form that they can engage with.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
And engagement is essential here,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
because it's not just giving them information;

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
it's giving them an opportunity to act.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
in medicine today.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
And this information is out there.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
I've been talking today about latent information,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
all this information that exists in the system

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
that we're not putting to use.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
But there are all sorts of other bodies of information

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.330
that are coming online,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
and we need to recognize the capacity of this information

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
to engage people, to help people

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
and to change the course of their lives.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
Thank you very much.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
