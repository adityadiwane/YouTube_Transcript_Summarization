00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.947
Chris Anderson: So, this is an
interview with a difference.

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:21.015
On the basis that a picture
is worth a thousand words,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.911
what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.118
to dig out from their archive

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:28.216
some images that would help explain

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:29.652
some of what they've done,

00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:32.249
and do a few things that way.

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:35.980
So, we're going to start here.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.183
Melinda, when and where was this,

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.217
and who is that handsome man next to you?

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:42.226
Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:44.265
This is in Africa, our very first trip,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.170
the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.780
in the fall of 1993.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.768
We were already engaged to be married.

00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:51.474
We married a few months later,

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:53.691
and this was the trip where we really went to see

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:55.583
the animals and to see the savanna.

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.571
It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time

00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.983
off from work.

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:03.610
But what really touched us, actually, were the people,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.218
and the extreme poverty.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:07.791
We started asking ourselves questions.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.595
Does it have to be like this?

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:10.546
And at the end of the trip,

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:11.646
we went out to Zanzibar,

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:13.134
and took some time to walk on the beach,

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:14.500
which is something we had done a lot

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.818
while we were dating.

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:18.791
And we'd already been talking about during that time

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:20.648
that the wealth that had come from Microsoft

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:21.923
would be given back to society,

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:23.497
but it was really on that beach walk

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:25.069
that we started to talk about, well,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.602
what might we do and how might we go about it?

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.334
CA: So, given that this vacation

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.526
led to the creation of

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:36.342
the world's biggest private foundation,

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:39.474
it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.942
MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:44.840
CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.793
or was it symmetrical?

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:50.186
Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:51.653
that there'd be a phase of our life

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.714
where we'd get to work together

00:01:53.714 --> 00:02:00.325
and figure out how to give this money back.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:03.474
At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:05.876
and could you have a big impact on them?

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.801
Were there things that weren't being done?

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.701
There was a lot we didn't know.

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:11.789
Our naïveté is pretty incredible,

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.881
when we look back on it.

00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:14.437
But we had a certain enthusiasm

00:02:14.437 --> 00:02:17.434
that that would be the phase,

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:20.160
the post-Microsoft phase

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.388
would be our philanthropy.

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.534
MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:25.670
after he was 60,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.332
so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,

00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:30.525
so some things change along the way.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.969
CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.489
So that was '93, and it was '97, really,

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.227
before the foundation itself started.

00:02:37.227 --> 00:02:39.532
MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:42.946
about diarrheal diseases killing
so many kids around the world,

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:44.560
and we kept saying to ourselves,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.800
"Well that can't be.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.554
In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:49.719
And so we started gathering scientists

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.185
and started learning about population,

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:53.545
learning about vaccines,

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.932
learning about what had worked and what had failed,

00:02:55.932 --> 00:02:57.838
and that's really when we got going,

00:02:57.838 --> 00:03:02.215
was in late 1998, 1999.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.966
CA: So, you've got a big pot of money

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.293
and a world full of so many different issues.

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:11.515
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.060
BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.920
whatever the biggest inequity was globally,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.180
and there we looked at children dying,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.920
children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.419
and countries that were really stuck,

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.679
because with that level of death,

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.647
and parents would have so many kids

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.165
that they'd get huge population growth,

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:32.291
and that the kids were so sick

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.937
that they really couldn't be educated

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:36.809
and lift themselves up.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:37.917
So that was our global thing,

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.637
and then in the U.S.,

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.411
both of us have had amazing educations,

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:46.460
and we saw that as the way that the U.S.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.472
could live up to its promise of equal opportunity

00:03:49.472 --> 00:03:52.057
is by having a phenomenal education system,

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.685
and the more we learned, the more we realized

00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:57.113
we're not really fulfilling that promise.

00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:58.950
And so we picked those two things,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.602
and everything the foundation does

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.616
is focused there.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:05.952
CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image

00:04:05.952 --> 00:04:08.384
that you like that illustrates your work,

00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:11.452
and Melinda, this is what you picked.

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:12.919
What's this about?

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.950
MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.060
is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.658
whether it's Bangladesh, India,
lots of countries in Africa,

00:04:21.658 --> 00:04:24.066
and I go in as a Western woman without a name.

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:27.475
I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.979
And I kept hearing from women,

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.862
over and over and over, the more I traveled,

00:04:31.862 --> 00:04:34.271
"I want to be able to use this shot."

00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.840
I would be there to talk to them
about childhood vaccines,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.240
and they would bring the conversation around to

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.221
"But what about the shot I get?"

00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:43.673
which is an injection they were
getting called Depo-Provera,

00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:45.654
which is a contraceptive.

00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:47.986
And I would come back and
talk to global health experts,

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:49.539
and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.931
are stocked in in the developing world."

00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.921
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.697
and this is what the team came to me with,

00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:57.843
which is, to have the number one thing

00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:00.981
that women tell you in Africa they want to use

00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.598
stocked out more than 200 days a year

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:05.502
explains why women were saying to me,

00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:09.054
"I walked 10 kilometers without
my husband knowing it,

00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:12.363
and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."

00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:15.170
And so condoms were stocked in in Africa

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.447
because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.

00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:18.851
and others supported.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.522
But women will tell you over and over again,

00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:23.132
"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.

00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:27.340
I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.100
and I need that tool because then I can space

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.517
the births of my children, and I can feed them

00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:35.055
and have a chance of educating them."

00:05:35.055 --> 00:05:37.105
CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,

00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:40.674
and you've often been embroiled

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.628
in controversy over this issue,

00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:44.877
and on the abortion question,

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.332
on both sides, really.

00:05:46.332 --> 00:05:48.023
How do you navigate that?

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:51.133
MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:54.216
which is, we had backed away from contraceptives

00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:55.383
as a global community.

00:05:55.383 --> 00:05:58.677
We knew that 210 million women

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.936
were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:03.576
even the contraceptives we have
here in the United States,

00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:05.881
and we weren't providing them

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:09.632
because of the political controversy in our country,

00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:11.809
and to me that was just a crime,

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:14.574
and I kept looking around trying to find the person

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.924
that would get this back on the global stage,

00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:18.930
and I finally realized I just had to do it.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.601
And even though I'm Catholic,

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.042
I believe in contraceptives

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:24.338
just like most of the Catholic
women in the United States

00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:26.169
who report using contraceptives,

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.454
and I shouldn't let that controversy

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.269
be the thing that holds us back.

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:32.227
We used to have consensus in the United States

00:06:32.227 --> 00:06:33.492
around contraceptives,

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:35.972
and so we got back to that global consensus,

00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:38.616
and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:41.149
around exactly this issue for women.

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:46.616
(Applause)

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.105
CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:55.090
BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.208
(Laughter)

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.025
I really like this graph.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:02.000
This is the number of children

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.562
who die before the age of five every year.

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:06.405
And what you find is really

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.355
a phenomenal success story

00:07:08.355 --> 00:07:10.509
which is not widely known,

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.184
that we are making incredible progress.

00:07:13.184 --> 00:07:15.562
We go from 20 million

00:07:15.562 --> 00:07:17.266
not long after I was born

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:20.952
to now we're down to about six million.

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:23.089
So this is a story

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:24.756
largely of vaccines.

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:27.880
Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.070
That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.910
Measles was killing a couple million a year.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.613
That's down to a few hundred thousand.

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.521
Anyway, this is a chart

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:39.708
where you want to get that number to continue,

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.448
and it's going to be possible,

00:07:41.448 --> 00:07:43.124
using the science of new vaccines,

00:07:43.124 --> 00:07:45.016
getting the vaccines out to kids.

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.740
We can actually accelerate the progress.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.303
The last decade,

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:50.115
that number has dropped faster

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:52.393
than ever in history,

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:55.116
and so I just love the fact that

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:57.381
you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,

00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:58.889
we can get them out there,

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.374
use the very latest understanding of these things,

00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:05.985
and get the delivery right, that
we can perform a miracle.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.143
CA: I mean, you do the math on this,

00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:09.017
and it works out, I think, literally

00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:11.143
to thousands of kids' lives saved every day

00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:13.197
compared to the prior year.

00:08:13.197 --> 00:08:15.044
It's not reported.

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:18.290
An airliner with 200-plus deaths

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.500
is a far, far bigger story than that.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.049
Does that drive you crazy?

00:08:22.049 --> 00:08:25.040
BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.710
It's a kid, one kid at a time.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.173
Ninety-eight percent of this

00:08:29.173 --> 00:08:31.050
has nothing to do with natural disasters,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.527
and yet, people's charity,

00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:34.050
when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.286
It's incredible how people think, okay,

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:39.062
that could be me, and the money flows.

00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:42.468
These causes have been a bit invisible.

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:44.679
Now that the Millennium Development Goals

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:46.229
and various things are getting out there,

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:49.073
we are seeing some increased generosity,

00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:52.344
so the goal is to get this well below a million,

00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:54.762
which should be possible in our lifetime.

00:08:54.762 --> 00:08:55.942
CA: Maybe it needed someone

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:58.038
who is turned on by numbers and graphs

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.452
rather than just the big, sad face

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:02.107
to get engaged.

00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:03.830
I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.281
you used basically this argument to say that aid,

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.952
contrary to the current meme

00:09:08.952 --> 00:09:12.035
that aid is kind of worthless and broken,

00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:13.988
that actually it has been effective.

00:09:13.988 --> 00:09:15.968
BG: Yeah, well people can take,

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:19.148
there is some aid that was well-meaning

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:21.071
and didn't go well.

00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:23.004
There's some venture capital investments

00:09:23.004 --> 00:09:25.904
that were well-meaning and didn't go well.

00:09:25.904 --> 00:09:28.743
You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:31.861
because we don't have a perfect record,

00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:33.393
this is a bad endeavor.

00:09:33.393 --> 00:09:35.263
You should look at, what was your goal?

00:09:35.263 --> 00:09:37.871
How are you trying to uplift nutrition

00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:41.275
and survival and literacy

00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:42.910
so these countries can take care of themselves,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.914
and say wow, this is going well,

00:09:44.914 --> 00:09:46.186
and be smarter.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.026
We can spend aid smarter.

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:51.438
It is not all a panacea.

00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:54.370
We can do better than venture capital, I think,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.157
including big hits like this.

00:09:57.157 --> 00:09:59.900
CA: Traditional wisdom is that

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.948
it's pretty hard for married couples to work together.

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:05.564
How have you guys managed it?

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.234
MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,

00:10:07.234 --> 00:10:09.093
"I really don't think I could work with my husband.

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:11.240
That just wouldn't work out."

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.829
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.315
this foundation has been a coming to for both of us

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:20.143
in its continuous learning journey,

00:10:20.143 --> 00:10:22.902
and we don't travel together as much

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:24.830
for the foundation, actually, as we used to

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.286
when Bill was working at Microsoft.

00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:28.509
We have more trips where
we're traveling separately,

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:30.651
but I always know when I come home,

00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:32.790
Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.533
whether it's about women or girls

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.219
or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.455
or this person that is a great leader.

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:41.922
He's going to listen and be really interested.

00:10:41.922 --> 00:10:43.525
And he knows when he comes home,

00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:45.358
even if it's to talk about the speech he did

00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:47.100
or the data or what he's learned,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.342
I'm really interested,

00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:51.242
and I think we have a really
collaborative relationship.

00:10:51.242 --> 00:10:53.916
But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.

00:10:53.916 --> 00:10:58.091
(Laughter)

00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:00.586
CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:04.172
Melinda, early on, you were basically

00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:06.173
largely running the show.

00:11:06.173 --> 00:11:07.385
Six years ago, I guess,

00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:09.968
Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft

00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:11.079
and became full time.

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:12.058
That must have been hard,

00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:14.094
adjusting to that. No?

00:11:14.094 --> 00:11:17.148
MG: Yeah. I think actually,

00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:19.137
for the foundation employees,

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.684
there was way more angst for them

00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:23.050
than there was for me about Bill coming.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.256
I was actually really excited.

00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:25.875
I mean, Bill made this decision

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:28.558
even obviously before it got announced in 2006,

00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:30.260
and it was really his decision,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.146
but again, it was a beach vacation

00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:33.450
where we were walking on the beach

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.714
and he was starting to think of this idea.

00:11:35.714 --> 00:11:38.326
And for me, the excitement of Bill

00:11:38.326 --> 00:11:41.035
putting his brain and his heart

00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.382
against these huge global problems,

00:11:43.382 --> 00:11:45.710
these inequities, to me that was exciting.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.444
Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.

00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:51.119
(Applause)

00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:53.235
CA: That's cool.

00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:54.919
MG: But that went away within three months,

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:55.846
once he was there.

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:57.511
BG: Including some of the employees.

00:11:57.511 --> 00:11:58.784
MG: That's what I said, the employees,

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.906
it went away for them three
months after you were there.

00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:03.226
BG: No, I'm kidding.
MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.

00:12:03.226 --> 00:12:05.127
BG: A few of them did, but —

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:06.960
(Laughter)

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.903
CA: So what do you guys argue about?

00:12:08.903 --> 00:12:11.560
Sunday, 11 o'clock,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.981
you're away from work,

00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:15.494
what comes up? What's the argument?

00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:17.139
BG: Because we built this thing

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:20.258
together from the beginning,

00:12:20.258 --> 00:12:21.904
it's this great partnership.

00:12:21.904 --> 00:12:23.758
I had that with Paul Allen

00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:25.669
in the early days of Microsoft.

00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:28.481
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.485
and now Melinda, and in even stronger,

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:33.371
equal ways, is the partner,

00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.128
so we talk a lot about

00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:37.256
which things should we give more to,

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.800
which groups are working well?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.053
She's got a lot of insight.

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:42.700
She'll sit down with the employees a lot.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.816
We'll take the different trips she described.

00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:48.433
So there's a lot of collaboration.

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:50.409
I can't think of anything where one of us

00:12:50.409 --> 00:12:53.679
had a super strong opinion

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:55.515
about one thing or another?

00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:58.317
CA: How about you, Melinda, 
though? Can you? (Laughter)

00:12:58.317 --> 00:12:59.533
You never know.

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:01.059
MG: Well, here's the thing.

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:02.798
We come at things from different angles,

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:04.730
and I actually think that's really good.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.738
So Bill can look at the big data

00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:09.750
and say, "I want to act based
on these global statistics."

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.616
For me, I come at it from intuition.

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.549
I meet with lots of people on the ground

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:15.529
and Bill's taught me to take that

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:18.152
and read up to the global data and see if they match,

00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:19.241
and I think what I've taught him

00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:20.669
is to take that data

00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:22.283
and meet with people on the ground to understand,

00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:24.667
can you actually deliver that vaccine?

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.868
Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops

00:13:27.868 --> 00:13:29.198
in her child's mouth?

00:13:29.198 --> 00:13:30.756
Because the delivery piece

00:13:30.756 --> 00:13:32.959
is every bit as important as the science.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.481
So I think it's been more a coming to over time

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.776
towards each other's point of view,

00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:40.046
and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:42.319
CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:46.118
you've had some amazing successes.

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:47.350
What about failure, though?

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.041
Can you talk about a failure

00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.137
and maybe what you've learned from it?

00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:53.705
BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,

00:13:53.705 --> 00:13:55.842
because we've certainly had them.

00:13:55.842 --> 00:14:00.216
We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work

00:14:00.216 --> 00:14:03.492
that you know you're going to have different failures.

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.719
Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:07.020
was asking for a better condom.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.514
Well, we got hundreds of ideas.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.708
Maybe a few of those will work out.

00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:15.087
We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:17.703
for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,

00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:19.354
that I thought, once I got this drug,

00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:20.710
we can just go wipe out the disease.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.290
Well, turns out it took an injection

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.926
every day for 10 days.

00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:27.313
It took three more years to get it than we expected,

00:14:27.313 --> 00:14:28.771
and then there was no way

00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:31.139
it was going to get out there.

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:32.358
Fortunately, we found out

00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:35.520
that if you go kill the sand flies,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.642
you probably can have success there,

00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:39.497
but we spent five years,

00:14:39.497 --> 00:14:40.875
you could say wasted five years,

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.882
and about 60 million,

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.222
on a path that turned out to have

00:14:44.222 --> 00:14:48.387
very modest benefit when we got there.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:51.831
CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year

00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:53.766
in education, I think, something like that.

00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:57.790
Is anything, the story of what's gone right there

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.246
is quite a long and complex one.

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:04.168
Are there any failures that you can talk about?

00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:05.958
MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.206
out of the early work is we thought

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:09.739
that these small schools were the answer,

00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:11.209
and small schools definitely help.

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:12.733
They bring down the dropout rate.

00:15:12.733 --> 00:15:15.333
They have less violence and crime in those schools.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.479
But the thing that we learned from that work,

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:20.013
and what turned out to be the fundamental key,

00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:22.077
is a great teacher in front of the classroom.

00:15:22.077 --> 00:15:23.684
If you don't have an effective teacher

00:15:23.684 --> 00:15:24.750
in the front of the classroom,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.906
I don't care how big or small the building is,

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:28.560
you're not going to change the trajectory

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.513
of whether that student will be ready for college.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:35.108
(Applause)

00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:37.418
CA: So Melinda, this is you and

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:40.972
your eldest daughter, Jenn.

00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:42.871
And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,

00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:44.455
three or four weeks ago. Where was this?

00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.211
MG: So we went to Tanzania.

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:47.053
Jenn's been to Tanzania.

00:15:47.053 --> 00:15:49.756
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.

00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:51.971
And we did something very different,

00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:53.798
which is, we decided to go spend

00:15:53.798 --> 00:15:56.217
two nights and three days with a family.

00:15:56.217 --> 00:15:59.318
Anna and Sanare are the parents.

00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:02.352
They invited us to come and stay in their boma.

00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:03.851
Actually, the goats had been there, I think,

00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:05.250
living in that particular little hut

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.921
on their little compound before we got there.

00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:09.419
And we stayed with their family,

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:11.353
and we really, really learned

00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:13.206
what life is like in rural Tanzania.

00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:14.820
And the difference between just going

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.539
and visiting for half a day

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:18.001
or three quarters of a day

00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:20.399
versus staying overnight was profound,

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.890
and so let me just give you one explanation of that.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.019
They had six children, and as I talked to Anna

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.794
in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours

00:16:27.794 --> 00:16:29.437
in the cooking hut that day,

00:16:29.437 --> 00:16:31.248
and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:32.718
and spaced with her husband

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.155
the births of their children.

00:16:34.155 --> 00:16:35.810
It was a very loving relationship.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.113
This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,

00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:40.022
but they had decided to get married,

00:16:40.022 --> 00:16:43.357
they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.

00:16:43.357 --> 00:16:44.968
Their children, their six children,

00:16:44.968 --> 00:16:47.487
the two in the middle were twins, 13,

00:16:47.487 --> 00:16:49.740
a boy, and a girl named Grace.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.313
And when we'd go out to chop wood

00:16:51.313 --> 00:16:53.748
and do all the things that Grace
and her mother would do,

00:16:53.748 --> 00:16:56.340
Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.817
but she wasn't an adult.

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:59.568
She was very, very shy.

00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:01.329
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:04.164
We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.

00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:05.770
And at night, though,

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.577
when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,

00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:10.081
and there was no moon that night,

00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:11.803
the first night, and no stars,

00:17:11.803 --> 00:17:13.629
and Jenn came out of our hut

00:17:13.629 --> 00:17:16.446
with her REI little headlamp on,

00:17:16.446 --> 00:17:18.584
Grace went immediately,

00:17:18.584 --> 00:17:19.940
and got the translator,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.030
came straight up to my Jenn and said,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.263
"When you go home,

00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:24.438
can I have your headlamp

00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:26.168
so I can study at night?"

00:17:26.168 --> 00:17:27.250
CA: Oh, wow.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.734
MG: And her dad had told me

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.821
how afraid he was that unlike the son,

00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:32.483
who had passed his secondary exams,

00:17:32.483 --> 00:17:34.013
because of her chores,

00:17:34.013 --> 00:17:35.451
she'd not done so well

00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:37.255
and wasn't in the government school yet.

00:17:37.255 --> 00:17:39.790
He said, "I don't know how I'm
going to pay for her education.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.616
I can't pay for private school,

00:17:41.616 --> 00:17:44.195
and she may end up on this farm like my wife."

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:45.324
So they know the difference

00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:46.349
that an education can make

00:17:46.349 --> 00:17:49.346
in a huge, profound way.

00:17:49.346 --> 00:17:50.767
CA: I mean, this is another pic

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:54.173
of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:58.311
along with Paul Farmer.

00:17:58.311 --> 00:17:59.925
Bringing up three children

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:02.927
when you're the world's richest family

00:18:02.927 --> 00:18:05.223
seems like a social experiment

00:18:05.223 --> 00:18:08.795
without much prior art.

00:18:08.795 --> 00:18:10.330
How have you managed it?

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.545
What's been your approach?

00:18:12.545 --> 00:18:15.178
BG: Well, I'd say overall

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.940
the kids get a great education,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.838
but you've got to make sure

00:18:17.838 --> 00:18:19.540
they have a sense of their own ability

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.529
and what they're going to go and do,

00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:23.902
and our philosophy has been

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.124
to be very clear with them --

00:18:25.124 --> 00:18:26.669
most of the money's going to the foundation --

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:31.010
and help them find something they're excited about.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.405
We want to strike a balance where they have

00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:34.198
the freedom to do anything

00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:37.538
but not a lot of money showered on them

00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:40.667
so they could go out and do nothing.

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:43.645
And so far, they're fairly diligent,

00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:46.853
excited to pick their own direction.

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:52.421
CA: You've obviously guarded their 
privacy carefully for obvious reasons.

00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:54.615
I'm curious why you've given me permission

00:18:54.615 --> 00:18:56.240
to show this picture now here at TED.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.377
MG: Well, it's interesting.

00:18:57.377 --> 00:18:59.218
As they get older, they so know

00:18:59.218 --> 00:19:02.227
that our family belief is about responsibility,

00:19:02.227 --> 00:19:04.342
that we are in an unbelievable situation

00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:05.960
just to live in the United States

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.651
and have a great education,

00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:09.699
and we have a responsibility
to give back to the world.

00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:10.752
And so as they get older

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:11.772
and we are teaching them --

00:19:11.772 --> 00:19:14.132
they have been to so many
countries around the world —

00:19:14.132 --> 00:19:15.264
they're saying,

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:17.016
we do want people to know that we believe

00:19:17.016 --> 00:19:18.517
in what you're doing, Mom and Dad,

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:20.478
and it is okay to show us more.

00:19:20.478 --> 00:19:23.130
So we have their permission to show this picture,

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.845
and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it

00:19:24.845 --> 00:19:27.300
eventually in some of his work.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.902
But they really care deeply

00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:31.327
about the mission of the foundation, too.

00:19:31.327 --> 00:19:33.249
CA: You've easily got enough money

00:19:33.249 --> 00:19:35.840
despite your vast contributions to the foundation

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.474
to make them all billionaires.

00:19:37.474 --> 00:19:38.991
Is that your plan for them?

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:41.327
BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.

00:19:41.327 --> 00:19:43.262
They need to have a sense

00:19:43.262 --> 00:19:49.798
that their own work is meaningful and important.

00:19:49.798 --> 00:19:53.270
We read an article long, actually,
before we got married,

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.915
where Warren Buffett talked about that,

00:19:55.915 --> 00:19:58.164
and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor

00:19:58.164 --> 00:20:01.418
either to society or to the kids.

00:20:01.418 --> 00:20:03.486
CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,

00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:06.150
something really amazing happened in 2006,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.110
when somehow your only real rival

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.662
for richest person in America

00:20:10.662 --> 00:20:12.032
suddenly turned around and agreed to give

00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:14.625
80 percent of his fortune

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:16.342
to your foundation.

00:20:16.342 --> 00:20:18.078
How on Earth did that happen?

00:20:18.078 --> 00:20:20.056
I guess there's a long version
and a short version of that.

00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:21.438
We've got time for the short version.

00:20:21.438 --> 00:20:25.193
BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,

00:20:25.193 --> 00:20:29.850
and he was going to have his wife Suzie

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.405
give it all away.

00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:34.846
Tragically, she passed away before he did,

00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:38.444
and he's big on delegation, and

00:20:38.444 --> 00:20:40.602
— (Laughter) —

00:20:40.602 --> 00:20:42.013
he said —

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:42.868
CA: Tweet that.

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:46.029
BG: If he's got somebody
who is doing something well,

00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:50.486
and is willing to do it at no charge,

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:52.864
maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.

00:20:52.864 --> 00:20:54.960
MG: Totally stunned.
BG: We had never expected it,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.525
and it has been unbelievable.

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:59.665
It's allowed us to increase our ambition

00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:03.282
in what the foundation can do quite dramatically.

00:21:03.282 --> 00:21:04.786
Half the resources we have

00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:07.670
come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.554
CA: And I think you've pledged that

00:21:08.554 --> 00:21:10.344
by the time you're done,

00:21:10.344 --> 00:21:12.222
more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,

00:21:12.222 --> 00:21:14.117
will be given to the foundation.

00:21:14.117 --> 00:21:15.271
BG: Yes.

00:21:15.271 --> 00:21:19.020
CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.386
(Applause)

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:25.023
And recently, you and Warren

00:21:25.023 --> 00:21:26.903
have been going around trying to persuade

00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:28.879
other billionaires and successful people

00:21:28.879 --> 00:21:30.402
to pledge to give, what,

00:21:30.402 --> 00:21:36.160
more than half of their assets for philanthropy.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.575
How is that going?

00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:41.747
BG: Well, we've got about 120 people

00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:44.185
who have now taken this giving pledge.

00:21:44.185 --> 00:21:46.791
The thing that's great is that we get together

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.900
yearly and talk about, okay,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.865
do you hire staff, what do you give to them?

00:21:50.865 --> 00:21:52.092
We're not trying to homogenize it.

00:21:52.092 --> 00:21:53.140
I mean, the beauty of philanthropy

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.147
is this mind-blowing diversity.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.310
People give to some things.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.989
We look and go, "Wow."

00:21:58.989 --> 00:22:00.097
But that's great.

00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:01.226
That's the role of philanthropy

00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:03.713
is to pick different approaches,

00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:05.705
including even in one space, like education.

00:22:05.705 --> 00:22:08.076
We need more experimentation.

00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:10.980
But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.212
sharing their journey to philanthropy,

00:22:13.212 --> 00:22:14.316
how they involve their kids,

00:22:14.316 --> 00:22:16.150
where they're doing it differently,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.856
and it's been way more successful than we expected.

00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:21.551
Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size

00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:24.114
in the years ahead.

00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:27.626
MG: And having people see that other people

00:22:27.626 --> 00:22:29.330
are making change with philanthropy,

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.666
I mean, these are people who have

00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:32.711
created their own businesses,

00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:35.359
put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:37.585
If they put their ideas and their brain

00:22:37.585 --> 00:22:40.118
behind philanthropy, they can change the world.

00:22:40.118 --> 00:22:42.409
And they start to see others doing it, and saying,

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:44.449
"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."

00:22:44.449 --> 00:22:46.493
To me, that's the piece that's incredible.

00:22:46.493 --> 00:22:49.411
CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard

00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:50.657
for some people to figure out

00:22:50.657 --> 00:22:53.340
even how to remotely spend that much money

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.513
on something else.

00:22:55.513 --> 00:22:57.606
There are probably some billionaires in the room

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:59.715
and certainly some successful people.

00:22:59.715 --> 00:23:01.775
I'm curious, can you make the pitch?

00:23:01.775 --> 00:23:03.009
What's the pitch?

00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:04.390
BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.872
we've ever done,

00:23:05.872 --> 00:23:08.842
and you can't take it with you,

00:23:08.842 --> 00:23:12.024
and if it's not good for your kids,

00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:13.313
let's get together and brainstorm

00:23:13.313 --> 00:23:16.000
about what we can be done.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.190
The world is a far better place

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.828
because of the philanthropists of the past,

00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:23.861
and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,

00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.212
is the envy of the world.

00:23:25.212 --> 00:23:27.130
And part of the reason I'm so optimistic

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.074
is because I do think philanthropy

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.688
is going to grow

00:23:30.688 --> 00:23:31.807
and take some of these things

00:23:31.807 --> 00:23:34.706
government's not just good at
working on and discovering

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:38.176
and shine some light in the right direction.

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:41.118
CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,

00:23:41.118 --> 00:23:42.279
growing inequality problem

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:43.740
that seems structural.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.606
It does seem to me that if more of your peers

00:23:46.606 --> 00:23:48.982
took the approach that you two have made,

00:23:48.982 --> 00:23:50.574
it would make a dent

00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:51.840
both in that problem and certainly

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.440
in the perception of that problem.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.844
Is that a fair comment?

00:23:54.844 --> 00:23:56.502
BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:59.834
and give to the least wealthy, it's good.

00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:01.966
It tries to balance out, and that's just.

00:24:01.966 --> 00:24:03.722
MG: But you change systems.

00:24:03.722 --> 00:24:06.335
In the U.S., we're trying to
change the education system

00:24:06.335 --> 00:24:08.403
so it's just for everybody

00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:09.960
and it works for all students.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.850
That, to me, really changes

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.007
the inequality balance.

00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:14.589
BG: That's the most important.

00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:18.137
(Applause)

00:24:18.137 --> 00:24:21.552
CA: Well, I really think that most people here

00:24:21.552 --> 00:24:23.297
and many millions around the world

00:24:23.297 --> 00:24:25.846
are just in awe of the trajectory

00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:27.154
your lives have taken

00:24:27.154 --> 00:24:30.885
and the spectacular degree to which

00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:33.000
you have shaped the future.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.340
Thank you so much for coming to TED

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.801
and for sharing with us and for all you do.

00:24:35.801 --> 00:24:37.737
BG: Thank you.
MG: Thank you.

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:40.524
(Applause)

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:50.910
BG: Thank you.
MG: Thank you very much.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.081
BG: All right, good job. (Applause)
