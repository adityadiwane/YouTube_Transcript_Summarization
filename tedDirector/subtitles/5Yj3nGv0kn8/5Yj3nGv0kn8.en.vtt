00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:13.820
Today I want to tell you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.623
about a project being carried out

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:18.310
by scientists all over the world

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.598
to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:23.770
And the central idea of this work

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.628
is that the human mind and brain

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:28.485
is not a single, general-purpose processor,

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.927
but a collection of highly specialized components,

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:34.910
each solving a different specific problem,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.246
and yet collectively making up

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:41.602
who we are as human beings and thinkers.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.078
To give you a feel for this idea,

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:45.742
imagine the following scenario:

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:47.938
You walk into your child's day care center.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.175
As usual, there's a dozen kids there

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.766
waiting to get picked up,

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.398
but this time,

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.383
the children's faces look weirdly similar,

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:59.191
and you can't figure out which child is yours.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.940
Do you need new glasses?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.848
Are you losing your mind?

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:05.300
You run through a quick mental checklist.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.194
No, you seem to be thinking clearly,

00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:09.585
and your vision is perfectly sharp.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.374
And everything looks normal

00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:13.536
except the children's faces.

00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:15.322
You can see the faces,

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.030
but they don't look distinctive,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.888
and none of them looks familiar,

00:01:18.888 --> 00:01:21.386
and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:23.282
that you find your daughter.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.707
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:28.253
actually happens to people.

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:30.307
It's called prosopagnosia,

00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:31.488
and it results from damage

00:01:31.488 --> 00:01:33.614
to a particular part of the brain.

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.114
The striking thing about it

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:37.709
is that only face recognition is impaired;

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.148
everything else is just fine.

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:44.016
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:48.551
mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:49.914
These syndromes collectively

00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:52.153
have suggested for a long time

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:55.921
that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.306
but the effort to discover those components

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.920
has jumped to warp speed

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.502
with the invention of brain imaging technology,

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:05.550
especially MRI.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.790
So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.376
at high resolution,

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:11.806
so I'm going to show you in a second

00:02:11.806 --> 00:02:15.158
a set of MRI cross-sectional images

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:16.776
through a familiar object,

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:17.651
and we're going to fly through them

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.124
and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:22.235
Here we go.

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.130
It's not that easy. It's an artichoke.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.760
Okay, let's try another one,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.356
starting from the bottom and going through the top.

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:33.963
Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.

00:02:33.963 --> 00:02:35.627
Isn't it beautiful? I love that.

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:38.384
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:39.970
In fact, it's my brain.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.703
We're going through slices through my head like that.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.461
That's my nose over on the right, and now

00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.870
we're going over here, right there.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.471
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.383
but it shows only anatomy.

00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:55.903
The really cool advance with functional imaging

00:02:55.903 --> 00:02:57.475
happened when scientists figured out how to make

00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:00.870
pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.305
that is, where neurons are firing.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:04.821
So here's how this works.

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:05.938
Brains are like muscles.

00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:07.501
When they get active,

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:10.475
they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:14.043
and lucky for us, blood flow
control to the brain is local,

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.205
so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:17.705
get active and start firing,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.430
then blood flow increases just right there.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.151
So functional MRI picks up
on that blood flow increase,

00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.184
producing a higher MRI response

00:03:26.184 --> 00:03:29.110
where neural activity goes up.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.810
So to give you a concrete feel

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.295
for how a functional MRI experiment goes

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:34.734
and what you can learn from it

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:36.118
and what you can't,

00:03:36.118 --> 00:03:39.560
let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.698
We wanted to know if there was a special
part of the brain for recognizing faces,

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:46.770
and there was already reason to
think there might be such a thing

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.490
based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.613
that I described a moment ago,

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.891
but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain

00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.810
in a normal person,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.866
so we set out to look for it.

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:58.817
So I was the first subject.

00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:01.029
I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.612
I held my head as still as I could

00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:08.629
while staring at pictures of faces like these

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.760
and objects like these

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.925
and faces and objects for hours.

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.697
So as somebody who has
pretty close to the world record

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:22.240
of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.672
I can tell you that one of the skills

00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:26.335
that's really important for MRI research

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.113
is bladder control.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:29.915
(Laughter)

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:31.452
When I got out of the scanner,

00:04:31.452 --> 00:04:33.768
I did a quick analysis of the data,

00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:35.271
looking for any parts of my brain

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.077
that produced a higher response
when I was looking at faces

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.947
than when I was looking at objects,

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.118
and here's what I saw.

00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:45.774
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,

00:04:45.774 --> 00:04:48.582
but at the time I thought it was beautiful.

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:50.532
What it shows is that region right there,

00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:51.815
that little blob,

00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:53.562
it's about the size of an olive

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:55.718
and it's on the bottom surface of my brain

00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:58.924
about an inch straight in from right there.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.714
And what that part of my brain is doing

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:04.634
is producing a higher MRI response,

00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:06.382
that is, higher neural activity,

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:07.864
when I was looking at faces

00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:10.130
than when I was looking at objects.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.490
So that's pretty cool,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.808
but how do we know this isn't a fluke?

00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:15.228
Well, the easiest way

00:05:15.228 --> 00:05:17.342
is to just do the experiment again.

00:05:17.342 --> 00:05:18.981
So I got back in the scanner,

00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:21.412
I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.601
and I got a similar blob,

00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:25.496
and then I did it again

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.351
and I did it again

00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:30.423
and again and again,

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:31.470
and around about then

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.411
I decided to believe it was for real.

00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:38.164
But still, maybe this is
something weird about my brain

00:05:38.164 --> 00:05:40.626
and no one else has one of these things in there,

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:43.081
so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.527
and found that pretty much everyone

00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:47.533
has that little face-processing region

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:50.426
in a similar neighborhood of the brain.

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:52.314
So the next question was,

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:53.788
what does this thing really do?

00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:57.720
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.960
Well, maybe not, right?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.762
Maybe it responds not only to faces

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:02.871
but to any body part.

00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.240
Maybe it responds to anything human

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.020
or anything alive

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.676
or anything round.

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.830
The only way to be really sure that that region

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.247
is specialized for face recognition

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:15.890
is to rule out all of those hypotheses.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.720
So we spent much of the next couple of years

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.367
scanning subjects while they looked at lots

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:21.973
of different kinds of images,

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:23.930
and we showed that that part of the brain

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.880
responds strongly when you look at

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.333
any images that are faces of any kind,

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:31.246
and it responds much less strongly

00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:34.395
to any image you show that isn't a face,

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:35.700
like some of these.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.939
So have we finally nailed the case

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.179
that this region is necessary for face recognition?

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:42.502
No, we haven't.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.453
Brain imaging can never tell you

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:46.893
if a region is necessary for anything.

00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:48.333
All you can do with brain imaging

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.381
is watch regions turn on and off

00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.349
as people think different thoughts.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.960
To tell if a part of the brain is
necessary for a mental function,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.469
you need to mess with it and see what happens,

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.744
and normally we don't get to do that.

00:07:00.744 --> 00:07:03.328
But an amazing opportunity came about

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.792
very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.863
tested this man who has epilepsy

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:11.545
and who is shown here in his hospital bed

00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:12.912
where he's just had electrodes placed

00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:14.983
on the surface of his brain

00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:17.537
to identify the source of his seizures.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.070
So it turned out by total chance

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.019
that two of the electrodes

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.242
happened to be right on top of his face area.

00:07:25.242 --> 00:07:27.571
So with the patient's consent,

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:30.158
the doctors asked him what happened

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:34.324
when they electrically stimulated
that part of his brain.

00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:35.978
Now, the patient doesn't know

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:37.362
where those electrodes are,

00:07:37.362 --> 00:07:39.574
and he's never heard of the face area.

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:41.565
So let's watch what happens.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.534
It's going to start with a control condition

00:07:43.534 --> 00:07:45.941
that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly

00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:47.651
in red in the lower left,

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:49.933
when no current is delivered,

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:53.748
and you'll hear the neurologist speaking
to the patient first. So let's watch.

00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:55.829
(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.114
and tell me what happens when I do this.

00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:00.048
All right?

00:08:00.048 --> 00:08:02.871
Patient: Okay.

00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:07.191
Neurologist: One, two, three.

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.206
Patient: Nothing.
Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:12.613
I'm going to do it one more time.

00:08:12.613 --> 00:08:15.807
Look at my face.

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:20.307
One, two, three.

00:08:20.307 --> 00:08:23.131
Patient: You just turned into somebody else.

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.268
Your face metamorphosed.

00:08:25.268 --> 00:08:28.279
Your nose got saggy, it went to the left.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:31.815
You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.449
but somebody different.

00:08:34.449 --> 00:08:36.521
That was a trip.

00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:39.653
(Laughter)

00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:41.268
Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —

00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:45.491
(Applause) —

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.173
this experiment finally nails the case

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:49.998
that this region of the brain is not only

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:52.135
selectively responsive to faces

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:55.180
but causally involved in face perception.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.310
So I went through all of these details

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.774
about the face region to show you what it takes

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.113
to really establish that a part of the brain

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:05.241
is selectively involved in a specific mental process.

00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:07.400
Next, I'll go through much more quickly

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.060
some of the other specialized regions of the brain

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.160
that we and others have found.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.274
So to do this, I've spent a lot of time

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:16.141
in the scanner over the last month

00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:18.402
so I can show you these things in my brain.

00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:21.635
So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:24.297
So we're oriented like that.
You're looking at my head this way.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.390
Imagine taking the skull off

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.658
and looking at the surface of the brain like that.

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:29.416
Okay, now as you can see,

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:30.919
the surface of the brain is all folded up.

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:32.640
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.074
We want to see the whole thing,

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.386
so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:40.215
Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about

00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:42.442
that responds to images like these.

00:09:42.442 --> 00:09:43.961
To see that, let's turn the brain around

00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:45.980
and look on the inside surface on the bottom,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.285
and there it is, that's my face area.

00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:50.992
Just to the right of that is another region

00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:52.630
that is shown in purple

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.702
that responds when you process color information,

00:09:55.702 --> 00:09:58.393
and near those regions are other regions

00:09:58.393 --> 00:10:00.756
that are involved in perceiving places,

00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:03.594
like right now, I'm seeing
this layout of space around me

00:10:03.594 --> 00:10:05.346
and these regions in green right there

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.620
are really active.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.990
There's another one out on the outside surface again

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.795
where there's a couple more face regions as well.

00:10:11.795 --> 00:10:14.140
Also in this vicinity

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.785
is a region that's selectively involved

00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:17.721
in processing visual motion,

00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.225
like these moving dots here,

00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:21.914
and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,

00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:25.082
and near that is a region that responds

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:27.979
when you look at images of bodies and body parts

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.724
like these, and that region is shown in lime green

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:32.727
at the bottom of the brain.

00:10:32.727 --> 00:10:35.359
Now all these regions I've shown you so far

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:39.791
are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.

00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:41.939
Do we also have specialized brain regions

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:44.752
for other senses, like hearing?

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:47.789
Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,

00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:50.190
here's a region in dark blue

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.536
that we reported just a couple of months ago,

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:54.170
and this region responds strongly

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.599
when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.

00:10:57.599 --> 00:10:59.742
(Sirens)

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.823
(Cello music)

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:03.740
(Doorbell)

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.348
In contrast, that same region
does not respond strongly

00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:08.910
when you hear perfectly familiar sounds

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.272
that don't have a clear pitch, like these.

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:13.741
(Chomping)

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.941
(Drum roll)

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.708
(Toilet flushing)

00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:21.206
Okay. Next to the pitch region

00:11:21.206 --> 00:11:23.680
is another set of regions that
are selectively responsive

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.445
when you hear the sounds of speech.

00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:28.285
Okay, now let's look at these same regions.

00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:30.753
In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:32.226
not identical, but similar —

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.435
and most of the same regions are in here,

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.437
albeit sometimes different in size.

00:11:36.437 --> 00:11:38.451
Now, everything I've shown you so far

00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.477
are regions that are involved in
different aspects of perception,

00:11:41.477 --> 00:11:43.310
vision and hearing.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.970
Do we also have specialized brain regions

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.405
for really fancy, complicated mental processes?

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:49.834
Yes, we do.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:53.223
So here in pink are my language regions.

00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:54.651
So it's been known for a very long time

00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:56.686
that that general vicinity of the brain

00:11:56.686 --> 00:11:58.879
is involved in processing language,

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.611
but we showed very recently

00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.321
that these pink regions

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.526
respond extremely selectively.

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:07.338
They respond when you understand
the meaning of a sentence,

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:10.176
but not when you do other complex mental things,

00:12:10.176 --> 00:12:12.355
like mental arithmetic

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.751
or holding information in memory

00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:17.406
or appreciating the complex structure

00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:19.690
in a piece of music.

00:12:21.664 --> 00:12:24.553
The most amazing region that's been found yet

00:12:24.553 --> 00:12:27.860
is this one right here in turquoise.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.050
This region responds

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.318
when you think about what another person is thinking.

00:12:34.318 --> 00:12:35.962
So that may seem crazy,

00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:39.830
but actually, we humans do this all the time.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.023
You're doing this when you realize

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:43.654
that your partner is going to be worried

00:12:43.654 --> 00:12:46.161
if you don't call home to say you're running late.

00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:49.630
I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.911
when I realize that you guys

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.509
are probably now wondering about

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:56.056
all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,

00:12:56.056 --> 00:12:58.020
and what's up with that?

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.705
Well, I'm wondering about that too,

00:12:59.705 --> 00:13:02.100
and we're running a bunch of
experiments in my lab right now

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.113
to try to find a number of other

00:13:04.113 --> 00:13:06.145
possible specializations in the brain

00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:09.513
for other very specific mental functions.

00:13:09.513 --> 00:13:12.134
But importantly, I don't think we have

00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:13.698
specializations in the brain

00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:16.444
for every important mental function,

00:13:16.444 --> 00:13:19.853
even mental functions that may be critical for survival.

00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:21.955
In fact, a few years ago,

00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:23.072
there was a scientist in my lab

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:24.481
who became quite convinced

00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:26.230
that he'd found a brain region

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.142
for detecting food,

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.060
and it responded really strongly in the scanner

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.788
when people looked at images like this.

00:13:32.788 --> 00:13:35.700
And further, he found a similar response

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.639
in more or less the same location

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:39.640
in 10 out of 12 subjects.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.934
So he was pretty stoked,

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:43.194
and he was running around the lab

00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:45.196
telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"

00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:47.214
with his big discovery.

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:50.236
But then he devised the critical test:

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:53.419
He showed subjects images of food like this

00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:56.160
and compared them to images with very similar

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.970
color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.101
And his region responded the same

00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:04.050
to both sets of images.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.377
So it wasn't a food area,

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:08.148
it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.709
So much for "Oprah."

00:14:12.483 --> 00:14:14.708
But then the question, of course, is,

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:16.834
how do we process all this other stuff

00:14:16.834 --> 00:14:19.804
that we don't have specialized brain regions for?

00:14:19.804 --> 00:14:21.615
Well, I think the answer is that in addition

00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:25.169
to these highly specialized components
that I've been describing,

00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:28.848
we also have a lot of very general-
purpose machinery in our heads

00:14:28.848 --> 00:14:30.342
that enables us to tackle

00:14:30.342 --> 00:14:32.448
whatever problem comes along.

00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:34.503
In fact, we've shown recently that

00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:36.571
these regions here in white

00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:39.982
respond whenever you do any difficult mental task

00:14:39.982 --> 00:14:41.083
at all —

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:44.654
well, of the seven that we've tested.

00:14:44.654 --> 00:14:46.823
So each of the brain regions that I've described

00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:48.129
to you today

00:14:48.129 --> 00:14:50.896
is present in approximately the same location

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.638
in every normal subject.

00:14:52.638 --> 00:14:54.261
I could take any of you,

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.487
pop you in the scanner,

00:14:55.487 --> 00:14:57.772
and find each of those regions in your brain,

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.677
and it would look a lot like my brain,

00:14:59.677 --> 00:15:01.747
although the regions would be slightly different

00:15:01.747 --> 00:15:05.311
in their exact location and in their size.

00:15:05.311 --> 00:15:07.676
What's important to me about this work

00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:10.645
is not the particular locations of these brain regions,

00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:13.232
but the simple fact that we have

00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:15.800
selective, specific components of mind and brain

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.448
in the first place.

00:15:17.448 --> 00:15:19.459
I mean, it could have been otherwise.

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.900
The brain could have been a single,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.395
general-purpose processor,

00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:24.867
more like a kitchen knife

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:26.550
than a Swiss Army knife.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.661
Instead, what brain imaging has delivered

00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:33.507
is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.

00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:35.970
So we have this picture of very general-purpose

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.040
machinery in our heads

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.397
in addition to this surprising array

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:42.832
of very specialized components.

00:15:43.712 --> 00:15:45.865
It's early days in this enterprise.

00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:48.641
We've painted only the first brushstrokes

00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:51.568
in our neural portrait of the human mind.

00:15:51.568 --> 00:15:54.650
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.450
So for example, what does each
of these regions do exactly?

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.592
Why do we need three face areas

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:02.057
and three place areas,

00:16:02.057 --> 00:16:04.925
and what's the division of labor between them?

00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:07.618
Second, how are all these things

00:16:07.618 --> 00:16:09.330
connected in the brain?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.917
With diffusion imaging,

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:13.096
you can trace bundles of neurons

00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:15.671
that connect to different parts of the brain,

00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:17.302
and with this method shown here,

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:20.999
you can trace the connections of
individual neurons in the brain,

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:23.717
potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram

00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:25.783
of the entire human brain.

00:16:25.783 --> 00:16:27.830
Third, how does all of this

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.979
very systematic structure get built,

00:16:30.979 --> 00:16:33.935
both over development in childhood

00:16:33.935 --> 00:16:36.747
and over the evolution of our species?

00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.647
To address questions like that,

00:16:38.647 --> 00:16:40.430
scientists are now scanning

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.587
other species of animals,

00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:47.973
and they're also scanning human infants.

00:16:48.931 --> 00:16:52.582
Many people justify the high
cost of neuroscience research

00:16:52.582 --> 00:16:55.336
by pointing out that it may help us someday

00:16:55.336 --> 00:16:58.793
to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.

00:16:58.793 --> 00:17:00.740
That's a hugely important goal,

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.961
and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,

00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:06.959
but fixing things that are broken in the world

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.760
is not the only thing that's worth doing.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.988
The effort to understand the human mind and brain

00:17:12.988 --> 00:17:15.806
is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment

00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:17.483
of a single disease.

00:17:17.483 --> 00:17:19.520
What could be more thrilling

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.661
than to understand the fundamental mechanisms

00:17:22.661 --> 00:17:24.957
that underlie human experience,

00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:27.883
to understand, in essence, who we are?

00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:31.332
This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest

00:17:31.332 --> 00:17:34.045
of all time.

00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:39.515
(Applause)
