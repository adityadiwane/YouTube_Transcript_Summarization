00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.160
If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
One is what's on the Boston Public Library.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Carved above their door is, "Free to All."

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
It's kind of an inspiring statement,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and I'll go back at the end of this.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
to as many people as want to read it.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.160
that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.160
yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
everything that was ever meant for distribution,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
and that's still being refigured out.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
so we can actually achieve that.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
But I'm going to go over the technological, social

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.160
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
If you wanted to put all of the published works online

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
That's pretty neat.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Then the question is, what do you get?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
You know, is it worth trying to get there?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Do you actually want it online?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.160
And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
that look a whole lot like books in certain ways,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
still very book-like -- on your laptop.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.160
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I like the physical book.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
put them on the Net, and then download,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
print them and bind them, and end up with books again.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And it turns out to not be very hard.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.160
It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
And they actually come out kind of nice looking.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
You can actually get really good-looking books

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
putting books back in people's hands again.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
There are some other bookmobiles running around.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
for competing with the bookstore there.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
It was quite popularly attended.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And kids starting to make their own books,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
So the idea of being able to use this technology

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
but I think it still has its place.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160
And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
sort of world,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
we might have something.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.160
fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
There are some newer technologies for delivering

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
is some of these new little screens that are coming out.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.160
And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.160
So here's one of the beta units and you can --

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:38.160
it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and it turns out that 200 dots per inch

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
We're in good enough shape.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
But how do you go about doing all this scanning?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160
And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160
If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
especially if they're valuable books.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
because you could just buy another one,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
But do things that you love.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
about 300,000 now -- doing very well.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.160
But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
so that it's a cost point that we could afford?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.160
If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
we would have achieved something.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
sort of these auto-page-turning things.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.160
So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
you can go and get the proper intonation.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
as you're going through these libraries.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.160
And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
People seem to love it.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
(Laughter)

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
in languages that you can read.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.160
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.160
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.160
26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.160
But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
And what we've been able to do is get into libraries.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
and libraries are up for having their books scanned.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
which is where we have one these scanning centers,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
We've scanned about 200,000 books.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.160
and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
So all in all, that's going very well.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
into the out-of-print world.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.160
and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
and have the classic thing that you have,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.160
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160
But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
that are starting to participate in this program,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
to try out this model of where does a library stop

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
and where does the bookstore take over.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
and we've got about 250,000 books online,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.160
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.160
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.160
but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
And then, there's business model issues

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160
about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
at least for the out of print and out of copyright,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.160
we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
So how much is there?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
or at least that's the largest archives of published materials

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
we've been able to sort of point at.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.160
and put it online, if you're doing things in volume.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160
This is a fairly heavily litigated area,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
so we've found that there are niches in the music world

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
And we've been starting to make these available by going

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and offering shelf space on the Net.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:07.160
If you give something to a charity or to the public,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
except on the Net, where you can go broke.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.160
If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
you can lose your guitars or your house.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
This doesn't make any sense.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.160
So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
as long as nobody made any money. You could --

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.160
They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.160
up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
We've got a lot of collections now --

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
there are not that many of them.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.160
that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
But half of those were Indian.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
But anyway, it's doable,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
to be out of copyright.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
So we've digitized those and made those available.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
that haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.160
all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
We're not quite a YouTube.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
We tended towards longer-term things

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
which has just been great fun.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
Television comes quite a bit larger.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
24 hours a day.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
We only put one week up,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.160
which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160
sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.160
and being able to compare what happened in the past?

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160
except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.160
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.160
So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and have them up on the Net.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.160
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.160
Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160
But we've worked through some of those,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
but we've still got real problems in Washington.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.160
We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.160
And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.160
which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.160
And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
And we've made a Wayback Machine

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.160
that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
the different versions of it that we have,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.160
this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160
and this is what it looked like at Stanford.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.160
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.160
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.160
which is probably best known for burning,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
is, don't just have one copy.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:33.160
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.160
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.160
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.160
flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
so we're hedging our bets here.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.160
If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
There's a political and social question out of this.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.160
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
There's some large companies that have seen this vision,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
that are doing large-scale digitization,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
but they're locking up the public domain.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.160
The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.160
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.160
How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.160
and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
So universal access to all knowledge --

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.160
I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160
like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
It could be something that we're remembered for,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.160
for millennia, for having achieved.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.160
And as I said before, I'll end with something

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.160
that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
Carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.160
carved above his legacy, "Free to the People."

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.160
Thank you very much.
