00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.330
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
it's something we just kind of learned for this,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.330
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.330
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Nice show. Man, that was good!

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.330
DH: Thank you.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
You actually just did that. (Laughter)

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.330
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
DH: All right, let's show them something special.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
he has invented and working on.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.330
right after I saw another juggler do it.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.330
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.330
(Laughter)

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
(Applause)

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.330
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
but it certainly slows it down.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.330
BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
BF: Oh, Daniel.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
(Applause)

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
DH: One more? (Drum roll)

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Perfect. (Drum roll)

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.330
Perfect. (Drum roll)

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
(Applause)

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.330
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
over three with my right hand. (Drum roll)

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
BF: Also three with his left.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.330
DH: Perfect.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.330
(Laughter)

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.330
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
or should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
BF: First try? Once on purpose?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
(Audience: Once on purpose!)

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
DH: He's looking at me.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Oh, good. All right.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.330
it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.330
with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
And then we thought, "How stupid."

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
BF: I think that's the next session.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.330
DH: Next session?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.330
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.330
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
BF: OK, sorry.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
BF: Sure.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
the things that have happened to me --

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.330
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.330
(Laughter)

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
BF: No, come stay up with him.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.330
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
It's kind of neat. OK.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
(Laughter)

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
DH: Wow, you've been working out.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
BF: No, shut up!

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.330
(Laughter)

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
OK, here we go.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
There you go.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
(Laughter)

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
OK.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
OK, hold on.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
RW: Hmmm.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.330
(Laughter)

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
DH: First one.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
(Laughter)

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.330
(Laughter)

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
What happened there?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
BF: I think we were just outside.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
DH: I don't get it. (Applause)

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
(Laughter)

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.330
DH: One more, one more.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.330
RW: Do I get to hold them?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.330
(Laughter)

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.330
(Laughter)

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.330
(Applause)

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:10.330
(Laughter)

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
(Laughter)

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
Could you just push that?

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
(Applause)

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
DH: Wow! Boy!

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
(Laughter)

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
DH: Let's jump this way, though.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.330
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:03.330
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
(Laughter)

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
DH: True. Barry ...

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.330
DH: Leap over my shoulder.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
BF: Up and over his shoulders.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
(Laughter)

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
Still juggling. (Laughter)

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
Impossible, you say?

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
BF: Incredible, you say?

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
DH: Why bother, you say?

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.330
BF: Here we go.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.330
DH: I think so, that's right.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
Even the pencil.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
BF: He invented the pencil.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
it took us over 10 years to perfect.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.330
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.330
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
Actually, we will take a second to prove --

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
up onto the stage?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.330
(Laughter)

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
BF: Anything?

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.330
DH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter)

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
BF: Over the top, over the top.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.330
BF: Yeah, it's all right.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.330
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.330
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.330
DH: Everything up here's OK?

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.330
BF: Yeah.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
DH: Then here we go.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
point that a little more directly

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.330
into my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.330
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.330
We went too far. (Laughter)

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.330
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
The design of the body is a whole different thing.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
May we have it a bit louder?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.330
(Laughter)

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
BF: We're going on.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
DH: All right, we'll try again.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
DH: Whenever you're ready.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
BF: There we go!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
(Applause)

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:56.330
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
Somebody dance! Come on!

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.330
(Applause)

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
Wow, wow, OK, stop.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter)

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.330
DH: The French judge ...

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.330
BF: One more quick thing.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:22.330
(Laughter)

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
BF: Well, you know ...

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.330
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
that we've won two world juggling championships.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
We're going to show you right now

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
an excerpt from a routine that we used

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
to wipe out the other juggling team competition.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
DH: That's right.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
BF: Good.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
(Laughter)

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.330
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
And look, it has a twin!

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.330
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
DH: There's still one more by my foot.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
What do you want me to do with it?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter)

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:42.330
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
BF: Nice.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
DH: I got that --

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
BF: Nice.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
(Laughter)

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.330
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.330
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
And it's awfully windy over there.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:31.330
Oh, look how it lies there.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
(Laughter)

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.330
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.330
Too much Olympics.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.330
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
What gem of knowledge?

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
What pearl of wisdom?

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
Is that your final answer?

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:14.330
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.330
DH: I do, I do.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
DH: We will juggle seven.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.330
BF: Yes.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
Put your tongue away, Barry.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:42.330
(Applause)

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:50.330
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
Because now, to make this twice as difficult,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.330
we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
BF: Seven-club juggling.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
DH: ... to back.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
BF: Thank you, that's it.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
BF: Thank you guys!

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
DH: Thank you very much!
