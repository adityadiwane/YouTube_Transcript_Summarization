00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.520
There are a few things
that all of us need.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.680
We all need air to breathe.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.696
We need clean water to drink.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.736
We need food to eat.
We need shelter and love.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.920
You know. Love is great, too.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.856
And we all need a safe place to pee.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.656
(Laughter) Yeah?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.616
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly
into the gender binary,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.120
if I could change the world tomorrow

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.056
to make it easier for me to navigate,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.296
the very first thing I would do

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.256
is blink and create single stall,
gender-neutral bathrooms

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.936
in all public places.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.720
(Applause)

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.656
Trans people and trans issues,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.616
they've been getting a lot
of mainstream media attention lately.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.376
And this is a great and necessary thing,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.856
but most of that attention
has been focused

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.296
on a very few individuals,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.160
most of whom are kinda rich

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.376
and pretty famous,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.336
and probably don't have to worry that much
anymore about where they're going to pee

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.536
in between classes
at their community college,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.296
or where they're going to get changed
into their gym strip

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.696
at their public high school.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.376
Fame and money insulates
these television star trans people

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.256
from most of the everyday challenges

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.560
that the rest of us
have to tackle on a daily basis.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.680
Public bathrooms.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.080
They've been a problem for me
since as far back as I can remember,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.416
first when I was just a little baby tomboy

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.136
and then later as a masculine-appearing,
predominantly estrogen-based organism.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.216
(Laughter)

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.136
Now, today as a trans person,
public bathrooms and change rooms

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.520
are where I am most likely
to be questioned or harassed.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.576
I've often been verbally
attacked behind their doors.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.336
I've been hauled out by security guards
with my pants still halfway pulled up.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.736
I've been stared at,
screamed at, whispered about,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.496
and one time I got smacked in the face
by a little old lady's purse

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.096
that from the looks of the shiner
I took home that day

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.896
I am pretty certain contained at least
70 dollars of rolled up small change

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.896
and a large hard candy collection.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560
(Laughter)

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.960
And I know what some of you are thinking,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.320
and you're mostly right.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.640
I can and do just use the men's room
most of the time these days.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.840
But that doesn't solve
my change room dilemmas, does it?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.840
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room
because I'm not a man.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.400
I'm a trans person.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.056
And now we've got
these fearmongering politicians

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.256
that keep trying to pass
these bathroom bills.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.616
Have you heard about these?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.416
They try to legislate
to try and force people like myself

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.136
to use the bathroom
that they deem most appropriate

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.696
according to the gender
I was assigned at birth.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.216
And if these politicians
ever get their way,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.736
in Arizona or California or Florida

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.136
or just last week in Houston, Texas,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.360
or Ottawa,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.680
well then, using the men's room
will not be a legal option for me either.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.595
And every time one of these politicians
brings one of these bills to the table,

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.656
I can't help but wonder, you know,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.216
just who will and exactly how would we
go about enforcing laws like these. Right?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.896
Panty checks?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.576
Really.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.520
Genital inspections outside
of bath change rooms at public pools?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.176
There's no legal
or ethical or plausible way

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.920
to enforce laws like these anyway.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.136
They exist only to foster fear

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.440
and promote transphobia.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.360
They don't make anyone safer.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.920
But they do for sure make the world
more dangerous for some of us.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.856
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.416
They drop out of school,
or they opt out of life altogether.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.376
Trans people, especially trans
and gender-nonconforming youth

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.856
face additional challenges
when accessing pools and gyms,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.576
but also universities,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.360
hospitals, libraries.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.240
Don't even get me started
on how they treat us in airports.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.680
If we don't move now

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.416
to make sure that these places

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.496
are truly open and accessible to everyone,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.800
then we just need to get honest

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.160
and quit calling them public places.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.520
We need to just admit

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.496
that they are really only open for people

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.640
who fit neatly
into one of two gender boxes,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.800
which I do not.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.000
I never have.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.280
And this starts very early.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.560
I know a little girl.
She's the daughter of a friend of mine.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.816
She's a self-identified tomboy.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.936
I'm talking about cowboy boots

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.736
and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks
and bug jars, the whole nine yards.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.216
One time I asked her
what her favorite color was.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.536
She told me, "Camouflage."

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.920
(Laughter)

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.816
So that awesome little kid,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.656
she came home from school last October

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.936
from her half day of preschool

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.016
with soggy pants on because the other kids
at school were harassing her

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.440
when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.296
And the teacher had already instructed her
to stay out of the boys' bathroom.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.856
And she had drank two glasses
of that red juice

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.336
at the Halloween party,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.800
and I mean, who can resist
that red juice, right? It's so good.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.000
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.000
Her and her classmates
were four years old.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.696
They already felt empowered enough

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.920
to police her use
of the so-called public bathrooms.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.736
She was four years old.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.856
She had already been taught
the brutal lesson

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.216
that there was
no bathroom door at preschool

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.440
with a sign on it
that welcomed people like her.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.640
She'd already learned that bathrooms
were going to be a problem,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.640
and that problem started with her

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.040
and was hers alone.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.720
So my friend asked me
to talk to her little daughter,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.760
and I did.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.200
I wanted to tell her

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.266
that me and her mom
were going to march on down

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.216
and talk to that school,
and the problem was going to go away,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.616
but I knew that wasn't true.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.456
I wanted to tell her that it was all
going to get better when she got older,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.680
but I couldn't.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.920
So I asked her to tell me
the story of what had happened,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.360
asked her to tell me how it made her feel.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.920
"Mad and sad,"

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.960
she told me.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.120
So I told her

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.240
that she wasn't alone

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.376
and that it wasn't right
what had happened to her,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.016
and then she asked me
if I had ever peed in my pants before.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.040
I said yes, I had,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.416
but not for a really long time.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.656
(Laughter)

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.016
Which of course was a lie,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.776
because you know
how you hit, like, 42 or 43,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.776
and sometimes you just,
I don't know, you pee a little bit

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.056
when you cough or sneeze,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.256
when you're running upstairs,
or you're stretching.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.816
Don't lie.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.576
It happens. Right?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.776
She doesn't need to know that, I figure.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.696
(Laughter)

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.280
I told her, when you get older,
your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.416
When you get old like me,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.376
you're going to be able
to hold your pee for way longer,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.600
I promised her.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.800
"Until you can get home?"

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.400
she asked me.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.960
I said, "Yes,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.679
until you can get home."

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.840
She seemed to take some comfort in that.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.576
So let's just build some single stall,
gender-neutral bathrooms

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.280
with a little bench for getting changed
into your gym clothes.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.440
We can't change the world overnight

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.616
for our children,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.096
but we can give them
a safe and private place

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.576
to escape that world,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.800
if only for just a minute.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.640
This we can do.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.800
So let's just do it.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.136
And if you are one of those people
who is sitting out there right now

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.176
already coming up with a list of reasons
in your head why this is not a priority,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.336
or it's too expensive,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.976
or telling yourself that giving
a trans person a safe place to pee

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.656
or get changed in

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.576
supports a lifestyle choice
that you feel offends your morality,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.200
or your masculinity,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.256
or your religious beliefs,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.536
then let me just appeal

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.976
to the part of your heart
that probably, hopefully,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.680
does care about
the rest of the population.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.800
If you can't bring yourself
to care enough about people like me,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.216
then what about women and girls

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.776
with body image issues?

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.400
What about anyone
with body image stuff going on?

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.976
What about that boy at school
who is a foot shorter than his classmates,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.856
whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.816
Oh, grade eight,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.016
what a cruel master you can be.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.240
Right?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.000
What about people with anxiety issues?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.536
What about people with disabilities
or who need assistance in there?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.056
What about folks with bodies
who, for whatever reason,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.496
don't fit into the mainstream idea
of what a body should look like?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.616
How many of us still feel shy

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.176
or afraid to disrobe
in front of our peers,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.776
and how many of us allow that fear

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.056
to keep us from something as important

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.200
as physical exercise?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.640
Would all those people not benefit

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.680
from these single stall facilities?

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.960
We can't change
transphobic minds overnight,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.216
but we can give everybody

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.360
a place to get changed in

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.080
so that we can all get to work
