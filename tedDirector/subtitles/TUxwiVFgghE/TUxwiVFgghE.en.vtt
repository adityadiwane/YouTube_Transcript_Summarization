00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Because of what I'm about to say,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I really should establish my green credentials.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
the natural resources of my country,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And I've stuck to that.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
so it's the same now, 30 years later,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.160
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
called Whole Earth Discipline.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
The dominant demographic event of our time

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
is this screamingly rapid urbanization

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
that we have going on.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
and that's mostly in the developing world,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
where that's happening.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
by the size of cities.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
and nine times bigger.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
It's qualitatively different.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
Well we now have a distribution of urban power

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
In other words, the rise of the West,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
dramatic as it was, is over.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
1.3 million people a week coming to town,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
decade after decade.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
What's really going on?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
People are following opportunity into town.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
And this is why.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
and it's because I never lived in one.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
(Laughter)

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Because in town --

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
this is the bustling squatter city

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
of Kibera, near Nairobi --

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
they see action. They see opportunity.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
back in the subsistence farm.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
There is plenty going on.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
The aggregate numbers now

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
are that basically squatters,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
which means they're building the world --

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
personally, one by one, family by family,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
They even build their own infrastructure.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And then gradually gentrifies.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
These people are valuable as a group.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
And that's how they work.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Famine mostly is a rural event now.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
There are things they care about.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
And this is where we can help.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And the nations they're in can help.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And they are helping each other solve these issues.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
You look at that lane on the right.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
The answer is, "Everything."

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
It's much more interactive.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
And the scale is terrific.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
These are people busy getting out of poverty

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
just as fast as they can.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
They're helping each other do it.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
They're doing it through an outlaw thing,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
the informal economy.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Furthermore, people in the informal economy,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
the gray economy --

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
as time goes by,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.160
or they can join the legitimate world.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
We should be able to make that choice

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
There's all kinds of activity.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
In Dharavi the slum performs not only

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
a lot of services for itself,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
but it performs services for the city at large.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
to a private, tiny, unofficial school.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.160
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
So one thing slammed up against another,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
such as in Sao Paulo here.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
is by slamming things together.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
In this case, supply right next to demand.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
that live in this lively part of town on the left

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160
walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Proximity is amazing.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Connectivity between the city and the country

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
is what's going to keep the country good,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
This is what makes cities --

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
(Applause)

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
of subsistence farms, and head to town.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And when they're gone the natural environment

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
starts to come back very rapidly.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
to send food to the new growing markets in town.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
More than half.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Another billion is expected.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
And that will determine a lot of how we function.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Now, for us environmentalists,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
People get into town.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
The immediately have fewer children.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
and the birthrate goes down radically.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Very interesting side effect here,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
here's a slide from Phillip Longman.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
Shows what is happening.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
As we have more and more old people, like me,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
and fewer and fewer babies.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
And they are regionally separated.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
What you're getting is a world which is

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160
old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
in the north.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
doing new things, in the south.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
Where do you think the action is going to be?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
than we think, faster than we think.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
full of runaway positive feedbacks,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Here's just a few samples.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
the surprises are going to be bad ones.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
From your standpoint this means

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
a great increase in climate refugees

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
over the coming decades,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and chaos wars,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
as we're seeing in Darfur.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
That's what drought does.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
It brings carrying capacity down,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
and there's not enough carrying capacity

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
to support the people. And then you're in trouble.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Shift to the power situation.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
or a city planet.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
coal, some gas,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
nuclear and hydro.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
And everyone will keep burning it

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
So with hydro maxed out,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
coal and lose the climate,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
and maybe save the climate.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
And if we can eventually get good solar in space,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
that also could help.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.160
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
in the villages and in the cities.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So, between coal and nuclear,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
compare their waste products.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
the amount of waste that would be added up

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
would fit in a Coke can.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Whereas a coal-burning plant,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
each car having 100 tons.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And it puts 18 thousand tons

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
of carbon dioxide in the air.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
of these various energy forms,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
nuclear is about even with solar and wind,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and ahead of solar --

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
And does nuclear really compete with coal?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Just ask the coal miners in Australia.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
That's where you see some of the source,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
not from my fellow environmentalists,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
Well the good news is that

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
This is good for the atmosphere.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
It's good for their prosperity.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
I want to point out one interesting thing,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
and good things like that.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
might serve even better.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And they're selling these floating reactors,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
25 million watts,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and you compare it to the standard big iron

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160
of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Here's another American design that came out

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
They're typically buried in the ground.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
In terms of proliferation,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
nuclear energy has done more

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
20 percent of electricity

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
in this room is probably nuclear.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And I was glad to see that president Obama

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
when he spoke in Prague the other week.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
in my view, as a biologist,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
have no reason to be controversial.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Despite their best efforts,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
genetically engineered crops are the most

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
which leaves the soil in place,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
getting healthier from year to year --

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
into the atmosphere.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
They reduce pesticide use.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
agricultural area be smaller,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
and therefore more wild area is freed up.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
By the way, this map from 2006

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
is out of date because it shows Africa

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
still under the thumb of Greenpeace,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
and Friends of the Earth from Europe,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
and they're finally getting out from under that.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
This is a moral issue.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
met on this issue twice in great detail

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
and said it is a moral imperative

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
to make genetically engineered crops readily available.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
especially in government circles,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
but it will be on your plate --

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
not this year but pretty soon,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
because some harsh realizations are coming along.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
This is a list of them.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
There will be events,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
which happened a while back.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
Like wars over water,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
such as in the Indus.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
And as those events keep happening

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.160
But there's this little problem with geoengineering:

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
what body is going to decide

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Because everybody is downstream,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
downwind of whatever is done.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And if we just taboo it completely

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
we could lose civilization.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
But if we just say "OK,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
China, you're worried, you go ahead.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.160
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.160
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
I should say, it is more practical than people think.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
This one came from the sulfur dioxide

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
cooled the earth by half a degree.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
That's nothing, compared to all of the other

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
things we may be trying to do about energy.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Just to run by another one:

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
by atomizing seawater;

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
A nice one, because it can happen

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
lots of little ways in lots of little places,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
who made good agricultural soil

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
while it's improving the soil.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
So here is where we are.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
calls our geological era the Anthropocene,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
the human-dominated era. We are stuck

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
with its obligations.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.160
are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
Thank you.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.160
(Applause)
