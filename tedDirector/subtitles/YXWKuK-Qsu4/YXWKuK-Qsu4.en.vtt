00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:18.435
Today 40 million Americans are indebted
for their passage to the new economy.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.143
Too poor to pay their way through college,

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.509
they now owe lenders
more than one trillion US dollars.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.948
They do find what jobs they can get

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:32.457
to pay off a debt
that is secured on their person.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:35.249
In America,

00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:40.804
even a bankrupt gambler
gets a second chance.

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:45.153
But it is nearly impossible

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:48.652
for an American to get discharged
their student loan debts.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:55.141
Once upon a time in America,

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:57.815
going to college did not mean
graduating with debt.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.585
My friend Paul's father
graduated from Colorado State University

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:05.759
on the GI Bill.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.134
For his generation,

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:12.006
higher education was free or almost free,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.427
because it was thought of
as a public good.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:16.872
Not anymore.

00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:22.267
When Paul also graduated
from Colorado State University,

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.664
he paid for his English degree
by working part-time.

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.315
30 years ago,

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:30.006
higher education tuition
was affordable, reasonable,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.426
and what debts you accumulated,
you paid off by graduation date.

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:35.102
Not anymore.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.203
Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps,

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:40.528
but with one difference:

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.044
when she graduated five years ago,

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:44.417
it was with a whopping debt.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.521
Students like Kate have to take on a loan

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.744
because the cost of higher education
has become unaffordable

00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:55.457
for many if not most American families.

00:01:56.427 --> 00:01:57.577
But so what?

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.665
Getting into debt to buy
an expensive education

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.451
is not all bad if you could pay it off

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:06.609
with the increased income
that you earned from it.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:09.379
But that's where the rubber
meets the road.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:17.248
Even a college grad
earned 10 percent more in 2001

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:19.247
than she did in 2013.

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:21.134
So ...

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.438
tuition costs up,

00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:24.985
public funding down,

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.446
family incomes diminished,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.882
personal incomes weak.

00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.646
Is it any wonder that more
than a quarter of those who must

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.677
cannot make their student loan payments?

00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:41.829
The worst of times
can be the best of times,

00:02:41.853 --> 00:02:45.731
because certain truths flash up
in ways that you can't ignore.

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:48.392
I want to speak of three of them today.

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:53.445
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.934
make it abundantly obvious

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.696
that higher education
is a consumer product you can buy.

00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:05.101
All of us talk about education
just as the economists do now,

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:09.606
as an investment that you make
to improve the human stock

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.371
by training them for work.

00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:16.535
As an investment you make
to sort and classify people

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.327
so that employers
can hire them more easily.

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:23.794
The U.S. News &amp; World Report
ranks colleges

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.071
just as the consumer report
rates washing machines.

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:30.858
The language is peppered with barbarisms.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:34.263
Teachers are called "service providers,"

00:03:34.287 --> 00:03:36.040
students are called "consumers."

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.390
Sociology and Shakespeare
and soccer and science,

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.009
all of these are "content."

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:46.699
Student debt is profitable.

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:47.873
Only not on you.

00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.564
Your debt fattens the profit
of the student loan industry.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.477
The two 800-pound gorillas of which --

00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.564
Sallie Mae and Navient --

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:03.794
posted last year a combined profit
of 1.2 billion dollars.

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:07.140
And just like home mortgages,

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.350
student loans can be bundled
and packaged and sliced and diced,

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:11.624
and sold on Wall Street.

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.965
And colleges and universities

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.289
that invest in these securitized loans

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.321
profit twice.

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:21.156
Once from your tuition,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.560
and then again from the interest on debt.

00:04:25.108 --> 00:04:27.474
With all that money to be made,

00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:33.085
are we surprised that some
in the higher education business

00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.181
have begun to engage in false advertising,

00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:36.362
in bait and switch ...

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:42.680
in exploiting the very ignorance
that they pretend to educate?

00:04:44.144 --> 00:04:45.294
Third:

00:04:45.678 --> 00:04:47.067
diplomas are a brand.

00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.092
Many years ago my teacher wrote,

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.657
"When students are treated as consumers,

00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:55.806
they're made prisoners
of addiction and envy."

00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:04.335
Just as consumers can be sold and resold
upgraded versions of an iPhone,

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:07.301
so also people can be sold
more and more education.

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.673
College is the new high school,

00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:12.021
we already say that.

00:05:13.408 --> 00:05:14.807
But why stop there?

00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.308
People can be upsold
on certifications and recertifications,

00:05:18.332 --> 00:05:20.688
master's degrees, doctoral degrees.

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:27.149
Higher education is also marketed
as a status object.

00:05:28.634 --> 00:05:29.785
Buy a degree,

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.996
much like you do a Lexus
of a Louis Vuitton bag,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.814
to distinguish yourself from others.

00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:37.289
So you can be the object
of envy of others.

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.400
Diplomas are a brand.

00:05:41.034 --> 00:05:47.629
But these truths are often times
hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:50.171
There is not a day that goes by

00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:55.232
without some policy guy
on television telling us,

00:05:55.256 --> 00:05:57.280
"A college degree is absolutely essential

00:05:57.304 --> 00:06:00.021
to get on that up escalator
to a middle-class life."

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.568
And the usual evidence offered
is the college premium:

00:06:04.592 --> 00:06:09.839
a college grad who makes on average
56 percent more than a high school grad.

00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:12.473
Let's look at that number more carefully,

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.823
because on the face of it,

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:17.191
it seems to belie the stories we all hear

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:21.603
about college grads
working as baristas and cashiers.

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:27.696
Of 100 people who enroll
in any form of post-secondary education,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.768
45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.858
for a number of reasons,
including financial.

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:36.188
Of the 55 that do graduate,

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:38.260
two will remain unemployed,

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:41.014
and another 18 are underemployed.

00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:45.733
So, college grads earn more
than high school grads,

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:48.750
but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:51.165
and the lost wages while at college?

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.257
Now even economists admit

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:59.511
going to college pays off
for only those who complete it.

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:04.127
But that's only because high school wages
have been cut to the bone,

00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:05.591
for decades now.

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.258
For decades,

00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.639
workers with a high school degree

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:15.766
have been denied a fair share
of what they have produced.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.385
And had they received as they should have,

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.362
then going to college would have been
a bad investment for many.

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:25.512
College premium?

00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:27.695
I think it's a high school discount.

00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:33.092
Two out of three people who enroll
are not going to find an adequate job.

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:36.867
And the future, for them,
doesn't look particularly promising --

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.613
in fact, it's downright bleak.

00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:41.041
And it is they who are going to suffer

00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:45.224
the most punishing forms of student debt.

00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:47.153
And it is they,

00:07:47.177 --> 00:07:48.558
curiously and sadly,

00:07:48.582 --> 00:07:52.391
who are marketed most loudly
about this college premium thing.

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:56.383
That's not just cynical marketing,

00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:57.557
that's cruel.

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:00.427
So what do we do?

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:06.888
What if students and parents treated
higher education as a consumer product?

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.738
Everybody else seems to.

00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:12.948
Then, like any other consumer product,

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:15.471
you would demand to know
what you're paying for.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.710
When you buy medicines,

00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:18.649
you get a list of side effects.

00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:20.785
When you buy a higher educational product,

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:22.443
you should have a warning label

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:24.659
that allows consumers to choose,

00:08:24.683 --> 00:08:26.062
make informed choices.

00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:28.030
When you buy a car,

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:30.665
it tells you how many
miles per gallon to expect.

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:32.634
Who knows what to expect

00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:36.372
from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.465
There is such a thing, by the way.

00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:43.044
What if there was an app for that?

00:08:46.402 --> 00:08:51.270
One that linked up the cost of a major
to the expected income.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.574
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.

00:08:54.598 --> 00:08:56.120
One of you make this.

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.683
(Laughter)

00:08:57.707 --> 00:08:59.439
Discover your reality.

00:08:59.463 --> 00:09:01.772
(Laughter)

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:03.225
There are three advantages,

00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:05.930
three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.

00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:09.121
Any user can figure out

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:12.349
how much money he or she will make
from a given college and major.

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:14.447
Such informed users

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.416
are unlikely to fall victim
to the huckster's ploy,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.850
to the sales pitch.

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:21.580
But also to choose wisely.

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:24.006
Why would anybody pay more for college

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.056
than let's say, 15 percent
of the additional income they earn?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.756
There's a second benefit
to Income-Based Tuition.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.740
By tying the cost to the income,

00:09:34.764 --> 00:09:39.185
college administrators would be forced
to manage costs better,

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:41.549
to find innovative ways to do so.

00:09:41.573 --> 00:09:42.727
For instance,

00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.811
all of you students here pay roughly
the same tuition for every major.

00:09:47.478 --> 00:09:51.525
That is manifestly unfair,
and should change.

00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:56.216
An engineering student uses more resources

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.649
and facilities and labs and faculty

00:09:58.673 --> 00:10:00.351
than a philosophy student.

00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.685
But the philosophy student,
as a consequence,

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.899
is subsidizing the engineering student.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.991
Who then, by the way,
goes on and earns more money.

00:10:09.015 --> 00:10:12.722
Why should two people
buy the same product,

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:13.921
pay the same,

00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:16.722
but one person receive
half or a third of the service.

00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:22.519
In fact, college grads, some majors,

00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:26.163
pay 25 percent of their income
servicing their student debt,

00:10:26.187 --> 00:10:27.860
while others pay five percent.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.026
That kind if inequity would end
when majors are priced more correctly.

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:37.201
Now of course, all this data --

00:10:37.225 --> 00:10:39.299
and one of you is going to do this, right?

00:10:39.323 --> 00:10:41.170
All this data has to be well designed,

00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:43.292
maybe audited by public accounting firms

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:45.268
to avoid statistical lies.

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:47.137
We know about statistics, right?

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:49.989
But be that as it may,

00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:54.394
the third and biggest benefit
of Income-Based Tuition,

00:10:54.418 --> 00:10:59.847
is it would free Americans from the fear
and the fact of financial ruin

00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:02.037
because they bought a defective product.

00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:05.132
Perhaps, in time,

00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:07.404
young and old Americans may rediscover,

00:11:07.428 --> 00:11:09.625
as the gentleman said earlier,

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.688
their curiosity, their love of learning --

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.149
begin to study what they love,

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.352
love what they study,

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:15.759
follow their passion ...

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:19.046
getting stimulated by their intelligence,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.507
follow paths of inquiry
that they really want to.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:27.298
After all, it was Eric and Kevin,

00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:28.490
two years ago,

00:11:29.498 --> 00:11:32.930
just exactly these kinds of young men,

00:11:32.954 --> 00:11:34.976
who prompted me and worked with me,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.561
and still do,

00:11:36.585 --> 00:11:40.271
in the study of indebted
students in America.

00:11:41.272 --> 00:11:42.803
Thank you for your attention.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:47.391
(Applause)
