00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.970
What's one thing that every person
in this room is going to become?

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.171
Older.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.761
And most of us are scared stiff
at the prospect.

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:22.457
How does that word make you feel?

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.110
I used to feel the same way.

00:00:25.648 --> 00:00:27.430
What was I most worried about?

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:30.755
Ending up drooling
in some grim institutional hallway.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.314
And then I learned that only
four percent of older Americans

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.727
are living in nursing homes,

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:37.315
and the percentage is dropping.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.066
What else was I worried about?

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.500
Dementia.

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.669
Turns out that most of us
can think just fine to the end.

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:46.602
Dementia rates are dropping, too.

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:49.531
The real epidemic is anxiety
over memory loss.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:51.415
(Laughter)

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.955
I also figured that old people
were depressed

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.428
because they were old
and they were going to die soon.

00:00:57.452 --> 00:00:59.201
(Laughter)

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.179
It turns out that the longer people live,

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:02.702
the less they fear dying,

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:06.455
and that people are happiest at
the beginnings and the end of their lives.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.476
It's called the U-curve of happiness,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.805
and it's been borne out
by dozens of studies around the world.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.405
You don't have to be a Buddhist
or a billionaire.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.418
The curve is a function of the way
aging itself affects the brain.

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:22.230
So I started feeling a lot better
about getting older,

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:27.155
and I started obsessing about why
so few people know these things.

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:28.825
The reason is ageism:

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.353
discrimination and stereotyping
on the basis of age.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:36.882
We experience it anytime someone assumes
we're too old for something,

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:40.206
instead of finding out who we are
and what we're capable of,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.703
or too young.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.576
Ageism cuts both ways.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.390
All -isms are socially constructed
ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:51.594
and that means we make them up,

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:53.402
and they can change over time.

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:56.947
All these prejudices
pit us against each other

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.113
to maintain the status quo,

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:03.259
like auto workers in the US competing
against auto workers in Mexico

00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:05.866
instead of organizing for better wages.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.779
(Applause)

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:12.194
We know it's not OK to allocate
resources by race or by sex.

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:15.571
Why should it be OK to weigh
the needs of the young against the old?

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:20.043
All prejudice relies on "othering" --
seeing a group of people

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:21.491
as other than ourselves:

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.606
other race, other religion,
other nationality.

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.314
The strange thing about ageism:

00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:29.325
that other is us.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:33.012
Ageism feeds on denial --
our reluctance to acknowledge

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:35.986
that we are going to become
that older person.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.620
It's denial when we try
to pass for younger

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:42.558
or when we believe in anti-aging products,

00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:45.394
or when we feel like our bodies
are betraying us,

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:47.348
simply because they are changing.

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:51.989
Why on earth do we stop celebrating
the ability to adapt and grow

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:53.559
as we move through life?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.164
Why should aging well mean
struggling to look and move

00:02:57.188 --> 00:02:59.272
like younger versions of ourselves?

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:01.820
It's embarrassing
to be called out as older

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.915
until we quit being embarrassed about it,

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.073
and it's not healthy to go through life
dreading our futures.

00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:10.533
The sooner we get off
this hamster wheel of age denial,

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.405
the better off we are.

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:15.539
Stereotypes are always
a mistake, of course,

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.289
but especially when it comes to age,

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:18.650
because the longer we live,

00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:20.818
the more different
from one another we become.

00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:22.219
Right? Think about it.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.969
And yet, we tend to think of everyone
in a retirement home

00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:26.863
as the same age: old --

00:03:26.887 --> 00:03:28.404
(Laughter)

00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:30.858
when they can span four decades.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:33.549
Can you imagine thinking that way
about a group of people

00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:35.715
between the ages of 20 and 60?

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.681
When you get to a party, do you head
for people your own age?

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:42.791
Have you ever grumbled
about entitled millennials?

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.961
Have you ever rejected a haircut
or a relationship or an outing

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.335
because it's not age-appropriate?

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.167
For adults, there's no such thing.

00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:53.638
All these behaviors are ageist.

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:55.333
We all do them,

00:03:55.357 --> 00:03:58.494
and we can't challenge bias
unless we're aware of it.

00:03:58.518 --> 00:03:59.854
Nobody's born ageist,

00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:01.544
but it starts at early childhood,

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:05.018
around the same time attitudes
towards race and gender start to form,

00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:08.474
because negative messages
about late life bombard us

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.850
from the media and popular
culture at every turn.

00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:13.447
Right? Wrinkles are ugly.

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:14.988
Old people are pathetic.

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:16.839
It's sad to be old.

00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:18.254
Look at Hollywood.

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.382
A survey of recent
Best Picture nominations

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:24.179
found that only 12 percent
of speaking or named characters

00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:25.709
were age 60 and up,

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.354
and many of them
were portrayed as impaired.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:30.887
Older people can be
the most ageist of all,

00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.155
because we've had a lifetime
to internalize these messages

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.659
and we've never thought to challenge them.

00:04:36.683 --> 00:04:38.169
I had to acknowledge it

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:39.517
and stop colluding.

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:42.144
"Senior moment" quips, for example:

00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:44.192
I stopped making them when it dawned on me

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:46.334
that when I lost
the car keys in high school,

00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:48.094
I didn't call it a "junior moment."

00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:50.555
(Laughter)

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.706
I stopped blaming
my sore knee on being 64.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.274
My other knee doesn't hurt,

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:56.774
and it's just as old.

00:04:56.798 --> 00:04:58.810
(Laughter)

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:00.127
(Applause)

00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:03.089
We are all worried about
some aspect of getting older,

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:04.701
whether running out of money,

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.102
getting sick, ending up alone,

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:09.589
and those fears are legitimate and real.

00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:11.796
But what never dawns on most of us

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.930
is that the experience of reaching old age

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:16.565
can be better or worse
depending on the culture

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:18.096
in which it takes place.

00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:21.851
It is not having a vagina
that makes life harder for women.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:23.089
It's sexism.

00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:25.008
(Applause)

00:05:25.032 --> 00:05:27.781
It's not loving a man that makes
life harder for gay guys.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:29.104
It's homophobia.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.716
And it is not the passage of time
that makes getting older

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.329
so much harder than it has to be.

00:05:34.353 --> 00:05:35.682
It is ageism.

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:37.288
When labels are hard to read

00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:38.653
or there's no handrail

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:40.337
or we can't open the damn jar,

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.735
we blame ourselves,

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.123
our failure to age successfully,

00:05:44.147 --> 00:05:48.141
instead of the ageism that makes
those natural transitions shameful

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:51.685
and the discrimination that makes
those barriers acceptable.

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.325
You can't make money off satisfaction,

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.027
but shame and fear create markets,

00:05:57.051 --> 00:05:59.559
and capitalism always needs new markets.

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.900
Who says wrinkles are ugly?

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:04.677
The multi-billion-dollar
skin care industry.

00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:08.991
Who says perimenopause and low T
and mild cognitive impairment

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.308
are medical conditions?

00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:12.722
The trillion-dollar
pharmaceutical industry.

00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:13.777
(Cheers)

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:15.931
The more clearly we see
these forces at work,

00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:19.235
the easier it is to come up
with alternative, more positive

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.373
and more accurate narratives.

00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:26.700
Aging is not a problem to be fixed
or a disease to be cured.

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:31.564
It is a natural, powerful,
lifelong process that unites us all.

00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:36.666
Changing the culture is a tall order,
I know that, but culture is fluid.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.005
Look at how much the position
of women has changed in my lifetime

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.554
or the incredible strides
that the gay rights movement

00:06:42.578 --> 00:06:44.640
has made in just a few decades, right?

00:06:44.664 --> 00:06:45.688
(Applause)

00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:47.179
Look at gender.

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:49.860
We used to think of it
as a binary, male or female,

00:06:49.884 --> 00:06:52.050
and now we understand it's a spectrum.

00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:55.668
It is high time to ditch
the old-young binary, too.

00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:58.342
There is no line in the sand
between old and young,

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.318
after which it's all downhill.

00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:02.603
And the longer we wait
to challenge that idea,

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:06.665
the more damage it does
to ourselves and our place in the world,

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.038
like in the workforce,
where age discrimination is rampant.

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:13.911
In Silicon Valley, engineers
are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.263
before key interviews --

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:17.768
and these are skilled
white men in their 30s,

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.264
so imagine the effects
further down the food chain.

00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:22.450
(Laughter)

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:25.845
The personal and economic
consequences are devastating.

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:30.015
Not one stereotype about older workers
holds up under scrutiny.

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:34.117
Companies aren't adaptable and creative
because their employees are young;

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.413
they're adaptable and creative despite it.

00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:38.269
Companies --

00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:39.357
(Laughter)

00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.973
(Applause)

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:45.075
We know that diverse companies
aren't just better places to work;

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.284
they work better.

00:07:46.308 --> 00:07:49.986
And just like race and sex,
age is a criterion for diversity.

00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:52.909
A growing body of fascinating research

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:54.626
shows that attitudes towards aging

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.176
affect how our minds and bodies
function at the cellular level.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.046
When we talk to older people
like this (Speaks more loudly)

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.045
or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" --

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:04.396
it's called elderspeak --

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.423
they appear to instantly age,

00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:08.856
walking and talking less competently.

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:11.687
People with more positive
feelings towards aging

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:12.883
walk faster,

00:08:12.907 --> 00:08:14.494
they do better on memory tests,

00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:17.151
they heal quicker, and they live longer.

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:20.451
Even with brains
full of plaques and tangles,

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:22.455
some people stayed sharp to the end.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:24.649
What did they have in common?

00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:25.979
A sense of purpose.

00:08:26.003 --> 00:08:29.481
And what's the biggest obstacle
to having a sense of purpose in late life?

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:33.623
A culture that tells us that getting older
means shuffling offstage.

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.418
That's why the World Health
Organization is developing

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:38.030
a global anti-ageism initiative

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:41.373
to extend not just
life span but health span.

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:43.903
Women experience the double whammy

00:08:43.927 --> 00:08:45.567
of ageism and sexism,

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.732
so we experience aging differently.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.967
There's a double standard
at work here -- shocker --

00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:52.259
(Laughter)

00:08:52.283 --> 00:08:55.957
the notion that aging enhances men
and devalues women.

00:08:56.457 --> 00:09:00.782
Women reinforce this double standard
when we compete to stay young,

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.457
another punishing and losing proposition.

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.201
Does any woman in this room really believe

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:08.211
that she is a lesser version --

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:11.631
less interesting, less fun in bed,
less valuable --

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:13.646
than the woman she once was?

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.138
This discrimination affects our health,

00:09:16.162 --> 00:09:17.891
our well-being and our income,

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:20.103
and the effects add up over time.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.051
They are further compounded
by race and by class,

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:25.287
which is why, everywhere in the world,

00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:28.014
the poorest of the poor
are old women of color.

00:09:29.308 --> 00:09:31.305
What's the takeaway from that map?

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:33.737
By 2050, one out of five of us,

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:35.507
almost two billion people,

00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:37.553
will be age 60 and up.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.048
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark
of human progress.

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:46.306
All these older people represent a vast
unprecedented and untapped market.

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:51.001
And yet, capitalism and urbanization
have propelled age bias

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:53.064
into every corner of the globe,

00:09:53.088 --> 00:09:55.506
from Switzerland,
where elders fare the best,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.516
to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom
of the Global AgeWatch Index.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.401
Half of the world's countries
aren't mentioned on that list

00:10:03.425 --> 00:10:07.017
because we don't bother to collect data
on millions of people

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:08.725
because they're no longer young.

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.250
Almost two-thirds of people
over 60 around the world

00:10:12.274 --> 00:10:14.849
say they have trouble
accessing healthcare.

00:10:14.873 --> 00:10:18.680
Almost three-quarters say their income
doesn't cover basic services

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:22.461
like food, water, electricity,
and decent housing.

00:10:23.034 --> 00:10:27.065
Is this the world we want our children,
who may well live to be a hundred,

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.350
to inherit?

00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:32.389
Everyone -- all ages,
all genders, all nationalities --

00:10:32.413 --> 00:10:34.625
is old or future-old,

00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:38.514
and unless we put an end to it,
ageism will oppress us all.

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:41.932
And that makes it a perfect target
for collective advocacy.

00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:47.124
Why add another -ism to the list
when so many, racism in particular,

00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:48.936
call out for action?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.193
Here's the thing:

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.987
we don't have to choose.

00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:54.706
When we make the world
a better place to grow old in,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.871
we make it a better place
in which to be from somewhere else,

00:10:57.895 --> 00:10:59.429
to have a disability,

00:10:59.453 --> 00:11:02.557
to be queer, to be non-rich,
to be non-white.

00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:07.506
And when we show up at all ages
for whatever cause matters most to us --

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.255
save the whales, save the democracy --

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.809
we not only make
that effort more effective,

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:15.336
we dismantle ageism in the process.

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:18.173
Longevity is here to stay.

00:11:18.197 --> 00:11:20.708
A movement to end ageism is underway.

00:11:20.732 --> 00:11:23.678
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:27.853
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:28.415 --> 00:11:32.580
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!

00:11:33.027 --> 00:11:35.922
(Applause)
