00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.531
Six thousand miles of road,

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:17.734
600 miles of subway track,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.378
400 miles of bike lanes

00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:21.199
and a half a mile of tram track,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.152
if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:26.486
These are the numbers that make up
the infrastructure of New York City.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:29.105
These are the statistics
of our infrastructure.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.811
They're the kind of numbers you can find
released in reports by city agencies.

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:36.010
For example, the Department
of Transportation will probably tell you

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.791
how many miles of road they maintain.

00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.612
The MTA will boast how many miles
of subway track there are.

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:42.419
Most city agencies give us statistics.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:43.902
This is from a report this year

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:45.794
from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:49.070
where we learn that there's about
13,500 taxis here in New York City.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.360
Pretty interesting, right?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.144
But did you ever think about
where these numbers came from?

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:56.047
Because for these numbers to exist,
someone at the city agency

00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:59.927
had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number
that somebody might want want to know.

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:02.177
Here's a number 
that our citizens want to know.

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:04.007
So they go back to their raw data,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:05.804
they count, they add, they calculate,

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:07.271
and then they put out reports,

00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:09.448
and those reports
will have numbers like this.

00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:11.988
The problem is, how do they know
all of our questions?

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.231
We have lots of questions.

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.571
In fact, in some ways there's literally
an infinite number of questions

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.220
that we can ask about our city.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.695
The agencies can never keep up.

00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:23.751
So the paradigm isn't exactly working,
and I think our policymakers realize that,

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:27.710
because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg
signed into law what he called

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.547
the most ambitious and comprehensive
open data legislation in the country.

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:33.120
In a lot of ways, he's right.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.981
In the last two years, 
the city has released 1,000 datasets

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.591
on our open data portal,

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.355
and it's pretty awesome.

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:41.323
So you go and look at data like this,

00:01:41.323 --> 00:01:43.612
and instead of just counting
the number of cabs,

00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:45.555
we can start to ask different questions.

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:46.755
So I had a question.

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:48.456
When's rush hour in New York City?

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.037
It can be pretty bothersome.
When is rush hour exactly?

00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.662
And I thought to myself,
these cabs aren't just numbers,

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:56.373
these are GPS recorders
driving around in our city streets

00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:58.286
recording each and every ride they take.

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:00.608
There's data there,
and I looked at that data,

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:04.569
and I made a plot of the average speed of
taxis in New York City throughout the day.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.981
You can see that from about midnight
to around 5:18 in the morning,

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:11.544
speed increases, and at that point,
things turn around,

00:02:11.544 --> 00:02:15.506
and they get slower and slower and slower
until about 8:35 in the morning,

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:18.199
when they end up at around
11 and a half miles per hour.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.761
The average taxi is going 11 and a half
miles per hour on our city streets,

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:23.748
and it turns out it stays that way

00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:27.116
for the entire day.

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:28.489
(Laughter)

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.669
So I said to myself, I guess
there's no rush hour in New York City.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.206
There's just a rush day.

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:36.056
Makes sense. And this is important
for a couple of reasons.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.693
If you're a transportation planner,
this might be pretty interesting to know.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:41.668
But if you want to get somewhere quickly,

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:45.136
you now know to set your alarm for
4:45 in the morning and you're all set.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.180
New York, right?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.942
But there's a story behind this data.

00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:50.127
This data wasn't
just available, it turns out.

00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:53.746
It actually came from something called
a Freedom of Information Law Request,

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:54.822
or a FOIL Request.

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:58.288
This is a form you can find on the
Taxi and Limousine Commission website.

00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:01.114
In order to access this data,
you need to go get this form,

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.960
fill it out, and they will notify you,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.090
and a guy named Chris Whong
did exactly that.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.980
Chris went down, and they told him,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.807
"Just bring a brand new hard drive 
down to our office,

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:13.231
leave it here for five hours,
we'll copy the data and you take it back."

00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:15.263
And that's where this data came from.

00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:18.268
Now, Chris is the kind of guy
who wants to make the data public,

00:03:18.268 --> 00:03:22.052
and so it ended up online for all to use,
and that's where this graph came from.

00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:25.570
And the fact that it exists is amazing.
These GPS recorders -- really cool.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.688
But the fact that we have citizens
walking around with hard drives

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:31.270
picking up data from city agencies
to make it public --

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.660
it was already kind of public,
you could get to it,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.472
but it was "public," it wasn't public.

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:37.434
And we can do better than that as a city.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.190
We don't need our citizens
walking around with hard drives.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.527
Now, not every dataset
is behind a FOIL Request.

00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:46.329
Here is a map I made with the most
dangerous intersections in New York City

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.207
based on cyclist accidents.

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:50.146
So the red areas are more dangerous.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.699
And what it shows is first
the East side of Manhattan,

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.310
especially in the lower area of Manhattan,
has more cyclist accidents.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.329
That might make sense

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.225
because there are more cyclists
coming off the bridges there.

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:02.239
But there's other hotspots worth studying.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.908
There's Williamsburg.
There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.

00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:07.760
And this is exactly the kind of data
we need for Vision Zero.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.750
This is exactly what we're looking for.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.885
But there's a story
behind this data as well.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:13.952
This data didn't just appear.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:16.343
How many of you guys know this logo?

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:17.695
Yeah, I see some shakes.

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:20.350
Have you ever tried to copy
and paste data out of a PDF

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.707
and make sense of it?

00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:22.767
I see more shakes.

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:26.112
More of you tried copying and pasting
than knew the logo. I like that.

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:29.622
So what happened is, the data
that you just saw was actually on a PDF.

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.727
In fact, hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of pages of PDF

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:34.886
put out by our very own NYPD,

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:38.038
and in order to access it,
you would either have to copy and paste

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:39.764
for hundreds and hundreds of hours,

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:41.108
or you could be John Krauss.

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:42.151
John Krauss was like,

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.564
I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
I'm going to write a program.

00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:47.852
It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:50.884
and it goes to the NYPD's website
and it would download PDFs.

00:04:50.884 --> 00:04:54.010
Every day it would search;
if it found a PDF, it would download it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.260
and then it would run
some PDF-scraping program,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.596
and out would come the text,

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.161
and it would go on the Internet,
and then people could make maps like that.

00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:04.590
And the fact that the data's here,
the fact that we have access to it --

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.040
Every accident, by the way,
is a row in this table.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.876
You can imagine how many PDFs that is.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:11.083
The fact that we
have access to that is great,

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:13.193
but let's not release it in PDF form,

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.932
because then we're having our citizens
write PDF scrapers.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:18.008
It's not the best use
of our citizens' time,

00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:20.012
and we as a city can do better than that.

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:22.748
Now, the good news is that
the de Blasio administration

00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:25.280
actually recently released this data
a few months ago,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.438
and so now we can
actually have access to it,

00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:29.974
but there's a lot of data
still entombed in PDF.

00:05:29.974 --> 00:05:33.171
For example, our crime data
is still only available in PDF.

00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:36.926
And not just our crime data,
our own city budget.

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:40.655
Our city budget is only readable
right now in PDF form.

00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:42.796
And it's not just us
that can't analyze it --

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:45.751
our own legislators
who vote for the budget

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:47.694
also only get it in PDF.

00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:51.538
So our legislators cannot analyze 
the budget that they are voting for.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:55.146
And I think as a city we can do
a little better than that as well.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.634
Now, there's a lot of data
that's not hidden in PDFs.

00:05:57.634 --> 00:05:59.334
This is an example of a map I made,

00:05:59.334 --> 00:06:02.260
and this is the dirtiest waterways
in New York City.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.769
Now, how do I measure dirty?

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.626
Well, it's kind of a little weird,

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.739
but I looked at the level
of fecal coliform,

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:11.245
which is a measurement of fecal matter
in each of our waterways.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:14.519
The larger the circle,
the dirtier the water,

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:17.876
so the large circles are dirty water,
the small circles are cleaner.

00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:19.520
What you see is inland waterways.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.924
This is all data that was sampled
by the city over the last five years.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.618
And inland waterways are,
in general, dirtier.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.836
That makes sense, right?

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:30.210
And the bigger circles are dirty.
And I learned a few things from this.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.374
Number one: Never swim in anything
that ends in "creek" or "canal."

00:06:33.374 --> 00:06:37.692
But number two: I also found
the dirtiest waterway in New York City,

00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:39.526
by this measure, one measure.

00:06:39.526 --> 00:06:43.174
In Coney Island Creek, which is not
the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:44.332
It's on the other side.

00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:48.210
But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent
of samples taken over the last five years

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.367
have had fecal levels so high

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.460
that it would be against state law
to swim in the water.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.189
And this is not the kind of fact
that you're going to see

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.726
boasted in a city report, right?

00:06:57.726 --> 00:06:59.976
It's not going to be 
the front page on nyc.gov.

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:01.556
You're not going to see it there,

00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:04.074
but the fact that we can get 
to that data is awesome.

00:07:04.074 --> 00:07:05.847
But once again, it wasn't super easy,

00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:08.205
because this data was not
on the open data portal.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:10.218
If you were to go to the open data portal,

00:07:10.218 --> 00:07:12.831
you'd see just a snippet of it, 
a year or a few months.

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:16.221
It was actually on the Department
of Environmental Protection's website.

00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.099
And each one of these links is an Excel 
sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.729
Every heading is different:
you copy, paste, reorganize.

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.681
When you do you can make maps
and that's great, but once again,

00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.650
we can do better than that 
as a city, we can normalize things.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.034
And we're getting there, because
there's this website that Socrata makes

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.575
called the Open Data Portal NYC.

00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:35.832
This is where 1,100 data sets 
that don't suffer

00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:37.613
from the things I just told you live,

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:39.761
and that number is growing,
and that's great.

00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:43.173
You can download data in any format,
be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.

00:07:43.173 --> 00:07:45.720
Whatever you want,
you can download the data that way.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.072
The problem is, once you do,

00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:50.758
you will find that each agency
codes their addresses differently.

00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:52.899
So one is street name, 
intersection street,

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.390
street, borough, address, building,
building address.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.570
So once again, you're spending time,
even when we have this portal,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.176
you're spending time
normalizing our address fields.

00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:03.599
And that's not the best use 
of our citizens' time.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.395
We can do better than that as a city.

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:07.040
We can standardize our addresses,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.225
and if we do, 
we can get more maps like this.

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:11.510
This is a map of fire hydrants
in New York City,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.041
but not just any fire hydrants.

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:17.767
These are the top 250 grossing fire
hydrants in terms of parking tickets.

00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:19.753
(Laughter)

00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:23.111
So I learned a few things from this map,
and I really like this map.

00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:25.513
Number one, just don't park
on the Upper East Side.

00:08:25.513 --> 00:08:29.100
Just don't. It doesn't matter where
you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.253
Number two, I found the two highest
grossing hydrants in all of New York City,

00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:35.139
and they're on the Lower East Side,

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:40.237
and they were bringing in over
55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.

00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:42.975
And that seemed a little strange
to me when I noticed it,

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:46.244
so I did a little digging and it turns out
what you had is a hydrant

00:08:46.244 --> 00:08:48.240
and then something called
a curb extension,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.299
which is like a seven-foot
space to walk on,

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:51.455
and then a parking spot.

00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:53.709
And so these cars came along,
and the hydrant --

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:55.620
"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.094
and there was actually a parking spot
painted there beautifully for them.

00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:02.249
They would park there, and the NYPD
disagreed with this designation

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:03.307
and would ticket them.

00:09:03.307 --> 00:09:05.651
And it wasn't just me 
who found a parking ticket.

00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:07.797
This is the Google 
Street View car driving by

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.414
finding the same parking ticket.

00:09:09.414 --> 00:09:13.918
So I wrote about this on my blog,
on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:14.938
and they said,

00:09:14.938 --> 00:09:18.348
"While the DOT has not received
any complaints about this location,

00:09:18.348 --> 00:09:22.890
we will review the roadway markings
and make any appropriate alterations."

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.849
And I thought to myself,
typical government response,

00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:27.730
all right, moved on with my life.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.700
But then, a few weeks later,
something incredible happened.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.220
They repainted the spot,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.910
and for a second I thought I saw
the future of open data,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.910
because think about what happened here.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.010
For five years, this spot was being 
ticketed, and it was confusing,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.316
and then a citizen found something,
they told the city, and within a few weeks

00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:49.610
the problem was fixed.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.810
It's amazing. And a lot of people
see open data as being a watchdog.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.582
It's not, it's about being a partner.

00:09:54.582 --> 00:09:57.720
We can empower our citizens
to be better partners for government,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.601
and it's not that hard.

00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:01.060
All we need are a few changes.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.167
If you're FOILing data,

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.034
if you're seeing your data 
being FOILed over and over again,

00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:08.608
let's release it to the public, that's
a sign that it should be made public.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.090
And if you're a government agency
releasing a PDF,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.739
let's pass legislation that requires you
to post it with the underlying data,

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.767
because that data
is coming from somewhere.

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:19.249
I don't know where, but it's
coming from somewhere,

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:20.974
and you can release it with the PDF.

00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:23.385
And let's adopt and share
some open data standards.

00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:25.866
Let's start with our addresses
here in New York City.

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:27.940
Let's just start
normalizing our addresses.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.002
Because New York is a leader in open data.

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.791
Despite all this, we are absolutely
a leader in open data,

00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:35.912
and if we start normalizing things,
and set an open data standard,

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:39.546
others will follow. The state will follow,
and maybe the federal government,

00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:40.991
Other countries could follow,

00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:44.402
and we're not that far off from a time
where you could write one program

00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:46.292
and map information from 100 countries.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.779
It's not science fiction.
We're actually quite close.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:51.019
And by the way, who are we
empowering with this?

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:54.024
Because it's not just John Krauss
and it's not just Chris Whong.

00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:57.119
There are hundreds of meetups
going on in New York City right now,

00:10:57.119 --> 00:10:58.144
active meetups.

00:10:58.144 --> 00:11:00.716
There are thousands of people
attending these meetups.

00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:03.084
These people are going after work
and on weekends,

00:11:03.084 --> 00:11:05.720
and they're attending these meetups
to look at open data

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.360
and make our city a better place.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.433
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week 
released something called citygram.nyc

00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:13.580
that allows you to subscribe
to 311 complaints

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.648
around your own home,
or around your office.

00:11:15.648 --> 00:11:18.075
You put in your address,
you get local complaints.

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:21.449
And it's not just the tech community
that are after these things.

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:24.071
It's urban planners like 
the students I teach at Pratt.

00:11:24.071 --> 00:11:25.990
It's policy advocates, it's everyone,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.553
it's citizens from a diverse
set of backgrounds.

00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:31.339
And with some small, incremental changes,

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:34.564
we can unlock the passion
and the ability of our citizens

00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:37.720
to harness open data
and make our city even better,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.346
whether it's one dataset,
or one parking spot at a time.

00:11:41.346 --> 00:11:43.668
Thank you.

00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:46.973
(Applause)
