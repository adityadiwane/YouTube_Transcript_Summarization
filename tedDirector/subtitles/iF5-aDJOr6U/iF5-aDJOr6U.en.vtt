00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.881
Today, I am going to show you

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:19.334
how this tablet and this virtual-reality
headset that I'm wearing

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:23.399
are going to completely
revolutionize science education.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.895
And I'm also going to show you

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.703
how it can make any science teacher
more than twice as effective.

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:34.588
But before I show you
how all of this is possible,

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:40.151
let's talk briefly about why improving
the quality of science education

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.615
is so vitally important.

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:44.674
If you think about it,

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:46.973
the world is growing incredibly fast.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:51.207
And with that growth comes
a whole list of growing challenges,

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:54.244
challenges such as dealing
with global warming,

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:56.631
solving starvation and water shortages

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.107
and curing diseases,

00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:59.656
to name just a few.

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:05.882
And who, exactly, is going to help us
solve all of these great challenges?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, to a very last degree,
it is these young students.

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:14.036
This is the next generation
of young, bright scientists.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.080
And in many ways, we all rely on them

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:19.906
for coming up with new, great innovations

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.641
to help us solve all
these challenges ahead of us.

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.659
And so a couple of years back,

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:31.042
my cofounder and I were teaching
university students just like these,

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:36.180
only the students we were teaching
looked a little bit more like this here.

00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:37.268
(Laughter)

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:40.130
And yes, this is really
the reality out there

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:43.679
in way too many universities
around the world:

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.356
students that are bored, disengaged

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.985
and sometimes not even sure
why they're learning about a topic

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.208
in the first place.

00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:56.097
So we started looking around for new,
innovative teaching methods,

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.944
but what we found was quite disappointing.

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:02.633
We saw that books were being
turned into e-books,

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:06.511
blackboards were being turned
into YouTube videos

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:09.679
and lecture hall monologues
were being turned into MOOCs --

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:12.004
massive online open courses.

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:13.941
And if you think about it,

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.548
all we're really doing here
is taking the same content

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:19.120
and the same format,

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:22.070
and bringing it out to more students --

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:25.403
which is great, don't get me
wrong, that is really great --

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:29.054
but the teaching method
is still more or less the same,

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:31.374
no real innovation there.

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.882
So we started looking elsewhere.

00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:38.533
What we found was that flight simulators
had been proven over and over again

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.024
to be far more effective

00:02:40.048 --> 00:02:45.314
when used in combination with real,
in-flight training to train the pilots.

00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:46.963
And so we thought to ourselves:

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:49.869
Why not just apply that to science?

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:54.444
Why not build a virtual
laboratory simulator?

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:56.811
Well, we did it.

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:58.653
We basically set out to create

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:04.292
a fully simulated, one-to-one,
virtual reality laboratory simulator,

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.513
where the students
could perform experiments

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:08.447
with mathematical equations

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.690
that would simulate what would
happen in a real-world lab.

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:13.393
But not just simple simulations --

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:15.483
we would also create advanced simulations

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:17.431
with top universities like MIT,

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:21.824
to bring out cutting-edge cancer
research to these students.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.403
And suddenly, the universities
could save millions of dollars

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:28.357
by letting the students
perform virtual experiments

00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:31.493
before they go into the real laboratory.

00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:34.835
And not only that; now,
they could also understand --

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.292
even on a molecular level
inside the machine --

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.992
what is happening to the machines.

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:41.915
And then they could suddenly perform

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.567
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.077
For instance also here,

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.713
learning about salmonella bacteria,
which is an important topic

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:53.708
that many schools cannot teach
for good safety reasons.

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.052
And we, of course, quiz the students

00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:58.481
and then give the teachers
a full dashboard,

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:01.431
so they fully understand
where the students are at.

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:03.342
But we didn't stop there,

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:05.691
because we had seen just
how important meaning is

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:08.001
for the students' engagement in the class.

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:09.747
So we brought in game designers

00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:12.652
to create fun and engaging stories.

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.510
For instance, here in this case,

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:18.657
where the students have to solve
a mysterious CSI murder case

00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:21.375
using their core science skills.

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.305
And the feedback we got
when we launched all of this

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.281
was quite overwhelmingly positive.

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.108
Here we have 300 students,

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:32.847
all passionately solving CSI murder cases

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:34.736
while learning core science skills.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.005
And what I love the most about this

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.673
is really when the students
come up to me sometimes afterwards,

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.812
all surprised and a little confused,

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:47.539
and say, "I just spent two hours
in this virtual lab,

00:04:48.432 --> 00:04:50.611
and ... and I didn't check Facebook."

00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:51.964
(Laughter)

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:56.639
That's how engaging and immersive
this really is for the students.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.483
And so, to investigate
whether this really worked,

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:03.910
a learning psychologist
did a study with 160 students --

00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:08.180
that was from Stanford University
and Technical University of Denmark.

00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:11.736
And what they did is split
the students into two groups.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.011
One group would only use
the virtual laboratory simulations,

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:19.735
the other group would only use
traditional teaching methods,

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.674
and they had the same amount of time.

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:23.953
Then, interestingly,

00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:27.644
they gave the students a test
before and after the experiment,

00:05:27.668 --> 00:05:32.021
so they could clearly measure
the learning impact of the students.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:33.213
And what they found

00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:39.038
was a surprisingly high 76 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness

00:05:39.062 --> 00:05:43.906
when using virtual laboratories
over traditional teaching methods.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.834
But even more interestingly,

00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:49.072
the second part of this study investigated

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:52.000
what the teacher's impact
was on the learning.

00:05:52.024 --> 00:05:53.175
And what they found

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.861
was that when you combined
the virtual laboratories

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.489
with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:04.329
then we saw a total 101 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness,

00:06:04.353 --> 00:06:08.785
which effectively doubles
the science teacher's impact

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.167
with the same amount of time spent.

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:16.494
So a couple of months back,

00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:18.031
we started asking ourselves --

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:20.602
we have a wonderful team now
of learning psychologists

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:22.982
and teachers and scientists
and game developers --

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:24.547
and we started asking ourselves:

00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:27.166
How can we keep ourselves to our promise

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.154
of constantly reimagining education?

00:06:30.178 --> 00:06:35.279
And today, I am really excited
to be presenting what we came up with

00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:38.207
and have been working
incredibly hard to create.

00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:42.861
I will explain briefly what this is.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.621
Basically, I take my mobile phone --

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:48.351
most students already
have these, smartphones --

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:52.899
and I plug it into this virtual-reality
headset, a low-cost headset.

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:54.892
And now what I can effectively do is,

00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:58.066
I can literally step
into this virtual world.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.174
We'll have some of you
in the audience also get to try this,

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:04.354
because it is really something
that you have to try

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:06.673
to fully feel how immersive it really is.

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:10.474
It literally feels like I just stepped
inside this virtual lab.

00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:12.001
Do you see me up on the screen?

00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:13.176
Audience: Yes.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.803
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.

00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:17.725
So basically, I have just
turned my mobile phone

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:21.413
into a fully simulated, million-dollar
Ivy League laboratory

00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:24.262
with all this amazing equipment
that I can interact with.

00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:27.659
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette
and do experiments with it.

00:07:27.683 --> 00:07:30.103
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR
and -- oh, look there,

00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:32.648
I have my next-generation
sequencing machine,

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:36.170
and there I even have
my electron microscope.

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:39.624
I mean, who's carrying around
an electron microscope in their pocket?

00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:41.520
And here I have my machine,

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.714
I can do different experiments
on the machine.

00:07:43.738 --> 00:07:45.192
And over here I have the door,

00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:47.584
I can go into other experiments,

00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:49.541
I can perform in the laboratories.

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:51.771
And here, I have my learning tablet.

00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:53.249
This is an intelligent tablet

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:56.121
that allows me to read
about relevant theory.

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:58.447
As you can see, I can interact with it.

00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:02.365
I can watch videos and see
content that is relevant

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:05.254
to the experiment
that I'm performing right now.

00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:07.477
Then over here, I have Marie.

00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.020
She is my teacher --
my lab assistant --

00:08:11.044 --> 00:08:14.221
and what she does is guides me
through this whole laboratory.

00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:15.404
And very soon,

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:18.396
the teachers will be able
to literally teleport themselves

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.979
into this virtual world
that I'm in right now

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:24.233
and help me, guide me,
through this whole experiment.

00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:26.567
And now before I finalize this,

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.559
I want to show you
an even cooler thing, I think --

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.619
something you cannot
even do in real laboratories.

00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:33.881
This is a PCR machine.

00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:36.385
I'm now going to start this experiment.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:40.642
And what I just did is literally
shrunk myself a million times

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:42.225
into the size of a molecule --

00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:44.598
and it really feels like it,
you have to try this.

00:08:44.622 --> 00:08:47.225
So now it feels like
I'm standing inside the machine

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:49.842
and I'm seeing all the DNA,
and I see the molecules.

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:53.469
I see the polymerase
and the enzymes and so forth.

00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:55.096
And I can see how in this case,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.197
DNA is being replicated millions of times,

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:01.054
just like it's happening
inside your body right now.

00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:05.205
And I can really feel and understand
how all of this works.

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:09.513
Now, I hope that gives you
a little bit of a sense

00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:13.663
of the possibilities
in these new teaching methods.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.572
And I want to also emphasize

00:09:17.596 --> 00:09:21.287
that everything you just saw
also works on iPads and laptops

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.482
without the headsets.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:24.870
I say that for a very important reason.

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:28.879
In order for us to really
empower and inspire

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:31.071
the next generation of scientists,

00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:34.619
we really need teachers
to drive the adoption

00:09:34.643 --> 00:09:37.218
of new technologies in the classroom.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:40.420
And so in many ways,

00:09:40.444 --> 00:09:44.799
I believe that the next big,
quantum leap in science education

00:09:44.823 --> 00:09:47.132
lies no longer with the technology,

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:49.037
but rather with the teachers' decision

00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:52.266
to push forward and adopt
these technologies

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.037
inside the classrooms.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.898
And so it is our hope that more
universities and schools and teachers

00:09:57.922 --> 00:10:00.787
will collaborate with technology companies

00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.335
to realize this full potential.

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:06.434
And so,

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:09.291
lastly, I'd like to leave you
with a little story

00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:10.877
that really inspires me.

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.322
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.108
Some of you might already know him.

00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:22.124
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking
low-cost test for pancreatic cancer

00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:24.569
at the age 15.

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.497
And when Jack shares his story
of how he did this huge breakthrough,

00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:33.346
he also explains that one thing
almost prevented him

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.163
from making this breakthrough.

00:10:35.543 --> 00:10:40.603
And that was that he did not
have access to real laboratories,

00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:43.156
because he was too inexperienced

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.621
to be allowed in.

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:48.055
Now, imagine if we could bring

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.348
Ivy League, million-dollar
virtual laboratories

00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:53.443
out to all these students just like Jack,

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:55.074
all over the world,

00:10:55.098 --> 00:10:58.654
and give them the latest, greatest,
most fancy machines you can imagine

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:01.224
that would quite literally
make any scientist in here

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:03.721
jump up and down out of pure excitement.

00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:08.355
And then imagine how that
would empower and inspire

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:12.558
a whole new generation
of young and bright scientists,

00:11:12.582 --> 00:11:15.785
ready to innovate and change the world.

00:11:16.187 --> 00:11:17.338
Thank you very much.

00:11:17.362 --> 00:11:25.425
(Applause)
