00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.762
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:16.051
(Cheering)

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:17.491
Not good enough.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:19.880
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:21.825
(Loud cheering)

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.350
My name is Maysoon Zayid,

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:26.238
and I am not drunk,

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:28.929
but the doctor who delivered me was.

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:32.483
He cut my mom six different times

00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:35.293
in six different directions,

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:37.561
suffocating poor little me in the process.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.553
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:43.355
which means I shake all the time.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.379
Look.

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:47.419
It's exhausting.

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:51.216
I'm like Shakira,
Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.469
(Laughter)

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:56.065
CP is not genetic.

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:59.213
It's not a birth defect.
You can't catch it.

00:00:59.237 --> 00:01:02.411
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.800
and I didn't get it because
my parents are first cousins,

00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:07.148
which they are.

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:11.514
(Laughter)

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.728
It only happens from accidents,

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:15.996
like what happened to me on my birth day.

00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:18.529
Now, I must warn you,

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:19.829
I'm not inspirational.

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:21.473
(Laughter)

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:25.443
And I don't want anyone in this room
to feel bad for me,

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:27.673
because at some point in your life,

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.086
you have dreamt of being disabled.

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:32.443
Come on a journey with me.

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.049
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,

00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:39.365
you're driving around in circles
looking for parking,

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.054
and what do you see?

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.190
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.

00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:46.721
(Laughter)

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.758
And you're like, "God,
can't I just be a little disabled?"

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:55.392
(Laughter)

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.995
Also, I've got to tell you,

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:00.691
I've got 99 problems,
and palsy is just one.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:01.738
(Laughter)

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:04.328
If there was an Oppression Olympics,

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:06.085
I would win the gold medal.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.242
I'm Palestinian, Muslim,

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.590
I'm female, I'm disabled,

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:13.483
and I live in New Jersey.

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:16.454
(Laughter)

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:19.721
(Applause)

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.546
If you don't feel better
about yourself, maybe you should.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.601
(Laughter)

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.952
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:28.549
I have always loved the fact

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:32.583
that my hood and my affliction
share the same initials.

00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:34.045
I also love the fact

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.264
that if I wanted to walk
from my house to New York City, I could.

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:40.316
A lot of people with CP don't walk,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.253
but my parents didn't believe in "can't."

00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:45.448
My father's mantra was,

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:48.528
"You can do it, yes you can can."

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:52.067
(Laughter)

00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.119
So, if my three older sisters
were mopping,

00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:56.310
I was mopping.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.143
If my three older sisters
went to public school,

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.160
my parents would sue the school system

00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:03.407
and guarantee that I went too,

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.197
and if we didn't all get A's,

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:07.349
we all got my mother's slipper.

00:03:07.373 --> 00:03:10.153
(Laughter)

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:13.078
My father taught me how to walk
when I was five years old

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:15.387
by placing my heels on his feet

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:16.721
and just walking.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.043
Another tactic that he used

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.966
is he would dangle
a dollar bill in front of me

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.687
and have me chase it.

00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.035
(Laughter)

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.797
My inner stripper was very strong.

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.410
(Laughter)

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:31.463
Yeah.

00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:33.780
No, by the first day of kindergarten,

00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:35.082
I was walking like a champ

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:37.463
who had been punched one too many times.

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:38.876
(Laughter)

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.396
Growing up, there were
only six Arabs in my town,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.772
and they were all my family.

00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:44.820
(Laughter)

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.927
Now there are 20 Arabs in town,

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:48.769
and they are still all my family.

00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:49.826
(Laughter)

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.555
I don't think anyone
even noticed we weren't Italian.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.550
(Laughter)

00:03:56.574 --> 00:04:00.287
(Applause)

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.002
This was before 9/11

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:05.018
and before politicians
thought it was appropriate

00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:08.477
to use "I hate Muslims"
as a campaign slogan.

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:12.287
The people that I grew up with
had no problem with my faith.

00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.731
They did, however, seem very concerned

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.411
that I would starve
to death during Ramadan.

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:19.586
I would explain to them
that I have enough fat

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.602
to live off of for three whole months,

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:24.972
so fasting from sunrise
to sunset is a piece of cake.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:25.996
(Laughter)

00:04:26.486 --> 00:04:28.665
I have tap-danced on Broadway.

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:31.566
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.669
(Applause)

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:34.811
My parents couldn't
afford physical therapy,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:37.378
so they sent me to dancing school.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.048
I learned how to dance in heels,

00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:40.990
which means I can walk in heels.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.151
And I'm from Jersey,

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:45.188
and we are really concerned
with being chic,

00:04:45.212 --> 00:04:48.487
so if my friends wore heels, so did I.

00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.505
And when my friends went
and spent their summer vacations

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.317
on the Jersey Shore, I did not.

00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:56.555
I spent my summers in a war zone,

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.626
because my parents were afraid

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.524
that if we didn't go back to Palestine
every single summer,

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:04.559
we'd grow up to be Madonna.

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:09.960
(Laughter)

00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:15.049
Summer vacations often consisted
of my father trying to heal me,

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:16.846
so I drank deer's milk,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.888
I had hot cups on my back,

00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:20.873
I was dunked in the Dead Sea,

00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:23.482
and I remember the water burning my eyes

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:25.971
and thinking, "It's working!
It's working!"

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:29.272
(Laughter)

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:32.208
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.971
I have to tell you, it's very boring,

00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:37.450
but before I did yoga,

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:40.121
I was a stand-up comedian
who can't stand up.

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.180
And now I can stand on my head.

00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:48.478
My parents reinforced this notion

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:51.191
that I could do anything,

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:53.206
that no dream was impossible,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.785
and my dream was to be

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.818
on the daytime soap opera
"General Hospital."

00:05:57.842 --> 00:05:59.024
(Laughter)

00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:01.475
I went to college
during affirmative action

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.505
and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.650
Arizona State University,

00:06:05.674 --> 00:06:08.142
because I fit every single quota.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.189
(Laughter)

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:13.382
I was like the pet lemur
of the theater department.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.929
Everybody loved me.

00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:18.042
I did all the less-than-intelligent
kids' homework,

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:19.662
I got A's in all of my classes,

00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:21.563
A's in all of their classes.

00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:23.114
(Laughter)

00:06:23.138 --> 00:06:26.247
Every time I did a scene
from "The Glass Menagerie,"

00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:28.665
my professors would weep.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.913
But I never got cast.

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:32.928
Finally, my senior year,

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:36.862
ASU decided to do a show called
"They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:39.656
It's a play about a girl with CP.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.721
I was a girl with CP.

00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:44.604
So I start shouting from the rooftops,

00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:46.531
"I'm finally going to get a part!

00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:48.364
I have cerebral palsy!

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:50.541
Free at last! Free at last!

00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:52.932
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"

00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:54.960
I didn't get the part.

00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:57.419
(Laughter)

00:06:57.443 --> 00:06:59.562
Sherry Brown got the part.

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:02.551
I went racing to the head
of the theater department

00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:05.020
crying hysterically,
like someone shot my cat,

00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:06.145
to ask her why,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.314
and she said it was because
they didn't think I could do the stunts.

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:13.459
I said, "Excuse me,
if I can't do the stunts,

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:15.040
neither can the character."

00:07:15.064 --> 00:07:19.208
(Laughter)

00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:22.952
(Applause)

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.980
This was a part
that I was literally born to play

00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:32.263
they gave it to a non-palsy actress.

00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:34.942
College was imitating life.

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:37.378
Hollywood has a sordid history

00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:41.395
of casting able-bodied actors
to play disabled onscreen.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.799
Upon graduating, I moved back home,

00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:49.296
and my first acting gig
was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.116
My dream was coming true.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.506
And I knew that I would be promoted

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.029
from "Diner Diner"
to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.311
(Laughter)

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:00.962
But instead, I remained
a glorified piece of furniture

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:03.565
that you could only recognize
from the back of my head,

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.164
and it became clear to me

00:08:05.188 --> 00:08:07.083
that casting directors

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:11.065
didn't hire fluffy,
ethnic, disabled actors.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:13.113
They only hired perfect people.

00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:15.452
But there were exceptions to the rule.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.959
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,

00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:19.895
Roseanne Barr, Ellen,

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.430
and all of these women
had one thing in common:

00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:23.692
they were comedians.

00:08:23.716 --> 00:08:25.542
So I became a comic.

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:28.821
(Laughter)

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:31.834
(Applause)

00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:35.511
My first gig was driving famous comics

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:38.090
from New York City to shows in New Jersey,

00:08:38.114 --> 00:08:41.575
and I'll never forget the face
of the first comic I ever drove

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:45.539
when he realized that he was speeding
down the New Jersey Turnpike

00:08:45.563 --> 00:08:47.736
with a chick with CP driving him.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.761
(Laughter)

00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:51.330
I've performed in clubs all over America,

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:54.882
and I've also performed
in Arabic in the Middle East,

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:57.453
uncensored and uncovered.

00:08:57.477 --> 00:08:58.525
(Laughter)

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:02.266
Some people say I'm the first
stand-up comic in the Arab world.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.447
I never like to claim first,

00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:06.763
but I do know that they never heard

00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:10.653
that nasty little rumor
that women aren't funny,

00:09:10.677 --> 00:09:12.464
and they find us hysterical.

00:09:12.488 --> 00:09:13.939
(Laughter)

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.570
In 2003, my brother
from another mother and father

00:09:19.594 --> 00:09:21.728
Dean Obeidallah and I started

00:09:21.752 --> 00:09:24.096
the New York Arab-American
Comedy Festival,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.070
now in its 10th year.

00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:31.539
Our goal was to change the negative image
of Arab-Americans in media,

00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:34.341
while also reminding casting directors

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:37.106
that South Asian and Arab
are not synonymous.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.135
(Laughter)

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:46.055
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:50.436
than conquering the challenge
against the stigma against disability.

00:09:50.849 --> 00:09:53.172
My big break came in 2010.

00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:56.086
I was invited to be a guest
on the cable news show

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.418
"Countdown with Keith Olbermann."

00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:01.420
I walked in looking
like I was going to the prom,

00:10:01.444 --> 00:10:03.554
and they shuffle me into a studio

00:10:03.578 --> 00:10:07.590
and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.

00:10:07.614 --> 00:10:09.134
(Laughter)

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:10.984
So I looked at the stage manager

00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:14.312
and I'm like, "Excuse me,
can I have another chair?"

00:10:14.336 --> 00:10:16.038
And she looked at me and she went,

00:10:16.062 --> 00:10:18.783
"Five, four, three, two ..."

00:10:18.807 --> 00:10:20.577
And we were live, right?

00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:22.945
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk

00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:26.734
so that I wouldn't roll off
the screen during the segment,

00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:29.593
and when the interview
was over, I was livid.

00:10:29.617 --> 00:10:31.759
I had finally gotten
my chance and I blew it,

00:10:31.783 --> 00:10:34.480
and I knew I would never get invited back.

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:37.972
But not only did Mr. Olbermann
invite me back,

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.298
he made me a full-time contributor,

00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:43.023
and he taped down my chair.

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:45.714
(Laughter)

00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:48.979
(Applause)

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:52.696
One fun fact I learned while on the air
with Keith Olbermann

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.709
was that humans
on the Internet are scumbags.

00:10:56.733 --> 00:10:57.734
(Laughter)

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.322
People say children are cruel,

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:02.266
but I was never made fun of
as a child or an adult.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.961
Suddenly, my disability
on the world wide web is fair game.

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:09.582
I would look at clips online
and see comments like,

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:12.242
"Yo, why's she tweakin'?"

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.544
"Yo, is she retarded?"

00:11:14.568 --> 00:11:17.758
And my favorite,
"Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.580
What does she suffer from?

00:11:19.604 --> 00:11:21.302
We should really pray for her."

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.660
One commenter even suggested
that I add my disability to my credits:

00:11:27.684 --> 00:11:30.017
screenwriter, comedian, palsy.

00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:35.620
Disability is as visual as race.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.480
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,

00:11:38.504 --> 00:11:41.353
then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.765
The disabled are the largest —

00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:46.568
Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.

00:11:46.592 --> 00:11:51.052
(Applause)

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.567
People with disabilities
are the largest minority in the world,

00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:58.297
and we are the most underrepresented
in entertainment.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.326
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.008
but I am here in front of you.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:06.254
However, if I grew up with social media,

00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:07.698
I don't think I would be.

00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:09.554
I hope that together,

00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:12.129
we can create more positive images

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:15.493
of disability in the media
and in everyday life.

00:12:15.882 --> 00:12:18.339
Perhaps if there were
more positive images,

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.958
it would foster less hate on the Internet.

00:12:22.085 --> 00:12:23.261
Or maybe not.

00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:27.293
Maybe it still takes a village
to teach our children well.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.469
My crooked journey has taken me
to some very spectacular places.

00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:35.443
I got to walk the red carpet

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:38.222
flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci

00:12:38.246 --> 00:12:40.287
and the iconic Loreen Arbus.

00:12:40.311 --> 00:12:42.948
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler

00:12:42.972 --> 00:12:46.959
and work with my idol,
the amazing Dave Matthews.

00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:50.509
I toured the world as a headliner
on Arabs Gone Wild.

00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:56.203
I was a delegate representing
the great state of New Jersey

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:58.463
at the 2008 DNC.

00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:00.965
And I founded Maysoon's Kids,

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:05.024
a charity that hopes
to give Palestinian refugee children

00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:07.580
a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.

00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:10.407
But the one moment
that stands out the most

00:13:10.431 --> 00:13:12.932
was when I got -- before this moment --

00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:16.610
(Laughter)

00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:20.406
(Applause)

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.858
But the one moment
that stands out the most

00:13:23.882 --> 00:13:25.984
was when I got to perform

00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:28.210
for the man who floats like a butterfly

00:13:28.234 --> 00:13:29.762
and stings like a bee,

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:33.075
has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:35.332
Muhammad Ali.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.425
(Applause)

00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:43.576
(Applause ends)

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.179
It was the only time
that my father ever saw me perform live,

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:51.362
and I dedicate this talk to his memory.

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:53.758
(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.

00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:56.202
(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,

00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:59.413
and if I can can, you can can.

00:13:59.437 --> 00:14:01.282
(Cheering)

00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:05.380
(Applause)
