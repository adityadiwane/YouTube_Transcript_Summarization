00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
which was this very implausible technology

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
that technically could have worked,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.160
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
This was a perfect introduction.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And it's a story that did work. It did happen,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and the machines are all around us.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And it was a technology that was inevitable.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
If the people I'm going to tell you the story about,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
It's the universe in which these machines

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.160
are now doing all these things, including changing biology.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
And three of the smartest people were

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
he was working on something much more important than bombs:

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
he's thinking about computers.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
(Laughter)

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
He built this machine,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
The first person to really explain that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
you can do it all with arithmetic.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
He said you needed addition and subtraction.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 --

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
showed that you didn't even need subtraction.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
You could do the whole thing with addition.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
that drove the computer revolution.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
He talked about doing it with marbles,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
having gates and what we now call shift registers,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And that's what all these machines are doing,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
except, instead of doing it with marbles,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
they're doing it with electrons.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
to actually try and build such a machine.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet --

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
which also goes back to Turing,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
with a very brainless, little, finite state machine,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
but capable of only two ideas.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160
(Laughter)

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And that's really the simplest computer.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
It's basically why you need the qubit,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
because it only has two ideas.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
And you put lots of those together,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
you get the essentials of the modern computer:

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
the recording medium, the input and the output.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
we saw it in starting these programs up.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
The instructions which govern this operation

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
If you look at the origins of this,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Such a computer would open up universes,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
The guy who was supposed to build this machine

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
of all time, decided not to go into computers.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
televisions are the future, not computers.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
The essentials were all there --

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
all the things that make these machines run.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
where Freeman works at the Institute.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
That's where I grew up as a kid.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
so we both go back to the birth of this thing.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
That's Freeman, a long time ago,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
and that was me.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
who wrote the "Theory of Games."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
All these forces came together there, in Princeton.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And Julian Bigelow, who took

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
They didn't fit in at the Institute.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
This is a letter from the director, concerned about --

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
(Laughter)

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160
You can read the text.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.160
(Laughter)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.160
(Laughter).

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
These were not theoretical physicists.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.160
has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160
to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.160
because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
at 15 other places around the world.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
All the computers now are copies of that machine.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
The memory was in cathode ray tubes --

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube --

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
So, there's 40 of these tubes,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
like a V-40 engine running the memory.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
(Laughter)

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.160
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.160
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
This is modifying IBM equipment,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.160
that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
reliable machines out of unreliable components.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
This includes a large amount of human error.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
What's code, what's hardware?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
let alone having, you know, software problems.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
"No use, went home." (Laughter)

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
So, already, they're complaining about the manuals:

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
"before closing down in disgust ... "

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
"The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Burning lots of midnight oil.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:57.160
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
"Found trouble in code, I hope."

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
"Code error, machine not guilty."

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
(Laughter)

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160
"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter)

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
"Something's wrong with the air conditioner --

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
smell of burning V-belts in the air."

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
"A short -- do not turn the machine on."

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.160
"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
So they really were working under tough conditions.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.160
(Laughter)

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160
(Laughter)

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:01.160
"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160
(Laughter)

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
There's an inside joke someone has penciled in:

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
"Here lies Marston Mouse."

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
If you're a mathematician, you get that,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160
because Marston was a mathematician who

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
objected to the computer being there.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
That's two thousand cycles per second --

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
"yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
that's slow speed.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
"I have now duplicated both results.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
This now is the third different output.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
I know when I'm licked."

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
(Laughter)

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
"We've duplicated errors before."

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
"Only happens when the machine is running."

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.160
And sometimes things are okay.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
late one night, finally drew a bomb.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
So, that was the result. It was Mike,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
That was designed on that machine,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
in the woods behind the Institute.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
from all over the world to work on all these problems.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.160
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
trying to see if, in this artificial universe --

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
And he saw everything in terms of --

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
he could read the binary code straight off the machine.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
He had a wonderful rapport.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Even errors were duplicated.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
(Laughter)

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
So he designed this universe, and ran it.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
He would run that thing all night long, running these things,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
who reinvented this stuff.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
It was published in the literature.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
So, he decided to give it a try,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.160
to start this artificial biology going in the machines.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
And he found all these, sort of --

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
it was like a naturalist coming in

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
and seeing all these things happening

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
that we see in the outside world, in biology.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.160
This is some of the generations of his universe.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
But they're just going to stay numbers;

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
they're not going to become organisms.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.160
They have to have something.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with --

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
playing chess with other machines and so on.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
And they did start to evolve.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
And he went around the country after that.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and saw exactly what's happening now.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.160
That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
you'd keep running

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160
he envisioned all that happening.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
that would have some intelligence.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And he went out of his way to say

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
that he was not saying this was lifelike,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
or a new kind of life.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
It just was another version of the same thing happening.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
and what nature did billions of years ago.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
And could you do it again now?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
the archivist came up one day, saying,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And it was his universe on punch cards.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.160
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
That's the instructions for running --

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
this is actually the source code

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
for one of those universes,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
with a note from the engineers

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160
saying they're having some problems.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.160
"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
What's the dividing line between

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
And the question is, should we run them or not?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
You know, could we get them running?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
These machines would think they --

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
these organisms, if they came back to life now --

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.160
My laptop is 10 thousand million times

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
He was thinking far ahead, to

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
how this would really grow into a new kind of life.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
And that's what's happening!

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
When Juan Enriquez told us about

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160
these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
that's what Barricelli imagined:

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
that this digital code in these machines

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
is actually starting to code --

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
it already is coding from nucleic acids.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.160
and synthesizing small strings of DNA.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
on self-reproducing machines,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
to where they begin to reproduce.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
It took really three people:

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines --

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
that now, last count, four million

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.160
and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago --

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
this is John Markoff's obituary for him --

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
he was the important missing link,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
the engineer who came in

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
And all our computers have, inside them,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.160
the copies of the architecture that he had to just design

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
one day, sort of on pencil and paper.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
And he explained, in a very generous way,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
the spirit that brought all these different people to

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160
no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160
That's the last entry in the logbook

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160
when the machine was shut down, July 1958.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
when the machine was officially turned off.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And that's the end.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
Thank you very much.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160
(Applause)
