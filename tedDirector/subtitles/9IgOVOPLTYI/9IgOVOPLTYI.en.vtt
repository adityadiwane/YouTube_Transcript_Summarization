00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:20.355
My students often ask me,
"What is sociology?"

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:25.170
And I tell them it's the study of the way
in which human beings are shaped

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:26.947
by things that they don't see.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.085
And they say, "So,
how can I be a sociologist?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.038
How can I understand
those invisible forces?"

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:35.590
And I say, "Empathy.

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:37.714
Start with empathy.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.520
It all begins with empathy.

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:42.300
Take yourself out of your shoes,

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.968
put yourself into the shoes
of another person."

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:46.622
Here, I'll give you an example.

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:50.927
So I imagine my life
if, a hundred years ago,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.801
China had been the most powerful
nation in the world

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.312
and they came to the United States
in search of coal.

00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:00.527
And they found it, and, in fact,
they found lots of it right here.

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:04.077
And pretty soon,
they began shipping that coal,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:05.877
ton by ton,

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:09.339
railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:12.448
back to China and elsewhere
around the world.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.579
And they got fabulously
wealthy in doing so.

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:17.936
And they built beautiful cities

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.060
all powered on that coal.

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:26.293
And back here in the United States,

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.464
we saw economic despair, deprivation.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.936
This is what I saw.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.591
I saw people struggling to get by,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.710
not knowing what was what
and what was next.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.001
And I asked myself the question:

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:41.355
How is it possible that we could
be so poor here in the United States,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:45.084
because coal is such a wealthy
resource; it's so much money?

00:01:45.108 --> 00:01:46.268
And I realize:

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:49.697
because the Chinese ingratiated themselves

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:52.480
with a small ruling class
here in the United States,

00:01:52.504 --> 00:01:56.042
who stole all of that money
and all of that wealth for themselves.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.856
And the rest of us,
the vast majority of us,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.145
struggle to get by.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.753
And the Chinese
gave this small ruling elite

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:07.146
loads of military weapons
and sophisticated technology

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.936
in order to ensure that people like me

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.960
would not speak out
against this relationship.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.269
Does this sound familiar?

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:20.066
And they did things like train Americans
to help protect the coal.

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:23.554
And everywhere, there were
symbols of the Chinese --

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.554
everywhere, a constant reminder.

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:29.334
And back in China,

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.684
what do they say in China?

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:34.307
Nothing! They don't talk about us.
They don't talk about the coal.

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.521
If you ask them,

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.936
they'll say, "Well, you know,
we need the coal.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.158
I mean, come on, I'm not going
to turn down my thermostat.

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:43.087
You can't expect that."

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:46.809
And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.146
as do lots of average people.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.712
And we fight back,
and it gets really ugly.

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:54.145
And the Chinese respond
in a very ugly way.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.275
And before we know it,
they send in the tanks

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.996
and they send in the troops.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:02.290
And lots of people are dying.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.711
And it's a very, very difficult situation.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.983
Can you imagine what you would feel

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.172
if you were in my shoes?

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.521
Can you imagine
walking out of this building

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:17.363
and seeing a tank sitting out there,

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.714
or a truck full of soldiers?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.380
Just imagine what you would feel,
because you know why they're here;

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.050
you know what they're doing here.

00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:28.961
And you just feel the anger
and you feel the fear.

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:32.400
If you can, that's empathy.
That's empathy.

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:35.603
You've left your shoes,
and you've stood in mine.

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:38.213
And you've got to feel that.

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:39.936
OK, so that's the warm-up.

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:41.488
That's the warm-up.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:45.246
Now we're going to have
the real radical experiment.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.936
So, for the remainder of my talk,
what I want you to do

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.548
is put yourselves in the shoes
of an ordinary Arab Muslim

00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:55.301
living in the Middle East --

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:57.451
in particular, in Iraq.

00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:00.886
And so to help you,

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:05.507
perhaps you're a member
of this middle-class family in Baghdad.

00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:08.558
What you want is the best for your kids.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.559
You want your kids to have a better life.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.670
And you watch the news, you pay attention.

00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:16.248
You read the newspaper, you go down
to the coffee shop with your friends,

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:18.493
you read the newspapers
from around the world.

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.553
Sometimes you even watch satellite,
CNN, from the United States.

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.064
You have a sense of what
the Americans are thinking.

00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:27.136
But really, you just want
a better life for yourself.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.348
That's what you want.

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:31.769
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:33.540
You want a better life for yourself.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:34.778
So here, let me help you.

00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:38.293
Let me help you with some things
that you might be thinking.

00:04:38.317 --> 00:04:39.586
Number one:

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.936
this incursion into your land
these past 20 years and before --

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.079
the reason anyone
is interested in your land,

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:48.247
and particularly
the United States, is oil.

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:51.380
It's all about oil; you know that,
everybody knows that.

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:54.504
People back in the United States
know it's about oil.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.817
It's because somebody else
has a design for your resource.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.394
It's your resource --
it's not somebody else's.

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:05.396
It's your land; it's your resource.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.093
Somebody else has a design for it.

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:09.891
And you know why they have a design?

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:12.012
You know why they have
their eyes set on it?

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:14.110
Because they have
an entire economic system

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:17.343
that's dependent
on that oil -- foreign oil,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.993
oil from other parts of the world
that they don't own.

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:23.074
And what else do you think
about these people?

00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:24.506
The Americans, they're rich.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.051
Come on, they live in big houses,
they have big cars.

00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:29.475
They all have blond hair,
blue eyes. They're happy.

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:33.008
You think that. It's not true, of course,
but that's the media impression.

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.228
And that's what you get.

00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:35.460
And they have big cities,

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:38.587
and the cities are all dependent on oil.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.936
And back home, what do you see?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.984
Poverty, despair, struggle.

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.868
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.

00:05:46.892 --> 00:05:48.939
I mean -- this is Iraq.

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.448
This is what you see.

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:54.786
You see people struggling to get by.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.202
It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.

00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:58.893
And you feel something about this.

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:01.014
These people have designs
for your resource,

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.343
and this is what you see?

00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:05.354
Something else you see
that you talk about --

00:06:05.378 --> 00:06:07.588
Americans don't talk
about this, but you do --

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:10.139
there's this thing,
this militarization of the world,

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:12.307
and it's centered
right in the United States.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:14.205
And the United States is responsible

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.707
for almost one half
of the world's military spending.

00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:21.516
Four percent of the world's population!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.084
And you feel it; you see it every day.

00:06:24.108 --> 00:06:25.430
It's part of your life.

00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:28.232
And you talk about it with your friends.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.844
You read about it.

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:33.099
And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:36.647
the Americans didn't care
about his crimes.

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.088
When he was gassing
the Kurds and gassing Iran,

00:06:39.112 --> 00:06:40.587
they didn't care about it.

00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.690
When oil was at stake,

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:46.174
somehow, suddenly, things mattered.

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:50.147
And what you see, something else:

00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:51.957
the United States,

00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.090
the hub of democracy around the world --

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:57.753
they don't seem to really be supporting
democratic countries

00:06:57.777 --> 00:06:59.664
all around the world.

00:06:59.688 --> 00:07:02.407
There are a lot of countries,
oil-producing countries,

00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:05.659
that aren't very democratic,
but supported by the United States.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.553
That's odd.

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:10.378
Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,

00:07:10.402 --> 00:07:12.714
the 10 years of sanctions,

00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:16.409
the eight years of occupation,

00:07:16.433 --> 00:07:20.087
the insurgency that's been
unleashed on your people,

00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:22.936
the tens of thousands,
the hundreds of thousands

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.424
of civilian deaths?

00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:30.020
All because of oil.

00:07:30.888 --> 00:07:32.404
You can't help but think that.

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:34.229
You talk about it.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.436
It's in the forefront
of your mind, always.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.975
You say, "How is that possible?"

00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:42.888
And this man, he's everyman --

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.011
your grandfather, your uncle,

00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:48.098
your father, your son, your neighbor,

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:49.767
your professor, your student.

00:07:50.352 --> 00:07:53.231
Once a life of happiness and joy

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:55.272
and suddenly, pain and sorrow.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.574
Everyone in your country
has been touched by the violence,

00:08:03.598 --> 00:08:06.683
the bloodshed, the pain,
the horror -- everybody.

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:11.880
Not a single person in your country
has not been touched.

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:13.936
But there's something else.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.936
There's something else about these people,
these Americans who are there.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.161
There's something else
about them that you see

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:21.759
that they don't see themselves.

00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:23.935
And what do you see? They're Christians!

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.427
They're Christians.

00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:28.952
They worship the Christian God,
they have crosses, they carry Bibles.

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.134
Their Bibles have a little insignia

00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:33.933
that says "US Army" on them.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.936
And their leaders, their leaders:

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.253
before they send their sons and daughters
off to war in your country --

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:43.615
and you know the reason --

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:45.206
before they send them off,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.532
they go to a Christian church,
and they pray to their Christian God,

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:51.340
and they ask for protection
and guidance from that god.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.541
Why?

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:56.618
Well, obviously,
when people die in the war,

00:08:56.642 --> 00:09:01.221
they are Muslims, they are Iraqis --
they're not Americans.

00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:04.065
You don't want Americans to die --
"Protect Our Troops."

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:06.420
And you feel something about that --

00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:07.647
of course you do.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:09.598
And they do wonderful things.

00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:11.436
You read about it, you hear about it.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.678
They're there to build schools
and help people.

00:09:13.702 --> 00:09:15.071
That's what they want to do.

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:17.863
They do wonderful things,
but they also do the bad things,

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:19.522
and you can't tell the difference.

00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:22.313
And this guy, you get a guy
like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:24.834
Here's a guy who says
that your god is a false god.

00:09:24.858 --> 00:09:26.936
Your god's an idol;
his god is the true god.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.056
The solution to the problem
in the Middle East, according to him,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.014
is to convert you all to Christianity --

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.494
just get rid of your religion.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.671
And you know that.
Americans don't read about this guy.

00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:38.936
They don't know anything
about him, but you do.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.151
You pass it around.
You pass his words around.

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:43.747
I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:47.011
He was one of the leading commanders
in the second invasion of Iraq.

00:09:47.035 --> 00:09:49.749
And you're thinking,
"My God, if this guy is saying that,

00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:51.880
then all the soldiers
must be saying that."

00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:53.857
And this word here --

00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.794
George Bush called this war a crusade.

00:09:55.818 --> 00:09:58.296
Man, the Americans,
they're just like, "Ah, crusade.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.266
Whatever. I don't know what that means."

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.315
You know what it means --
it's a holy war against Muslims.

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:07.168
Look, invade, subdue them,
take their resources.

00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:09.002
If they won't submit, kill them.

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:10.816
That's what this is about.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.468
And you're thinking, "My God,
these Christians are coming to kill us."

00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:15.936
This is frightening.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.714
You feel frightened.
Of course you feel frightened.

00:10:18.738 --> 00:10:21.435
And this man, Terry Jones:

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:24.206
I mean here's a guy
who wants to burn Qurans, right?

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.883
And the Americans:
"Ah, he's a knucklehead.

00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:30.536
He's a former hotel manager; he's got
three dozen members of his church ..."

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.727
They laugh him off.

00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:34.937
You don't laugh him off,
because in the context of everything else,

00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:36.112
all the pieces fit.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.020
Of course this is how Americans think.

00:10:38.044 --> 00:10:41.047
So people all over the Middle East,
not just in your country,

00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:42.227
are protesting.

00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:44.182
"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:46.334
These Christians --
who are these Christians?

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:49.773
They're so evil, they're so mean --
this is what they're about?"

00:10:49.797 --> 00:10:52.412
This is what you're thinking
as an Arab Muslim,

00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:53.845
as an Iraqi.

00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:55.846
Of course you're going to think this.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.794
And then your cousin says,
"Hey coz, check out this website.

00:10:59.818 --> 00:11:02.092
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.

00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:03.394
These Christians are nuts!

00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:06.285
They're training their little kids
to be soldiers for Jesus.

00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:08.894
They take little kids
and run them through these things

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.220
till they teach them
how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:14.356
and things like 'grenade toss'
and 'weapons care and maintenance.'

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.412
And go to the website --
it says 'US Army' right on it.

00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:19.346
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.380
How can they do this
to their little kids?"

00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:22.935
And you're reading this website.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:25.780
And of course, Christians
in the United States, or anybody,

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:28.685
says, "This is some little church
in the middle of nowhere."

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:29.860
You don't know that.

00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:32.293
For you, this is like, all Christians.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.619
It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."

00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:35.972
And look at this.

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:37.812
They even teach their kids --

00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:40.649
they train them in the same way
the US Marines train.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.634
Isn't that interesting.

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:44.936
And it scares you, and it frightens you.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.936
So these guys, you see them.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.144
You see, I, Sam Richards --
I know who these guys are.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.101
They're my students, my friends;
I know what they're thinking.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.333
You don't know.

00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:56.902
When you see them, they're something else.

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:58.960
They're something else.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.126
That's what they are to you.

00:12:02.168 --> 00:12:04.635
We don't see it that way
in the United States,

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.095
but you see it that way.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.127
So here.

00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:13.793
Of course, you've got it wrong.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:16.300
You're generalizing. It's wrong.

00:12:16.324 --> 00:12:18.611
You don't understand the Americans.

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:20.315
It's not a Christian invasion.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:23.312
We're not just there for oil;
we're there for lots of reasons.

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:25.349
You have it wrong. You've missed it.

00:12:25.373 --> 00:12:28.150
And of course, most of you
don't support the insurgency;

00:12:28.174 --> 00:12:29.932
you don't support killing Americans;

00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:31.936
you don't support the terrorists.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.936
Of course you don't. Very few people do.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.224
But -- some of you do.

00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:38.654
And this is a perspective.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.773
OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.

00:12:41.797 --> 00:12:45.758
Step outside of your shoes
that you're in right now,

00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:47.572
and step back into your normal shoes.

00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.571
So everyone's back in the room. OK?

00:12:50.525 --> 00:12:52.426
Now here comes the radical experiment.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.807
So we're all back home.

00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.568
This photo: this woman --

00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:58.465
man, I feel her.

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.062
I feel her.

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:01.566
She's my sister,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.774
my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.

00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.194
She's anybody to me.

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:08.925
These guys standing there,
everybody in the photo --

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:10.666
I feel this photo, man.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:13.727
So here's what I want you to do.

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.803
Let's go back to my first
example, of the Chinese.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.582
I want you to go there.

00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:22.836
It's all about coal, and the Chinese
are here in the United States.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.606
What I want you to do is picture her

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.558
as a Chinese woman
receiving a Chinese flag

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:32.251
because her loved one has died
in America in the coal uprising.

00:13:32.872 --> 00:13:34.501
And the soldiers are Chinese,

00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:36.400
and everybody else is Chinese.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.880
As an American, how do you feel
about this picture?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.086
What do you think about that scene?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.482
OK, try this. Bring it back.

00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:50.936
This is the scene here.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.826
It's an American, American soldiers,

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.905
American woman who lost
her loved one in the Middle East,

00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:58.132
in Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:00.132
Now, put yourself in the shoes,

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:04.011
go back to the shoes
of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:11.063
What are you feeling and thinking
about this photo,

00:14:11.087 --> 00:14:12.900
about this woman?

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:22.936
OK,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.936
now follow me on this,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.091
because I'm taking a big risk here.

00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:29.854
And so I'm going to invite you
to take a risk with me.

00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:31.855
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:35.888
They were caught by the American soldiers,
trying to kill Americans.

00:14:35.912 --> 00:14:39.322
And maybe they succeeded.
Maybe they succeeded.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:43.720
Put yourself in the shoes
of the Americans who caught them.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.547
Can you feel the rage?

00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:48.953
Can you feel that you just want
to take these guys

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.427
and wring their necks?

00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:51.701
Can you go there?

00:14:52.595 --> 00:14:54.270
It shouldn't be that difficult.

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:57.598
You just -- oh, man.

00:14:58.534 --> 00:15:03.705
Now, put yourself in their shoes.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.008
Are they brutal killers

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:09.985
or patriotic defenders?

00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:13.114
Which one?

00:15:13.751 --> 00:15:16.936
Can you feel their anger,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.391
their fear,

00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:20.391
their rage

00:15:21.084 --> 00:15:23.281
at what has happened in their country?

00:15:23.305 --> 00:15:27.708
Can you imagine that maybe
one of them, in the morning,

00:15:27.732 --> 00:15:30.864
bent down to their child
and hugged their child

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:34.865
and said, "Dear, I'll be back later.

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:38.218
I'm going out to defend
your freedom, your lives.

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.715
I'm going out to look out for us,

00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:43.253
the future of our country."

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.637
Can you imagine that?

00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:47.164
Can you imagine saying that?

00:15:48.388 --> 00:15:49.804
Can you go there?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.695
What do you think they're feeling?

00:16:02.983 --> 00:16:04.388
You see, that's empathy.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:06.586
It's also understanding.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.238
[understand]

00:16:08.262 --> 00:16:09.570
Now, you might ask,

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.861
"OK, Sam, so why do you
do this sort of thing?

00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:15.245
Why would you use
this example of all examples?"

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:17.936
And I say, because.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.761
You're allowed to hate these people.

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:24.936
You're allowed to just hate them
with every fiber of your being.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.737
And if I can get you
to step into their shoes

00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:32.318
and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.854
then imagine the kind
of sociological analysis

00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:39.496
that you can do in all other
aspects of your life.

00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:41.936
You can walk a mile

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.031
when it comes to understanding why
that person's driving 40 miles per hour

00:16:47.055 --> 00:16:48.452
in the passing lane;

00:16:49.253 --> 00:16:50.924
or your teenage son;

00:16:51.634 --> 00:16:55.277
or your neighbor who annoys you
by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.

00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:58.157
Whatever it is, you can go so far.

00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:00.856
And this is what I tell my students:

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.372
step outside of your tiny, little world.

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:08.908
Step inside of the tiny,
little world of somebody else.

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:10.590
And then do it again

00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:12.313
and do it again and do it again.

00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:14.446
And suddenly, all these tiny,
little worlds,

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.722
they come together in this complex web.

00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:19.816
And they build a big, complex world.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.219
And suddenly, without realizing it,

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:24.420
you're seeing the world differently.

00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.207
Everything has changed.

00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.974
Everything in your life has changed.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:32.154
And that's, of course, what this is about.

00:17:32.178 --> 00:17:35.300
Attend to other lives,

00:17:35.324 --> 00:17:36.682
other visions.

00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:39.131
Listen to other people,

00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:41.000
enlighten ourselves.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:45.396
I'm not saying that I support
the terrorists in Iraq.

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:49.270
But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.709
I understand.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.188
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too.

00:17:58.212 --> 00:17:59.364
Thank you.

00:17:59.388 --> 00:18:02.267
(Applause)
