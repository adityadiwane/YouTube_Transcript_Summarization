00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
of youth and age.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
The first one is dedicated to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
My poem is called "Dirt."

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
half a long century gone

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and still she comes at me

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
with that thick cruel yellow bar.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
All because of a word I said,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
not even said really, only repeated.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
But "Open," she says, "open up!"

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
her hand clawing at my head.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
I know now her life was hard;

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
she lost three children as babies,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
then her husband died too,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
leaving young sons, and no money.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
She'd stand me in the sink to pee

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
because there was never room in the toilet.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
But oh, her soap!

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Might its bitter burning have been

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
what made me a poet?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
The street she lived on was unpaved,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
where she stalked and caught me.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Dare I admit that after she did it

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I never really loved her again?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
She lived to a hundred,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
but I never, until now

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
loved her again.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
When that was published in a magazine

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
I got an irate letter from my uncle.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.160
"You have maligned a great woman."

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.160
It took some diplomacy.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
This is called "The Dress."

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
It's a longer poem.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
In those days,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
those days which exist for me only

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
as the most elusive memory now,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
would be a storm of birdsong,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
then the soft clop of the hooves

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and the last sound at night as likely as not

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
would be your father pulling up in his car,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
having worked late again, always late,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
to shake out the ashes and damp the draft

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
before he came upstairs to fall into bed --

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
in those long-ago days,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
women, my mother, my friends' mothers,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
our neighbors, all the women I knew --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
wore, often much of the day,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
what were called housedresses,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
cheap, printed, pulpy,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
seemingly purposefully shapeless

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
and, when you had to go look for a child,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
hang wash on the line,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
or run down to the grocery store on the corner,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
under a coat,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
the twisted hem of the nightgown

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
always lank and yellowed,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
dangling beneath.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
More than the curlers some of the women

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
seemed constantly to have in their hair

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
in preparation for some great event --

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
a ball, one would think --

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
that never came to pass;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
more than the way most women's faces

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
not only were never made up during the day,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
but seemed scraped, bleached,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
more than all that it was those dresses

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
that made women so unknowable and forbidding,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and boys no conception.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
Only later would I see the dresses also

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
as a proclamation:

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
your bleak concrete yard,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
what you revealed of yourself

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
was a fabulation;

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
your real sensual nature,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
veiled in those sexless vestments,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
was utterly your dominion.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160
In those days, one hid much else as well:

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
grown men didn't embrace one another,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
unless someone had died,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
and not always then; you shook hands

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
once out of childhood you'd never again know

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
not until mores at last had evolved,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
then even kiss (your fathers bristles

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
white and stiff now).

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
What release finally, the embrace:

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
how much unspoken joy there was

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
in that affirmation of equality and communion,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
no matter how much misunderstanding

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
and pain had passed between you by then.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
We knew so little in those days,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
as little as now, I suppose

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
about healing those hurts:

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
even the women, in their best dresses,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
even in lipstick and mascara,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
their hair aflow,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
could only stand wringing their hands,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
begging for peace,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
while father and son, like thugs,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
like thieves, like Romans,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
simmered and hissed and hated,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
inflicting sorrows that endured,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
the worst anyway,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
through the kiss and embrace,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
bleeding from brother to brother,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
into the generations.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
In those days there was still countryside

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
even not far from our building

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
you could find tracts with hills and trees

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
you could pretend were mountains and forests.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Or you could go out by yourself

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
even to a half-block-long empty lot,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160
crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
already there was wanting to be simpler,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
wanting, when they called you,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
never to go back.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:53.160
(Applause)

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
This is another longish one,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
about the old and the young.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
It actually happened right at the time we met.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
Part of the poem takes place in

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
space we shared and time we shared.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
It's called "The Neighbor."

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Her five horrid, deformed little dogs

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
who incessantly yap on the roof under my window.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Her cats, God knows how many,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
who must piss on her rugs --

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
her landing's a sickening reek.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
then the door slamming fearfully shut,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
only the barking and the music -- jazz --

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160
filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" --

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
how it brought back my college sweetheart,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
my first real love, who -- till I left her --

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
played the same record.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.160
sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
she was too young for,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160
It startled, then bored, then repelled me.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
in the Village, that my neighbor was her.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160
My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
her turning away, hiding her ravaged face

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.160
A man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
claws scrabbling, then her -- her voice

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
hoarse, harsh, hollow,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
almost only a tone,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
incoherent, a note, a squawk,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
bone on metal, metal gone molten,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
calling them back,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
My sweet angels, come back."

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Medea she was, next time I saw her.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
stock-still on the sidewalk

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
ragged coat hanging agape,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
passersby flowing around her,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
her mouth torn suddenly open

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
as though in a scream,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
silently though, as though only in her brain

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
or breast had it erupted.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.160
A cry so pure, practiced, detached,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
it had no need of a voice,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
or could no longer bear one.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
These invisible links that allure,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.160
these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
The girl, my old love,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
the last lost time I saw her

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
when she came to find me at a party,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
her drunkenly stumbling, falling,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
swollen with tears, her shame,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
her dishonor.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
my secret pride, my turning away.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Still life on a rooftop,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.160
dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
dogs, excrement, sky.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
What pathways through pain,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
what junctures of vulnerability,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
what crossings and counterings?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Too many lives in our lives already,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
too many chances for sorrow,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
too many unaccounted-for pasts.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
"Behold me," the god of frenzied,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
inexhaustible love says,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.160
rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Her making her way

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
down the littered vestibule stairs,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
one agonized step at a time.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
My holding the door.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
Her crossing the fragmented tiles,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
faltering at the step to the street,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
droning, not looking at me,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
"Can you help me?"

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
Her wavering step into the world.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:20.160
Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:29.160
(Applause)

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
I think I'll lighten up a little.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
(Laughter)

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
It's called "Gas."

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
(Laughter)

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Wouldn't it be nice, I think,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
bends over the magazine table

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
and farts, just a little,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
and violently blushes.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
came embodied in visible clouds,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
had only barely grazed my face

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
before it drifted away.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
(Laughter)

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Besides, for this to have happened now

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
while we were on our walk,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
my dog was startled by a backfire

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
and jumped straight up like a horse bucking.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
And that brought back to me the stable

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
I worked on weekends when I was 12,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
and a splendid piebald stallion,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
though more hugely of course,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
enormous, gleaming, resplendent.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And the woman, her face abashedly buried

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
in her "Elle" now, reminded me --

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
consisted of the fact that with every jump he took

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
the horse would powerfully fart.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
Something never mentioned

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
in the dozens of books about horses

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
and their riders I devoured in those days.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
All that savage grandeur,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
the steely glinting hooves,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160
the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.160
breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
(Laughter)

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:26.160
(Applause)

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.160
This is called "Thirst."

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
Many -- most of my poems actually

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.160
are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
"Thirst."

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
day and night, on a bench

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
in the 103rd Street subway station,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
until finally one day she vanished.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.160
We regarded each other, scrutinized one another.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160
Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160
wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
I was afraid some repressed part of myself

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
in the shocking seethe of her stench.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
Not excrement merely, not merely surface

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
and orifice going unwashed,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
rediffusion of rum,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
there was will in it,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160
and intention, power and purpose --

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
a social, ethical rage and rebellion --

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.160
despair too, though, grief, loss.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
bathe her, comfort her, dress her.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Instead, I'd step into my train.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
How rich I would think, is the lexicon

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
of our self-absolving.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
How enduring, our bland fatal assurance

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.160
that reflection is righteousness being accomplished.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
The dance of our glances,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
the clash, pulling each other through

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
our perceptual punctures,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
then holocaust, holocaust,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
host on host of ill, injured presences,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
squandered, consumed.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
Her vigil somewhere I know continues.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160
Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:44.160
effacement, the perfume of our consternation.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:51.160
(Applause)

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
The title is "This Happened."

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
A student, a young woman

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
perched on the ledge of an open window

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
chatting with friends between classes;

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
a teacher passes and chides her,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
"Be careful, you might fall,"

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
almost banteringly chides her,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
"You might fall,"

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
and the young woman, 18, a girl really,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
though she wouldn't think that,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
as brilliant as she is, first in her class,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
smiles back, and leans into the open window,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.160
which wouldn't even be open if it were winter --

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160
if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") --

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
leans into the window, farther, still smiling,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
farther and farther, though it takes less time

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.160
than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Herself fall.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
A casual impulse, a fancy,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
No, more than impulse or fancy,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
the girl knows what she's doing,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
the girl means something,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
the girl means to mean,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
because it occurs to her in that instant,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
she's not who she is,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
she's not the person she is,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160
and the reason, she suddenly knows,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
is that there's been so much premeditation

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
where she is, so much plotting and planning,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
there's hardly a person where she is,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.160
or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.160
it's a self inhabited, lived in by her,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
and seemingly even as she thinks it

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
she knows what's been missing:

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
grace,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
not premeditation but grace,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160
a kind of being in the world spontaneously,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
with grace.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
Weightfully upon me was the world.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.160
Weightfully this self which graced the world

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.160
yet never wholly itself.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.160
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.160
the release from which is what I desire

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
and what I achieve.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.160
And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.160
already now so many times divided,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
the sadness she felt once,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
hardly knowing she felt it,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
to merely inhabit herself.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.160
even the earth with its compulsion

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
to take unto itself all that falls

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
must know that falling is absurd,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.160
yet the girl falling isn't myself,

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
or she is myself,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.160
but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.160
Forever. With grace.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
This happened.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:01.160
(Applause)

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
I like to just end.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160
But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.160
and shake his fist at me.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
"Special: big tits,"

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
on our neighborhood newsstand.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
But forget her breasts.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
A lush, fresh-lipped blond,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
skin glowing gold, sprawls there,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
resplendent.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.160
hardly better than harlots, can still stir me.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160
Maybe a coming of age in the

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.160
American sensual darkness,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
never seeing an unsmudged nipple,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.160
an uncensored vagina,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.160
has left me forever infected

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
with an unquenchable lust of the eye.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
Always that erotic murmur,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.160
I'm hardly myself

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.160
if I'm not in a state of incipient desire.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
God knows though,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.160
there are worse twists your obsessions can take.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.160
Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.160
guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
forbade them to look in one room.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.160
Because there were images in it he said were licentious.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.160
The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
some trying to cover their genitals,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
others too frightened to bother,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160
lined up in snow

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160
waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160
The girls, to my horror,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
averted their gaze.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.160
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.160
Even that though. Another confession:

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.160
Once in a book on pre-war Poland,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.160
a studio portrait, an absolute angel,

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
I kept finding myself at her page.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.160
That she died in the camps made her --

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.160
I didn't dare wonder why --

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.160
more present, more precious.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.160
Died in the camps, that too people --

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160
or Jews anyway --

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160
kept from their children back then.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.160
But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.160
Sex and death, how close they can seem.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.160
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.160
sometimes I think I confound them.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160
My wife's loveliness almost consumes me.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160
My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160
When we make love, her holding me

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160
everywhere all around me,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.160
I'm there and not there.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.160
My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.160
I live my life over, as though I were drowning.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.160
Then I am drowning, in despair

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.160
at having to leave her,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.160
this, everything, all,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.160
unbearable, awful.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.160
Still, to be able to die

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160
with no special contrition,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.160
not having been slaughtered, or enslaved.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.160
And not having to know history's next

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.160
mad rage or regression,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.160
it might be a relief.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
No. Again, no.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.160
I don't mean that for a moment.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.160
the good and the bad --

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
my own follies and weakness

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.160
that even this counterfeit Venus

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160
with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.160
with gel, so moves me

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.160
my breath catches.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.160
Vamp. Siren. Seductress.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
How much more she reveals

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.160
in her glare of ink than she knows.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.160
How she incarnates

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.160
our desperate human need for regard,

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.160
our passion to live in beauty,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.160
to be beauty, to be cherished by glances,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.160
if by no more, of something like love,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.160
or love.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160
Thank you.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
(Applause)
