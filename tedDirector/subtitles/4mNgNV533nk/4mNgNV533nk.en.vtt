00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I was listed on the online biography 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
that said I was a design missionary. 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
That's a bit lofty; I'm really more 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
of something like a street walker.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
I spend a lot of time in urban areas 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
looking for design,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
and studying design in the public sector. 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
I take about 5,000 photographs a year, 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
and I thought that I would edit from these,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and try to come up with some images 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
that might be appropriate and interesting to you.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And I used three criteria:

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
the first was, I thought I'd talk about

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
real design within reach,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
design that's free, not design not quite within reach,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.330
but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
stuff that was available to all people,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
A very common public design done in the '50s.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
very consistent with the Brazilian culture --

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
I think good design adds to culture.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
But I think these are my sort of information highways:

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
I live in much more of an analog world,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
where pedestrian traffic and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
interaction and diversity exchange,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and where I think the simple things under our feet

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
have a great amount of meaning to us.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
How did I get started in this business?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
and just loved utilitarian form --

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
simple things that we use every day,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
little compositions of color and surface on form.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
a company dealing with simple forms,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
making good designers available to us,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
and also selling the personalities and character of the designers

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
as well, and it seems to have worked.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
A couple of years into the process,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
I was there going into the design stores,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
and mixing with our crowd of designers,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
has had that in our community also.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
and it's getting increasingly more difficult

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
to find design that reflects a unique culture.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and I recognized, you know, the big story

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
it's what's out on the streets,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and maybe it's self-explanatory,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
in which people get around and where pedestrian rights

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
are protected.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
that I realized that design, that common design,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
that's in the public area means a lot to people,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
I then kind of thought about the other cities

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.330
like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.330
and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
there was something about these important design centers

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
is that there are universities and schools

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
where people can't afford cars,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
but it did seem that in many of these areas

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
pedestrian traffic was protected.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
and recognized, you know, the first job of design

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
is to serve a social purpose.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
but being a very good example of design.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
in the cities, looking at design

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
for common evidence of design

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
I was in Buenos Aires very recently,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
He's a Spanish architect and designer.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
and it was a bit of a disappointment,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
And I recognized that oftentimes design,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
when you're set up to see design,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
it can be a bit of a letdown.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
But there were lots of other things going on in this area:

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
it was a kind of construction zone;

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
a lot of buildings were going up.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
But to me it was an example of

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
I find these little vignettes,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
these little accidental pieces of design,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
to be refreshing.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
They give me, I don't know,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
a sense of correctness in the world

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and some visual delight in the knowledge

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
that the building will probably never look as good

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
as this simple industrial scaffolding

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
that is there to serve.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
going across, these magenta squiggles,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
just a nice, kind of, breakup

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
of the urban place.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And, you know, that no longer exists.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
like listening to little songs or something:

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Antoine Predock designed

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
called Petco Park.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
A terrific use of local materials,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
but inside you could find some interior compositions.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
I go and see design relationships.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
and the way that the trees form vertical elements.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
Red is a color in the landscape

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
that is often on stop signs.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
it stares back at you the way that a figure might.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Construction site in New York:

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
red having this kind of emotional power

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
that's almost an equivalent with the way in which --

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
cuteness of puppies and such.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Side street in Italy.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
Red drew me into this little composition,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
optimistic to me in the sense that maybe

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
the public service's mailbox,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
door service, plumbing.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
It looks as if these different public services

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
work together to create some nice little compositions.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.330
Simple menus put on a board,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
But I'm convinced that it's because

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
you're walking around the streets and seeing things.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
Color can animate simple blocks,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
simple materials:

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
walking in New York, I'll stop.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
I don't always know why I take photographs of things.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
A nice visual composition of symmetry.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Curves against sharp things.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
public seating in the city of New York.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
I've come across some other just,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
kind of, curious relationships

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
of bollards on the street that have different interpretations,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
but -- these things amuse me.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
a trash can that's been left there for 18 months

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
creates a nice 45-degree angle

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
against these other relationships,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
that I see in places that I go.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
Havana is a wonderful area.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
It's quite free of commercial clutter:

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
you don't see our logos and brands and names,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and therefore you're alert to things physically.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.330
And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.330
and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.330
because of the blockades and things,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
but a really wonderful playground.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.330
I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
In our area, in furnishings,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
they're sort of way at the top.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
And I came across this little street in Venice,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
where the communist headquarters

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.330
where they can accept these different ideologies

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
and deal with diversity and not have the problem,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
or they can choose to ignore them,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
but these -- you don't have warring factions,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
which has made Italy so innovative 

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and so tolerant.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.330
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
and I think that it's recognizable there,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
and has an important effect on culture,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
because their public spaces are protected,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
their sidewalks are protected,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
and you're actually able to confront these things

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
physically,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.330
and I think this helps people get over

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
their fear of modernism and other such things.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And I use this -- this is, sort of,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
what I consider to be urban spam.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
but here, private industry is really kind of

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
making a mess of the public sector.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.330
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
the publications that report on problems in the urban area

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
also contribute to it,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and it's just my call to say to all of us,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
public policy won't change this at all;

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
The extreme might be in Italy where, again,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
there's kind of some type of control

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
over what's happening in the environment is very evident,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
and I come down and park in this little spot.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
And I came down one day,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
and all the bikes were red.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
but this was an actual moment

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
when I got off my bike,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and I looked and I thought, it's as if

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
all of my biker brethren

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
had kind of gotten together and conspired

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
to make a little statement.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
And it reminded me that --

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
to keep in the present,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
to look out for these kinds of things.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
It gave me possibilities for wonder --

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
and create some installations.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
But it also reminded me of the power

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
of pattern and repetition

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
to make an effect in our mind.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
than pattern and the way it unites

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
kind of disparate elements.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
I was at the art show in Miami in December,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and amazed at the prices of art

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.330
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
had created, you know, quite a nice little collage

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
of these car keys,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
that I had seen in Tokyo.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
And I thought that if

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
pattern can unite these disparate elements,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
it can do just about anything.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
I don't have very many shots of people,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
because they kind of 
get in the way of studying pure form.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
I was in a small restaurant in Spain,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
having lunch --

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
one of those nice days where

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
you had the place kind of to yourself,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and the culture and the food

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
and the quiet, and feeling very lucky,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
and a bus load of tourists arrived,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
emptied out,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
filled up the restaurant.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
In a very short period of time,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
completely changed the atmosphere

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
and character with loud voices and large bodies and such,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
and we had to get up and leave;

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
it was just that uncomfortable.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
And at that moment, the sun came out,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
and through this perforated screen,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
a pattern was cast over these bodies

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and they kind of faded into the rear,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
and we left the restaurant kind of

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
feeling O.K. about stuff.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
And I do think pattern

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
has the capability of eradicating

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
some of the most evil

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
forces of society,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
such as bad form in restaurants,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
but quite seriously, it was a statement to me

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
that one thing that you do, sort of, see

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
is the aggressive nature

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
of the industrial world has produced --

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
kind of,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
large masses of things,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
and when you -- in monoculture,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
and I think the preservation of diversity in culture

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
is something that's important to us.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
The last shots that I have deal with --

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
coming back to this theme of sidewalks,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and I wanted to

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
Post-Second World War,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
the influence of the automobile

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.330
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
in a sort of indiscriminate use.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
as it is on Wal-Mart;

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
I'm not going to do that.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
But they're real examples in urbanization

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
and the change that's occurred in the last number of years,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
and the heightened sensitivity to the importance

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
of our urban environments as cultural centers.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
I think that they are, that the statements that we make

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
in this public sector

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
are our contributions

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
to a larger whole.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
Cities are the place where we're most likely

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
to encounter diversity

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
and to mix with other people.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
But I think people have recognized

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
the sanctity of our urban areas.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
A place like Chicago

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
has really reached kind of a level of international stature.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
enlightened urban planning and renewal,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
and I want to single out a place like Chicago,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
for being able to work through the

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
political processes and all that to improve an area.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
You would expect a city like this to have

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
upgraded flower boxes

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
but if you actually go along the street you find

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
the flower boxes change from street to street:

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
there's actual diversity in the plants.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
And the idea that a city group can maintain

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
different types of foliage

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
is really quite exceptional.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
and then there are your big-D design statements:

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
My measure of this as being an important bit of design

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
is not so much the way that it looks,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
but the fact that it performs a very important social function.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
There are a lot of free concerts, for example,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
that go on in this area;

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
it has a phenomenal acoustic system.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
But the commitment that the city has made to the public area

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
is significant, and almost an international model.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
on the International Design Council for Mayors,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
I thought that I should include at least one

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
shot of technology for you guys.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
has created, kind of,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
a digital readout in this park

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
that reflects back

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
the characters and personalities

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
of the people in this area.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
reflective of diversity, and I think

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
this marriage of both technology and art

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
in the public sector is an area where the U.S.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
can really take a leadership role,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
and Chicago is one example.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
Thank you very much.
