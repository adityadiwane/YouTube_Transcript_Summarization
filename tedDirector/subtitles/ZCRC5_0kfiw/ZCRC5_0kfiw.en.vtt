00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.276
I think it's safe to say

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:18.260
that all humans will be intimate with death

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.100
at least once in their lives.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.117
But what if that intimacy began

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:25.406
long before you faced your own transition

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:28.200
from life into death?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.129
What would life be like

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.725
if the dead literally lived alongside you?

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.651
In my husband's homeland

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:38.331
in the highlands of Sulawesi island

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:40.358
in eastern Indonesia,

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:42.827
there is a community of people that experience death

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.448
not as a singular event

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:49.200
but as a gradual social process.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.997
In Tana Toraja,

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:54.035
the most important social moments in people's lives,

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.381
the focal points of social and cultural interaction

00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:02.096
are not weddings or births or even family dinners,

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:04.590
but funerals.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.919
So these funerals are characterized

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:08.830
by elaborate rituals

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.345
that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:14.482
based on the amount of animals --

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:19.476
pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo --

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:22.159
that are sacrificed and distributed

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.926
in the name of the deceased.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:28.663
So this cultural complex surrounding death,

00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:32.291
the ritual enactment of the end of life,

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.871
has made death the most visible

00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:39.700
and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.128
Lasting anywhere from a few days

00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:43.968
to a few weeks,

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:47.110
funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.152
where commemorating someone who's died

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:52.743
is not so much a private sadness

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:57.811
but more of a publicly shared transition.

00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.212
And it's a transition that's just as much

00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:02.414
about the identity of the living

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:06.227
as it is about remembrance of the dead.

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.721
So every year, thousands of visitors

00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.285
come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.349
this culture of death,

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.935
and for many people these grandiose ceremonies

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.693
and the length of the ceremonies

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:22.437
are somehow incommensurable

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:27.360
with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.274
So even as we share death as a universal experience,

00:02:33.274 --> 00:02:37.416
it's not experienced the same way the world over.

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:39.684
And as an anthropologist,

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:42.146
I see these differences in experience

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:46.895
being rooted in the cultural and social world

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:52.071
through which we define the phenomena around us.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.956
So where we see an unquestionable reality,

00:02:56.956 --> 00:03:01.879
death as an irrefutable biological condition,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.184
Torajans see the expired corporeal form

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:08.996
as part of a larger social genesis.

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:13.792
So again, the physical cessation of life

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.741
is not the same as death.

00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.324
In fact, a member of society is only truly dead

00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:23.758
when the extended family can agree upon

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:26.102
and marshal the resources necessary

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:27.888
to hold a funeral ceremony

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:31.540
that is considered appropriate in terms of resources

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.235
for the status of the deceased.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.507
And this ceremony has to take place

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.669
in front of the eyes of the whole community

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.276
with everyone's participation.

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:44.146
So after a person's physical death,

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:46.885
their body is placed in a special room

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:49.941
in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.

00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.089
And the tongkonan is symbolic

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.191
not only of the family's identity

00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:59.888
but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.

00:03:59.888 --> 00:04:01.787
So essentially, the shape of the building

00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:03.831
that you're born into is the shape

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.725
of the structure which carries you

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:09.421
to your ancestral resting place.

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.701
Until the funeral ceremony,

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:16.648
which can be held years after a person's physical death,

00:04:16.648 --> 00:04:22.363
the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:26.706
or "to mama," a person who is asleep,

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:30.489
and they continue to be a member of the household.

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:33.848
They are symbolically fed and cared for,

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:35.730
and the family at this time

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.643
will begin a number of ritual injunctions,

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:41.605
which communicates to the wider community around them

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:44.427
that one of their members is undergoing the transition

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:47.462
from this life into the afterlife

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.722
known as Puya.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.444
So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:55.220
Is she really saying that these people live

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.288
with the bodies of their dead relatives?

00:04:58.288 --> 00:05:01.360
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.840
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.378
we have to this idea of proximity to bodies,

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:10.512
proximity to death,

00:05:10.512 --> 00:05:13.032
or how this notion just does not fit

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:16.284
into our very biological or medical

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:19.088
sort of definition of death,

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:22.175
I like to think about what the Torajan way

00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:26.931
of viewing death encompasses of the human experience

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:31.964
that the medical definition leaves out.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:35.705
I think that Torajans socially recognize

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.835
and culturally express

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:41.297
what many of us feel to be true

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:43.721
despite the widespread acceptance

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:48.468
of the biomedical definition of death,

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:52.363
and that is that our relationships with other humans,

00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:55.869
their impact on our social reality,

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:58.345
doesn't cease with the termination

00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:02.326
of the physical processes of the body,

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:04.969
that there's a period of transition

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.190
as the relationship between the living and the dead

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.043
is transformed but not ended.

00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:18.881
So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship

00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:20.723
by lavishing love and attention

00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:23.993
on the most visible symbol of that relationship,

00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:25.770
the human body.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.594
So my husband has fond memories

00:06:28.594 --> 00:06:31.140
of talking to and playing with

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.601
and generally being around his deceased grandfather,

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.876
and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:40.805
This is a natural part of the process

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:44.274
as the family comes to terms with the transition

00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:46.966
in their relationship to the deceased,

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:49.455
and this is the transition from relating to the deceased

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.725
as a person who's living

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.627
to relating to the deceased

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:55.453
as a person who's an ancestor.

00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:57.638
And here you can see these wooden effigies

00:06:57.638 --> 00:06:58.841
of the ancestors,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:00.432
so these are people who have already been buried,

00:07:00.432 --> 00:07:01.898
already had a funeral ceremony.

00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:04.808
These are called tau tau.

00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:07.328
So the funeral ceremony itself

00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:11.224
embodies this relational perspective on death.

00:07:11.224 --> 00:07:15.607
It ritualizes the impact of death on families

00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:17.830
and communities.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.998
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.

00:07:20.998 --> 00:07:24.127
It's a moment when people think about who they are,

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:27.632
their place in society,

00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:29.935
and their role in the life cycle

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:34.128
in accordance with Torajan cosmology.

00:07:34.128 --> 00:07:35.782
There's a saying in Toraja

00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:38.916
that all people will become grandparents,

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.297
and what this means is that after death,

00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:44.146
we all become part of the ancestral line

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:47.954
that anchors us between the past and the present

00:07:47.954 --> 00:07:52.943
and will define who our loved ones are into the future.

00:07:52.943 --> 00:07:55.732
So essentially, we all become grandparents

00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:58.146
to the generations of human children

00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:01.160
that come after us.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.389
And this metaphor of membership

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:05.519
in the greater human family

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.364
is the way that children also describe

00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:08.942
the money that they invest

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:10.913
in these sacrificial buffaloes

00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:12.955
that are thought to carry people's soul

00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:15.125
from here to the afterlife,

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.711
and children will explain

00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:19.290
that they will invest the money in this

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.717
because they want to repay their parents

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:24.962
the debt for all of the years their parents spent

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:27.476
investing and caring for them.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:30.186
But the sacrifice of buffalo

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:32.873
and the ritual display of wealth

00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:35.928
also exhibits the status of the deceased,

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:39.220
and, by extension, the deceased's family.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.348
So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed

00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:45.661
but also transformed

00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:48.301
in a ritual drama that highlights

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:52.079
the most salient feature about death in this place:

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:57.345
its impact on life and the relationships of the living.

00:08:57.345 --> 00:09:00.160
So all of this focus on death

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.796
doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire

00:09:02.796 --> 00:09:05.472
to the ideal of a long life.

00:09:05.472 --> 00:09:07.541
They engage in many practices

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:09.669
thought to confer good health

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:12.533
and survival to an advanced age.

00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:14.700
But they don't put much stock

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.699
in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:22.354
or in old age.

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.217
It's said in Toraja that everybody has

00:09:24.217 --> 00:09:26.954
sort of a predetermined amount of life.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.932
It's called the sunga'.

00:09:28.932 --> 00:09:32.000
And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.940
to its natural end.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.488
So by having death as a part

00:09:37.488 --> 00:09:41.657
of the cultural and social fabric of life,

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:44.630
people's everyday decisions about their health

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.931
and healthcare are affected.

00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:51.058
The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.130
Nenet Katcha,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.783
is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:00.885
And there are increasing signs

00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:05.528
that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.

00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:10.459
And his death will be greatly mourned.

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.675
But I know that my husband's family

00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:14.893
looks forward to the moment

00:10:14.893 --> 00:10:18.550
when they can ritually display

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.283
what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,

00:10:23.283 --> 00:10:25.021
when they can ritually recount

00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:27.036
his life's narrative,

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.800
weaving his story

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.822
into the history of their community.

00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.654
His story is their story.

00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:42.426
His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:46.211
And it's a story that has no discernible beginning,

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:48.832
no foreseeable end.

00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:50.768
It's a story that goes on

00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:55.420
long after his body no longer does.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.940
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.660
by participating in a culture

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.331
where the physical manifestations of death

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.110
greet us at every turn.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.340
But I see something profoundly transformative

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.755
in experiencing death as a social process

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:17.011
and not just a biological one.

00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:21.075
In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead

00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:24.365
has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:26.908
where decisions about how long to stretch

00:11:26.908 --> 00:11:30.181
the thread of life are made based on our emotional

00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:32.806
and social ties with the people around us,

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:37.925
not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.

00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:40.650
We, like the Torajans,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.445
base our decisions about life

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:47.093
on the meanings and the definitions

00:11:47.093 --> 00:11:49.357
that we ascribe to death.

00:11:49.357 --> 00:11:52.900
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.132
should run out and adopt the traditions

00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:56.754
of the Torajans.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:58.346
It might be a little bit difficult

00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:01.680
to put into play in the United States.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.561
But I want to ask what we can gain

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:08.000
from seeing physical death not only as a biological process

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.492
but as part of the greater human story.

00:12:12.492 --> 00:12:15.023
What would it be like to look on

00:12:15.023 --> 00:12:18.472
the expired human form with love

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:22.196
because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?

00:12:22.196 --> 00:12:25.083
If we could expand our definition of death

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.494
to encompass life,

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:31.408
we could experience death as part of life

00:12:31.408 --> 00:12:33.670
and perhaps face death

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.133
with something other than fear.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.076
Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges

00:12:41.076 --> 00:12:43.929
that are facing the U.S. healthcare system,

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.355
particularly in the end-of-life care,

00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:49.385
is as simple as a shift in perspective,

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:51.402
and the shift in perspective in this case

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:57.030
would be to look at the social life of every death.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.515
It might help us recognize that the way we limit

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:02.191
our conversation about death

00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:05.226
to something that's medical or biological

00:13:05.226 --> 00:13:09.049
is reflective of a larger culture that we all share

00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:14.699
of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:19.139
If we could entertain and value

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:22.262
other kinds of knowledge about life,

00:13:22.262 --> 00:13:25.936
including other definitions of death,

00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:28.138
it has the potential to change the discussions

00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:31.885
that we have about the end of life.

00:13:31.885 --> 00:13:35.978
It could change the way that we die,

00:13:35.978 --> 00:13:37.990
but more importantly,

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:45.092
it could transform the way that we live.

00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:49.101
