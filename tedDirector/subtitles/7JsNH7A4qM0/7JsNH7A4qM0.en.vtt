00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Humans in the developed world

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
where they breathe in and come into contact

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
microorganisms.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Buildings are complex ecosystems

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that are an important source

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
of microbes that are good for us,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and some that are bad for us.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
What determines the types and distributions

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
of microbes indoors?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that enter through windows

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and through mechanical ventilation systems.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And they are brought inside

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
by humans and other creatures.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
The fate of microbes indoors

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
depends on complex interactions

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
with humans,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and with the human-built environment.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And today, architects and biologists

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
are working together

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
to explore smart building design

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that will create

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
healthy buildings for us.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We spend an extraordinary amount of time

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
in buildings

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that are extremely controlled environments,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
like this building here --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
environments that have mechanical ventilation systems

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that include filtering,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
heating and air conditioning.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
it's important to understand

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
how this affects our health.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
we carried out a study in a hospital

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
where we sampled air

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and pulled the DNA

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
out of microbes in the air.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And we looked at three different types of rooms.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
which are the data points in the blue.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in a wing of the building

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and pry open the windows

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
that were no longer operable,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
but they made them operable for our study.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And we also sampled the outdoor air.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
If you look at the x-axis of this graph,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
you'll see that what we commonly want to do --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
which is keeping the outdoors out --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So if you look at the green data points,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
which is air that's outside,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
or variety of microbial types.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
But if you look at the blue data points,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
which is mechanically ventilated air,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
it's not as diverse.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
But being less diverse

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
is not necessarily good for our health.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
If you look at the y-axis of this graph,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
you have a higher probability

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
of encountering a potential pathogen,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
or germ,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
than if you're outdoors.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So to understand why this was the case,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
we took our data

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and put it into an ordination diagram,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
which is a statistical map

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that tells you something

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
about how related the microbial communities are

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
in the different samples.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
The data points that are closer together

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
have microbial communities that are more similar

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
than data points that are far apart.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And the first things that you can see from this graph

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
is, if you look at the blue data points,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
which are the mechanically ventilated air,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
they're not simply a subset of the green data points,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
which are the outdoor air.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
looks like humans.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It has microbes on it

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
that are commonly associated with our skin

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and with our mouth, our spit.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And this is because

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
we're all constantly shedding microbes.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
So all of you right now

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
are sharing your microbes with one another.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And when you're outdoors,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that type of air has microbes

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Why does this matter?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
It matters because the health care industry

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is the second most energy intensive industry

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in the United States.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Hospitals use two and a half times

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the amount of energy as office buildings.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And the model that we're working with

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
in hospitals,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and also with many, many different buildings,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
is to keep the outdoors out.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And this model

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
may not necessarily be the best for our health.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And given the extraordinary amount

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
of nosocomial infections,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
or hospital-acquired infections,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
this is a clue that it's a good time

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
to reconsider our current practices.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So just as we manage national parks,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
where we promote the growth of some species

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and we inhibit the growth of others,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
we're working towards thinking about buildings

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
using an ecosystem framework

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
where we can promote the kinds of microbes

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that we want to have indoors.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I've heard somebody say

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that you're as healthy as your gut.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
so they can promote a healthy gut flora.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And what we ultimately want to do

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is to be able to use this concept

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
to promote a healthy group

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
of microorganisms inside.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Thank you.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
(Applause)
