00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What I'd like to start off with is an observation,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is that if I've learned anything over the last year,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's that the supreme irony

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of publishing a book about slowness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I seem to spend most of my time these days

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
zipping from city to city, studio to studio,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
interview to interview,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Because everyone these days

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
wants to know how to slow down,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so I did a spot on CNN the other day

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a world stuck in fast-forward.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
A world obsessed with speed,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
into less and less time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Every moment of the day feels like

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
a race against the clock.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"These days even instant gratification takes too long." (Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And even things that are by their very nature slow --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we try and speed them up too.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
who want to, you know, salute the sun,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and they're amusing and good to laugh at.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But there's a very serious point,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we often lose sight of the damage

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that this roadrunner form of living does to us.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We're so marinated in the culture of speed

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
on every aspect of our lives --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
on our health, our diet, our work,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
our relationships, the environment and our community.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And sometimes it takes

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
a wake-up call, doesn't it,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
instead of actually living them; that we're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
living the fast life, instead of the good life.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And I think for many people, that wake-up call

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
takes the form of an illness.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
"I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because we haven't had the time, or the patience,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
or the tranquility,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to be with the other person, to listen to them.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And my wake-up call came when I started

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
reading bedtime stories to my son,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I found that at the end of day,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the most tender moment of the day,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
when a dad sits down to read to his son,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a clash between my speed

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and his slowness.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And this went on for some time,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
with timesaving tips for fast people.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And one of them made reference to a series of books called

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
"The One-Minute Bedtime Story."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And I wince saying those words now,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but my first reaction at the time was very different.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
My first reflex was to say,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"Hallelujah -- what a great idea!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But thankfully,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and I took a step back, and I thought,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And I put away the newspaper --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And I had two questions in my head.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The first was, how did we get so fast?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And the second is, is it possible,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
or even desirable, to slow down?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now, if you think about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You think of, you know, urbanization,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
consumerism, the workplace, technology.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But I think if you cut through

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
those forces, you get to what might be the deeper

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
driver, the nub of the question,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
which is how we think about time itself.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
In other cultures, time is cyclical.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's seen as moving in great,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
unhurried circles.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Whereas in the West, time is linear.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It's a finite resource;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
it's always draining away.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You either use it, or lose it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I think what that does to us psychologically

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is it creates an equation.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Time is scarce, so what do we do?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We try and do more and more with less and less time.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We turn every moment of every day

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
into a race to the finish line --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
but a finish line nonetheless.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I guess that the question is,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
is it possible to break free from that mindset?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
a global backlash against this culture that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable:

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
they're slowing down, and finding that,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the opposite turns out to be true:

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that by slowing down at the right moments,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
people find that they do everything better.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
they work better; they live better.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And, in this kind of cauldron

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of moments and places and acts of deceleration,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
lie what a lot of people now refer to as

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the "International Slow Movement."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I'll just give you a very quick overview of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and now has 100,000 members

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in 50 countries.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which is that we get more pleasure and more health

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
from our food when we

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I think also the explosion of

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
are other illustrations

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of the fact that people are desperate to get away from

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
eating and cooking and cultivating their food

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on an industrial timetable.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
They want to get back to slower rhythms.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but has spread right across Europe and beyond.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And in this, towns

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
so that people are encouraged to slow down

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and smell the roses and connect with one another.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So they might curb traffic,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
or put in a park bench, or some green space.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that we believe that in the 21st century,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with the kind of quick-fix mentality

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you find in conventional medicine.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And millions of them around the world are turning

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to complementary and alternative forms of medicine,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which tend to tap into sort of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and I personally doubt that the coffee enema

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But other treatments

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
clearly have some kind of benefit.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
are starting to study these things to find out how they work,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and what we might learn from them.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I was coming to --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
well -- no pun intended there.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
a men's magazine, and it said on the front,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So, you know, even sex

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
is on a stopwatch these days.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, you know,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I like a quickie as much as the next person,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, we all laughed at Sting

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a few years ago when he went Tantric,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
flocking to workshops, or maybe just

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to put on the brakes and have better sex.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
where to find their pleasure --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The workplace.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Right across much of the world --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
North America being a notable exception --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
working hours have been coming down.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And Europe is an example of that,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and people finding that their quality of life improves

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
as they're working less, and also

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that their hourly productivity goes up.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Now, clearly there are problems with

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the 35-hour workweek in France --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
too much, too soon, too rigid.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
are showing that it's possible

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
to have a kick-ass economy

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
without being a workaholic.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And Norway, Sweden,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Denmark and Finland now rank

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
among the top six most competitive nations on Earth,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
weep with envy.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And if you go beyond sort of the country level,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
down at the micro-company level,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
more and more companies now are realizing

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that they need to allow their staff

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
either to work fewer hours or just to unplug --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
mobile phones,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and for the brain to slide into that

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
kind of creative mode of thought.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's not just, though, these days,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
race around with more homework,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
more tutoring, more extracurriculars

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And some of the most heartrending emails

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that I get on my website

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
are actually from adolescents

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to write to their parents,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to help them slow down, to help them get off this

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
full-throttle treadmill.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
are now banding together and banning extracurriculars

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
on a particular day of the month, so that people can,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
springing up all over the developed world

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
in schools which had been piling on the homework for years,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and now they're discovering that less can be more.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So there was a case up in Scotland recently

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
banned homework

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
for everyone under the age of 13,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
"What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And just this last month, the exam results came in,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
on average last year.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And I think what's very revealing is that

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
are starting to notice the caliber of students

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
to the point that would make your eyes water.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But they lack spark; they lack

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
the ability to think creatively and think outside --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
if they put on the brakes, if they do less,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but give time to things, the time that things need,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to enjoy them, to savor them.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
"Slow Down!" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same:

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that less is very often more,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that slower is very often

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
better. But that said, of course,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
it's not that easy to slow down, is it?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and that's true, but that's not all of it.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I was actually en route to a dinner

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
held by Slow Food at the time.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
(Laughter)

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But why is it so hard to slow down?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I think there are various reasons.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
from the bigger, deeper questions.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
so that we don't have to ask,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that we've erected against slowing down.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker,"

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
for being somebody who gives up.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
with being stupid.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and to say that yes,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
sometimes slow is not the answer,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that there is such a thing as "bad slow."

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You know, I got stuck on the M25,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
which is a ring road around London, recently,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
that's really bad slow.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
But the new idea,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And good slow is, you know, taking the time

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
in the office to make the best decision

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
at work.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Or even simply just taking the time

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to slow down

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and savor your life.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
about all of this stuff that's happened around the book

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
since it came out, is the reaction to it.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
but it's also been taken up, with great gusto,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
by the corporate world -- you know,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
business press, but also

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
big companies and leadership organizations.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
are starting to realize that there's too much

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
speed in the system,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
there's too much busyness, and it's time to find,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Another encouraging sign, I think,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
is that it's not just in the developed world

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
in countries that are on the verge of making that leap

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
into first world status -- China, Brazil,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Thailand, Poland, and so on --

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
many people in them, and there's a debate going on

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in their media, on the streets.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but we're not so sure about that."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So all of that said, is it,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I guess, is it possible?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
to slow down? And

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I'm happy to be able to say to you

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
that the answer is a resounding yes.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And I present myself as Exhibit A,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
a kind of reformed and rehabilitated

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
speed-aholic.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I still love speed. You know, I live in London,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and I work as a journalist,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I play squash and ice hockey,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
But I've also, over the last year or so,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
got in touch with my inner tortoise.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
(Laughter)

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And what that means is that

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I no longer

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
overload myself gratuitously.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
My default mode is no longer

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
to be a rush-aholic.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I no longer hear

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
time's winged chariot drawing near,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
or at least not as much as I did before.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And the upshot of all of that is that

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I actually feel a lot happier, healthier,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
more productive than I ever have.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I feel like I'm living

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
my life rather than actually just racing through it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And perhaps, the most important

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
measure of the success of this

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
richer, stronger.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And for me, I guess, the litmus test

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
for whether this would work, and what it would mean,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
the journey began. And there too the news is

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
rosy. You know,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and I just slow down to his pace and we read.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
they don't do quality time,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
They need you to move at their rhythm.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
my son will suddenly say, "You know,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And I now find that bedtime stories

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
used to be

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
It's become my reward at the end of the day,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
something I really cherish.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
to my talk this afternoon,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
which goes a little bit like this:

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
another book tour, and I had my bags packed.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and my son came down the stairs and

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and put a sticker of his favorite

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
character, Tintin, on the front.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And he said to me,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
or he handed this to me, and I read it,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
for being the best story reader in the world."

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Thank you very much.
