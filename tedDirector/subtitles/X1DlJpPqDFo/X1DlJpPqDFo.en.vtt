00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.320
For the past decade,

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:17.246
I've been studying non-state armed groups:

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.137
armed organizations like terrorists,
insurgents or militias.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.761
I document what these groups do
when they're not shooting.

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:28.348
My goal is to better understand
these violent actors

00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:32.062
and to study ways to encourage transition
from violent engagement

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:33.963
to nonviolent confrontation.

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:37.391
I work in the field, in the policy world
and in the library.

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:42.860
Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.440
because war has changed.

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:46.924
It used to be a contest between states.

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:48.719
No longer.

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:52.681
It is now a conflict between states
and non-state actors.

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.972
For example, of the 216 peace agreements

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:00.406
signed between 1975 and 2011,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.610
196 of them were between a state
and a non-state actor.

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.871
So we need to understand these groups;
we need to either engage them

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:13.784
or defeat them in any conflict resolution
process that has to be successful.

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:15.222
So how do we do that?

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.809
We need to know what makes
these organizations tick.

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:21.941
We know a lot about
how they fight, why they fight,

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.019
but no one looks at what they're doing
when they're not fighting.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:28.635
Yet, armed struggle
and unarmed politics are related.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.957
It is all part of the same organization.

00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:34.138
We cannot understand these groups,
let alone defeat them,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.050
if we don't have the full picture.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.198
And armed groups today
are complex organizations.

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:42.125
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.932
known for its violent
confrontation against Israel.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:47.791
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:50.400
Hezbollah has also set up
a political party,

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:53.741
a social-service network,
and a military apparatus.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:56.391
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.982
known for its suicide attacks
against Israel,

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.210
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:04.912
So these groups do way more
than just shoot.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:06.612
They multi-task.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.254
They set up complex
communication machines --

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:12.421
radio stations, TV channels,

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.398
Internet websites
and social media strategies.

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:17.714
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.863
printed in English
and published to recruit.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.166
Armed groups also invest
in complex fund-raising --

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.053
not looting, but setting up
profitable businesses;

00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:30.467
for example, construction companies.

00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:32.374
Now, these activities are keys.

00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:34.818
They allow these groups
to increase their strength,

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.197
increase their funds,

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.093
to better recruit
and to build their brand.

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:41.276
Armed groups also do something else:

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960
they build stronger bonds
with the population

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:46.433
by investing in social services.

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:49.300
They build schools, they run hospitals,

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.080
they set up vocational-training programs
or micro-loan programs.

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:56.881
Hezbollah offers all
of these services and more.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.714
Armed groups also seek
to win the population over

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:03.638
by offering something
that the state is not providing:

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:05.713
safety and security.

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:10.101
The initial rise of the Taliban
in war-torn Afghanistan,

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:13.002
or even the beginning
of the ascent of ISIS,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.084
can be understood also by looking
at these groups' efforts

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.324
to provide security.

00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:20.619
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:23.889
the provision of security
came at an unbearably high price

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:25.323
for the population.

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:29.588
But in general, providing
social services fills a gap,

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:31.873
a governance gap left by the government,

00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:34.492
and allows these groups
to increase their strength

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:35.714
and their power.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.446
For example, the 2006 electoral victory
of the Palestinian Hamas

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.049
cannot be understood without
acknowledging the group's social work.

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:47.070
Now, this is a really complex picture,

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.571
yet in the West,
when we look at armed groups,

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.797
we only think of the violent side.

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.693
But that's not enough to understand
these groups' strength,

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:56.979
strategy or long-term vision.

00:03:57.393 --> 00:03:58.953
These groups are hybrid.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:02.301
They rise because they fill a gap
left by the government,

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.705
and they emerge
to be both armed and political,

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.949
engage in violent struggle
and provide governance.

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.439
And the more these organizations
are complex and sophisticated,

00:04:13.463 --> 00:04:16.804
the less we can think of them
as the opposite of a state.

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:19.107
Now, what do you call
a group like Hezbollah?

00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:22.446
They run part of a territory,
they administer all their functions,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.604
they pick up the garbage,
they run the sewage system.

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:28.339
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.057
Or maybe something else,
something different and new?

00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.762
And what about ISIS?

00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:35.056
The lines are blurred.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.838
We live in a world of states,
non-states, and in-between,

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.275
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:45.775
the more non-state actors
step in and fill that gap.

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:48.925
This matters for governments,
because to counter these groups,

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.399
they will have to invest more
in non-military tools.

00:04:53.202 --> 00:04:54.673
Filling that governance gap

00:04:54.697 --> 00:04:58.126
has to be at the center
of any sustainable approach.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.789
This also matters very much
for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:03.844
If we better understand armed groups,

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.330
we will better know
what incentives to offer

00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:10.130
to encourage the transition
from violence to nonviolence.

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:14.131
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,

00:05:14.155 --> 00:05:16.807
military power can win some battles,

00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:19.664
but it will not give us
peace nor stability.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.933
To achieve these objectives,

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:26.762
what we need is a long-term investment
in filling that security gap,

00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:28.787
in filling that governance gap

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:31.902
that allowed these groups
to thrive in the first place.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.371
Thank you.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:36.952
(Applause)
