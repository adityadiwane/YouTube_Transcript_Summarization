00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
As a clergyman,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
you can imagine how

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
out of place I feel.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
I feel like a fish out of water,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
or maybe an owl out of the air.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
(Laughter)

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
I was preaching in San Jose some time ago,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and my friend Mark Kvamme,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
who helped introduce me

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
to this conference,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
brought several CEOs

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
and leaders

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
to have breakfast with me, or I with them.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And I was so stimulated.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
And had such -- it was an

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
eye-opening experience

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
to hear them talk about

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
the world that is yet to come

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
through technology

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
and science.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
I know that we're near the end of this conference,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and some of you may be wondering

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
why they have a speaker

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
from the field of religion.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Richard can answer that,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
because he made that decision.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
coming down.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
I was to address a conference

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
at a hotel.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And on that elevator a man said,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And another man looked in my direction and said,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And this man looked me up and down

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
for about 10 seconds,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
(Laughter)

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
I hope

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
that you won't feel that these few moments with me

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
is not a -- is an anticlimax,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
after all these tremendous

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
talks that you've heard,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
But I was

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
on an airplane in the east some years ago,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and the man sitting across the aisle from me

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And there was a drunk man on there,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and he got up out of his seat two or three times,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
and he was making everybody upset

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
by what he was trying to do.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And he was slapping the stewardess

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
and pinching her as she went by,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
and everybody was upset with him.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And finally, John Belk said,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
"Do you know who's sitting here?"

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And the man said, "No, who?"

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
He said, "It's Billy Graham,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
the preacher."

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
He said, "You don't say!"

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.160
(Laughter)

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And I suppose that that's true

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
with thousands of people.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.160
(Laughter)

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
I know that as you have been peering into the future,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and as we've heard some of it here tonight,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
I would like to live in that age

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
and see what is going to be.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
But I won't,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
and I know that my time is brief.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
because I have Parkinson's disease

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
in addition to that,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
and some other problems that I won't talk about.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
(Laughter)

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
But this is not the first time

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
that we've had a technological revolution.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
We've had others.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And there's one that I want to talk about.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
In one generation,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
the nation of the people of Israel

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
had a tremendous and dramatic change

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
that made them a great power in the Near East.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
A man by the name of David

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
came to the throne,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and King David became one of the great leaders

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
of his generation.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
He was a man of tremendous leadership.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
He had the favor of God with him.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
He was a brilliant poet,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
philosopher, writer, soldier --

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
with strategies in battle and conflict

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
that people study even today.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
But about two centuries before David,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
the Hittites

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
had discovered the secret

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
of smelting and processing of iron,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
and, slowly, that skill spread.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
But they wouldn't allow the Israelis

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
to look into it, or to have any.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
But David changed all of that,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
and he introduced the Iron Age

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
to Israel.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
and which archaeologists have found,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
that in present-day Palestine,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
there are evidences of that generation.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Now, instead of crude tools

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
made of sticks and stones,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
Israel now had iron plows,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
and sickles, and hoes

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
and military weapons.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
And in the course of one generation,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Israel was completely changed.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
The introduction of iron, in some ways,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
had an impact

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
a little bit like the microchip

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
has had on our generation.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
David found

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
that there were many problems that technology could not solve.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
There were many problems still left.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
How do we solve these three problems

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
that I'd like to mention?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
The first one that David saw

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
was human evil.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Where does it come from?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
How do we solve it?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Over again and again

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
in the Psalms,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
David describes the evils of the human race.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
And yet he says,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
"He restores my soul."

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.160
On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
as this conference vividly demonstrates.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
We've seen under the sea,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
three miles down,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
or galaxies hundreds of billions of years

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
out in the future.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
But on the other hand,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
something is wrong.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Our battleships,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
our soldiers,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
are on a frontier now,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
almost ready to go to war

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
with Iraq.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
Now, what causes this?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Why do we have these wars in every generation,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
and in every part of the world?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And revolutions?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
We can't get along with other people,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
even in our own families.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
of self-destructive habits we can't break.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
Even the most sophisticated among us

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
seem powerless to break this cycle.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
I would like to see Oracle

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
take up that,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
or

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
some other

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.160
technological geniuses work on this.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
How do we change man,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
so that he doesn't lie and cheat,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
and our newspapers are not filled with stories

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
of fraud in business or labor

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
or athletics or wherever?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
The Bible says the problem is within us,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
within our hearts and our souls.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Our problem is that we are separated

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
from our Creator,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
which we call God,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
and we need to have our souls restored,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
something only God can do.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Jesus said, "For out of the heart

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
come evil thoughts:

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
murders, sexual immorality,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
theft, false testimonies,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
slander."

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
was not a religious man,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
and it's from our hearts

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
that it must be plucked out."

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
Albert Einstein --

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and I met

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Mr. Einstein.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
nobody was qualified to give him one.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
(Laughter)

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
But he made this statement.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
than to denature the evil spirit of man."

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
And many of you, I'm sure,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
have thought about that

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and puzzled over it.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
You've seen people

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
take beneficial technological advances,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
such as the Internet we've heard about tonight,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
and twist them into something corrupting.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
that bring down whole systems.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
horribly used.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
The problem is not technology.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.160
The problem is the person or persons using it.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
King David said

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
that he knew the depths of his own soul.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
He couldn't free himself from personal problems

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and personal evils

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
that included murder and adultery.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
Yet King David sought God's forgiveness,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and said, "You can restore my soul."

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
You see, the Bible teaches

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
that we're more than a body and a mind.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
We are a soul.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
And there's something inside of us

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
that is beyond our understanding.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
That's the part of us that yearns

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
for God, or something more

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
than we find in technology.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Your soul is that part of you that

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
yearns for meaning in life,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
and which seeks for something beyond this life.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
I find [that] young people all over the world

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
are searching for something.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
and I have many questions and answer periods, and

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
or Oxford --

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
I've spoken at all of those universities.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four --

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
no, it's about two months from now --

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
to give a lecture.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
the last few times I've been there.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
And it'll be on

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
these questions:

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
What's life all about? Why am I here?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
Even if you have no religious belief,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
there are times when you wonder that there's something else.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
Thomas Edison also said,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
and in the working of the universe,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
I remember once,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
at a White House dinner.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
and I said,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
What shall I talk to her about?"

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And he surprised me with the answer.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
That's what she's really interested in."

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
that's what we talked about,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
and it was a stimulating conversation.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And afterward, she said,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
"You know, I'm an atheist,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
but I know that there's something up there

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
higher than we are."

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
The second problem

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
that King David realized he could not solve

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
was the problem of human suffering.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
and he said,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
certain types of human suffering.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
But I'm --

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
I admit that I'm very grateful

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
for all the medical advances

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
that have kept me in relatively good health

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
all these years.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
And when you speak as much as I do,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
three or four times a day,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
you get rusty.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
That's the reason I'm using this podium

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
and using these notes.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
I'm ad-libbing.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
I'm not reading. I never read an address.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
I talk ad lib.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
But tonight, I've

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
got some notes here so that if

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
I begin to forget,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
which I do sometimes,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
I've got something I can turn to.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
But even here among us,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
most --

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
in the most advanced society in the world,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
we have poverty.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
We have families that self-destruct,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
friends that betray us.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
I've never met a person in the world

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
that didn't have a problem

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160
or a worry.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
that we haven't answered.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
Yet David again and again said

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
that he would turn to God.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
The final problem that David knew he could not solve

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
was death.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
Many commentators have said that death

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
is the forbidden subject of our generation.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Most people live as if

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
they're never going to die.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
Technology projects the myth

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
of control over our mortality.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
We see people on our screens.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
as she was in person,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
and our -- many young people think she's still alive.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
They don't know that she's dead.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.160
The old stars, they come to life.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
And they're --

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
But death is inevitable.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.160
I spoke some time ago to

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
a joint session of Congress, last year.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
And we were meeting in that room,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
the statue room.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
About 300 of them were there.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
or whoever."

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
I said, "We're all going to die.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160
And we have that in common with all these great men of the past

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
that are staring down at us."

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
And it's often difficult for young people

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160
to understand that.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160
As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
he said, there's every activity under heaven.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160
There's a time to be born,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
and there's a time to die.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
I've stood at the deathbed

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
of several famous people,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
whom you would know.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
I've talked to them.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
I've seen them in those agonizing moments

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
when they were scared to death.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
And yet, a few years earlier,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
death never crossed their mind.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
I talked to a woman this past week

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
whose father

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
was a famous doctor.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.160
didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
But she said,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
as he came to die,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.160
he sat up on the side of the bed one day,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.160
and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
And he said, for the first time in his life

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.160
he'd thought about the inevitable,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
and about God.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Was there a God?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
A few years ago, a university student asked me,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.160
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.160
is the brevity of life.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160
It passes so fast."

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
But it does not need to have to be that way.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.160
Wernher von Braun,

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.160
in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
"science and religion are not antagonists.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.160
On the contrary, they're sisters."

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
He put it on a personal basis.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
And he said, "Speaking for myself,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.160
I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.160
serves only to confirm

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.160
a belief in the certainty of a creator."

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160
He also said,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160
"In our search to know God,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.160
should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.160
The reality of this life and His resurrection

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.160
is the hope of mankind."

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
and in France, and in different parts of the world --

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.160
105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
And I was invited one day to visit

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
Chancellor Adenauer,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.160
who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.160
since the war.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
And he once -- and he said to me,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160
he said, "Young man." He said,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.160
And I said, "Sir, I do."

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.160
He said, "So do I."

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160
He said, "When I leave office,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.160
I'm going to spend my time writing a book

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.160
on why Jesus Christ rose again,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
and why it's so important to believe that."

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160
In one of his plays,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160
Alexander Solzhenitsyn

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.160
depicts a man dying,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.160
who says to those gathered around his bed,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.160
"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.160
is when one is dying."

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.160
How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
Blaise Pascal

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
asked exactly that question

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.160
in seventeenth-century France.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160
Pascal has been called the architect

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.160
of modern civilization.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
He was a brilliant scientist

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160
at the frontiers of mathematics,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160
even as a teenager.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.160
He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.160
and a creator of the first model of a computer.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.160
And of course, you are all familiar with

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.160
the computer language named for him.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.160
Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.160
of evil, suffering and death.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160
He was astounded

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160
at the phenomenon we've been considering:

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160
that people can achieve extraordinary heights

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160
in science, the arts and human enterprise,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.160
yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.160
and have -- and self-hatreds.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160
of genius and self-delusion.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160
On November 23,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160
1654,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
Pascal had a profound religious experience.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.160
He wrote in his journal these words:

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160
"I submit myself,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
absolutely,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160
to Jesus Christ, my redeemer."

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.160
A French historian said,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.160
two centuries later,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.160
"Seldom has so mighty an intellect

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160
submitted with such humility

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.160
to the authority of Jesus Christ."

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.160
Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.160
could bring us back into harmony,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
but he believed

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.160
that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.160
and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
He experienced it in a way that went beyond

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
scientific observation and reason.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.160
It was he who penned the well-known words,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
"The heart has its reasons,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
which reason knows not of."

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.160
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.160
Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
and open yourself to his love,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.160
you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.160
But if instead you bet that there is no God,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.160
then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
For Pascal, scientific knowledge

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.160
paled beside the knowledge of God.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
The knowledge of God was far beyond

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160
anything that ever crossed his mind.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160
He was ready to face him

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.160
when he died at the age of 39.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160
King David lived to be 70,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.160
a long time in his era.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.160
Yet he too had to face death,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.160
and he wrote these words:

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.160
"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.160
I will fear no evil,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.160
for you are with me."

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.160
This was David's answer to three dilemmas

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.160
of evil, suffering and death.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.160
It can be yours, as well,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
as you seek the living God

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.160
and allow him to fill your life

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.160
and give you hope for the future.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.160
When I was 17 years of age,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.160
I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160
I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160
when I came home from school.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.160
And there were 20 of them that I had --

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.160
that I was responsible for,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.160
and I worked on the farm

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.160
and tried to keep up with my studies.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.160
I didn't make good grades in high school.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.160
I didn't make them in college, until

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.160
something happened in my heart.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.160
One day, I was faced face-to-face

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.160
with Christ.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.160
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.160
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.160
I'm the embodiment of all truth."

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.160
He was a liar.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160
Or he was insane.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160
Or he was what he claimed to be.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.160
Which was he?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.160
I had to make that decision.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.160
I couldn't prove it.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.160
I couldn't take it to a laboratory

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160
and experiment with it.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160
But by faith I said, I believe him,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.160
and he came into my heart

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.160
and changed my life.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.160
And now I'm ready,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.160
when I hear that call,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.160
to go into the presence of God.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.160
Thank you, and God bless all of you.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:53.160
(Applause)

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.160
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.160
Richard Wurman: You did it.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160
Thanks.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:15.160
(Applause)
