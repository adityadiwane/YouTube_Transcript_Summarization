00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.649
I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.823
and its relationship with technology.

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:21.718
We tend to think of business strategy

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.681
as being a rather abstract body

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.396
of essentially economic thought,

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.026
perhaps rather timeless.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.966
I'm going to argue that, in fact,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.521
business strategy has always been premised

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.940
on assumptions about technology,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.913
that those assumptions are changing,

00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:38.630
and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.702
and that therefore what that will drive us to

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.605
is a different concept of what we mean

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:47.043
by business strategy.

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:48.524
Let me start, if I may,

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.294
with a little bit of history.

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:53.038
The idea of strategy in business

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:56.338
owes its origins to two intellectual giants:

00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:58.472
Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:02.244
and Michael Porter, professor
at the Harvard Business School.

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:05.076
Henderson's central idea was what you might call

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:08.067
the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.936
against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.729
What Henderson recognized was that,

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.125
in the business world,

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.780
there are many phenomena which are characterized

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.815
by what economists would call increasing returns --

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:20.178
scale, experience.

00:01:20.178 --> 00:01:22.052
The more you do of something,

00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:24.449
disproportionately the better you get.

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.412
And therefore he found a logic for investing

00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:30.154
in such kinds of overwhelming mass

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:32.707
in order to achieve competitive advantage.

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:34.775
And that was the first introduction

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:37.439
of essentially a military concept of strategy

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.421
into the business world.

00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:43.156
Porter agreed with that premise,

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:44.707
but he qualified it.

00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:47.696
He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:51.571
but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.144
They have different components,

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.676
and each of those components might be driven

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.461
by a different kind of strategy.

00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:59.789
A company or a business
might actually be advantaged

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.267
in some activities but disadvantaged in others.

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.368
He formed the concept of the value chain,

00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:08.438
essentially the sequence of steps with which

00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:11.590
a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.953
becomes assembled into a finished product,

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:15.594
and then is distributed, for example,

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.010
and he argued that advantage accrued

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.551
to each of those components,

00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.265
and that the advantage of the whole

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:23.396
was in some sense the sum or the average

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.744
of that of its parts.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:28.321
And this idea of the value chain was predicated

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.889
on the recognition that

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.535
what holds a business together is transaction costs,

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:36.830
that in essence you need to coordinate,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.405
organizations are more efficient at coordination

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:41.067
than markets, very often,

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:44.123
and therefore the nature and role and boundaries

00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:47.962
of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:50.526
It was on those two ideas,

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:53.912
Henderson's idea of increasing returns

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:55.460
to scale and experience,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.883
and Porter's idea of the value chain,

00:02:57.883 --> 00:02:59.796
encompassing heterogenous elements,

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:03.131
that the whole edifice of business strategy

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.908
was subsequently erected.

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:08.337
Now what I'm going to argue is

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:14.051
that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.605
First of all, let's think about transaction costs.

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:19.002
There are really two components
to transaction costs.

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.872
One is about processing information,
and the other is about communication.

00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:25.153
These are the economics of
processing and communicating

00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:27.627
as they have evolved over a long period of time.

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:30.637
As we all know from so many contexts,

00:03:30.637 --> 00:03:32.893
they have been radically transformed

00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:35.205
since the days when Porter and Henderson

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:37.299
first formulated their theories.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.365
In particular, since the mid-'90s,

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.233
communications costs have actually been falling

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.224
even faster than transaction costs,

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.783
which is why communication, the Internet,

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:50.398
has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.

00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:52.568
Now, those falling transaction costs

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:54.544
have profound consequences,

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.337
because if transaction costs are the glue

00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:58.759
that hold value chains together, and they are falling,

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.401
there is less to economize on.

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.333
There is less need for vertically
integrated organization,

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.211
and value chains at least can break up.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.710
They needn't necessarily, but they can.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.850
In particular, it then becomes possible for

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.616
a competitor in one business

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:15.941
to use their position in one step of the value chain

00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.773
in order to penetrate or attack

00:04:17.773 --> 00:04:20.937
or disintermediate the competitor in another.

00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:23.598
That is not just an abstract proposition.

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:25.277
There are many very specific stories

00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:27.049
of how that actually happened.

00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:30.542
A poster child example was
the encyclopedia business.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:31.991
The encyclopedia business

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.093
in the days of leatherbound books

00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:35.797
was basically a distribution business.

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:38.251
Most of the cost was the
commission to the salesmen.

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.877
The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,

00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:44.293
new technologies made the distribution of knowledge

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:46.572
many orders of magnitude cheaper,

00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:49.286
and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:52.118
It's now, of course, a very familiar story.

00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.160
This, in fact, more generally was the story

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.669
of the first generation of the Internet economy.

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.869
It was about falling transaction costs

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:00.344
breaking up value chains

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.973
and therefore allowing disintermediation,

00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:05.310
or what we call deconstruction.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.627
One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:10.143
well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.794
when Britannica no longer has a business model?

00:05:12.794 --> 00:05:14.960
And it was a while before
the answer became manifest.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.747
Now, of course, we know
what it is: it's the Wikipedia.

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:20.970
Now what's special about the
Wikipedia is not its distribution.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.374
What's special about the Wikipedia
is the way it's produced.

00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:25.614
The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia

00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:28.141
created by its users.

00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.021
And this, in fact, defines what you might call

00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:32.509
the second decade of the Internet economy,

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.869
the decade in which the Internet as a noun

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.776
became the Internet as a verb.

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.645
It became a set of conversations,

00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:43.721
the era in which user-generated
content and social networks

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.412
became the dominant phenomenon.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.310
Now what that really meant

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.684
in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:55.075
was the collapse of certain
kinds of economies of scale.

00:05:55.075 --> 00:05:57.413
It turned out that tens of thousands

00:05:57.413 --> 00:06:00.496
of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia

00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:02.042
could do just as good a job,

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:03.733
and certainly a much cheaper job,

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:06.712
than professionals in a hierarchical organization.

00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:09.169
So basically what was happening was that one layer

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.063
of this value chain was becoming fragmented,

00:06:12.063 --> 00:06:13.907
as individuals could take over

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:17.194
where organizations were no longer needed.

00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:19.826
But there's another question
that obviously this graph poses,

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:22.109
which is, okay, we've
gone through two decades --

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:24.787
does anything distinguish the third?

00:06:24.787 --> 00:06:26.902
And what I'm going to argue is that indeed

00:06:26.902 --> 00:06:28.407
something does distinguish the third,

00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:30.853
and it maps exactly on to the kind of

00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:33.321
Porter-Henderson logic that
we've been talking about.

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.908
And that is, about data.

00:06:35.908 --> 00:06:37.577
If we go back to around 2000,

00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:39.936
a lot of people were talking
about the information revolution,

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.237
and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:44.511
was growing, indeed growing quite fast.

00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.369
but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:49.187
We go forward to 2007,

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:52.372
not only had the world's stock of data exploded,

00:06:52.372 --> 00:06:54.892
but there'd been this massive substitution

00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:56.907
of digital for analog.

00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:58.776
And more important even than that,

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:00.516
if you look more carefully at this graph,

00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.536
what you will observe is that about a half

00:07:02.536 --> 00:07:04.150
of that digital data

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.536
is information that has an I.P. address.

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:09.387
It's on a server or it's on a P.C.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.194
But having an I.P. address means that it

00:07:11.194 --> 00:07:13.364
can be connected to any other data

00:07:13.364 --> 00:07:15.227
that has an I.P. address.

00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:16.873
It means it becomes possible

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.960
to put together half of the world's knowledge

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.612
in order to see patterns,

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:23.969
an entirely new thing.

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:25.937
If we run the numbers forward to today,

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:27.363
it probably looks something like this.

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.531
We're not really sure.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.559
If we run the numbers forward to 2020,

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.459
we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:37.799
It's curious that the future is so much
more predictable than the present.

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:42.194
And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:45.167
in the stock of information that is connected

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.395
via an I.P. address.

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:50.856
Now, if the number of connections that we can make

00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:53.996
is proportional to the number of pairs of data points,

00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:56.459
a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.562
is a ten-thousandfold multiplication

00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:00.127
in the number of patterns

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.204
that we can see in that data,

00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:04.864
this just in the last 10 or 11 years.

00:08:04.864 --> 00:08:07.688
This, I would submit, is a sea change,

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:09.772
a profound change in the economics

00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:11.723
of the world that we live in.

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:12.887
The first human genome,

00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:14.453
that of James Watson,

00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:18.373
was mapped as the culmination of the
Human Genome Project in the year 2000,

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.550
and it took about 200 million dollars

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.531
and about 10 years of work to map

00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:24.946
just one person's genomic makeup.

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:27.551
Since then, the costs of mapping
the genome have come down.

00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:29.438
In fact, they've come down in recent years

00:08:29.438 --> 00:08:31.112
very dramatically indeed,

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.558
to the point where the cost 
is now below 1,000 dollars,

00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:36.509
and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:38.240
it will be below 100 dollars --

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.436
a five or six order of magnitude drop

00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:43.381
in the cost of genomic mapping

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:45.804
in just a 15-year period,

00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:48.199
an extraordinary phenomenon.

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:52.604
Now, in the days when mapping a genome

00:08:52.604 --> 00:08:55.613
cost millions, or even tens of thousands,

00:08:55.613 --> 00:08:57.591
it was basically a research enterprise.

00:08:57.591 --> 00:09:00.133
Scientists would gather some representative people,

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:01.347
and they would see patterns, and they would try

00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:04.237
and make generalizations about
human nature and disease

00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:05.828
from the abstract patterns they find

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:09.288
from these particular selected individuals.

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:12.121
But when the genome can 
be mapped for 100 bucks,

00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:14.469
99 dollars while you wait,

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:16.659
then what happens is, it becomes retail.

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:18.516
It becomes above all clinical.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.728
You go the doctor with a cold,

00:09:19.728 --> 00:09:21.662
and if he or she hasn't done it already,

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.900
the first thing they do is map your genome,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.555
at which point what they're now doing

00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:30.084
is not starting from some abstract 
knowledge of genomic medicine

00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:32.148
and trying to work out how it applies to you,

00:09:32.148 --> 00:09:34.717
but they're starting from your particular genome.

00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.157
Now think of the power of that.

00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:37.946
Think of where that takes us

00:09:37.946 --> 00:09:40.892
when we can combine genomic data

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:42.381
with clinical data

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.340
with data about drug interactions

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.629
with the kind of ambient data that devices

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:48.388
like our phone and medical sensors

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.246
will increasingly be collecting.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:52.707
Think what happens when we collect all of that data

00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:54.180
and we can put it together

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.668
in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.

00:09:56.668 --> 00:09:59.579
This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:02.020
but this will drive a revolution in medicine.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.340
Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.779
But there's one thing that
doesn't get much attention.

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:10.063
How is that model of colossal sharing

00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:12.709
across all of those kinds of databases

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:15.201
compatible with the business models

00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:17.815
of institutions and organizations and corporations

00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:20.112
that are involved in this business today?

00:10:20.112 --> 00:10:22.888
If your business is based on proprietary data,

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:25.931
if your competitive advantage
is defined by your data,

00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.451
how on Earth is that company or is that society

00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:31.549
in fact going to achieve the value

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:34.554
that's implicit in the technology? They can't.

00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:36.601
So essentially what's happening here,

00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.245
and genomics is merely one example of this,

00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:41.559
is that technology is driving

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:44.128
the natural scaling of the activity

00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:47.055
beyond the institutional boundaries within which

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:49.213
we have been used to thinking about it,

00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:51.376
and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries

00:10:51.376 --> 00:10:53.630
in terms of which business strategy

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.085
as a discipline is formulated.

00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:00.571
The basic story here is that what used to be

00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.233
vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition

00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:07.024
among essentially similar kinds of competitors

00:11:07.024 --> 00:11:09.483
is evolving, by one means or another,

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:12.844
from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.

00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:14.559
Why is that happening?

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:17.064
It's happening because
transaction costs are plummeting

00:11:17.064 --> 00:11:18.992
and because scale is polarizing.

00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:20.734
The plummeting of transaction costs

00:11:20.734 --> 00:11:23.372
weakens the glue that holds value chains together,

00:11:23.372 --> 00:11:25.040
and allows them to separate.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.975
The polarization of scale economies

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:30.101
towards the very small -- small is beautiful --

00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:32.769
allows for scalable communities

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:35.886
to substitute for conventional corporate production.

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:37.890
The scaling in the opposite direction,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.923
towards things like big data,

00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:41.332
drive the structure of business

00:11:41.332 --> 00:11:44.055
towards the creation of new kinds of institutions

00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:46.033
that can achieve that scale.

00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:48.791
But either way, the typically vertical structure

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.795
gets driven to becoming more horizontal.

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.210
The logic isn't just about big data.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.536
If we were to look, for example,
at the telecommunications industry,

00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:59.911
you can tell the same story about fiber optics.

00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:02.047
If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,

00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:03.940
or, for that matter, university research,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.614
you can say exactly the same story

00:12:05.614 --> 00:12:07.353
about so-called "big science."

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:08.888
And in the opposite direction,

00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:11.085
if we look, say, at the energy sector,

00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:13.945
where all the talk is about how households

00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:17.529
will be efficient producers of green energy

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:20.157
and efficient conservers of energy,

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.037
that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.

00:12:22.037 --> 00:12:23.907
That is the fragmentation of scale

00:12:23.907 --> 00:12:26.261
because the very small can substitute

00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:28.855
for the traditional corporate scale.

00:12:28.855 --> 00:12:30.646
Either way, what we are driven to

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:34.017
is this horizontalization of the structure of industries,

00:12:34.017 --> 00:12:36.607
and that implies fundamental changes

00:12:36.607 --> 00:12:38.669
in how we think about strategy.

00:12:38.669 --> 00:12:40.701
It means, for example, that we need to think

00:12:40.701 --> 00:12:43.248
about strategy as the curation

00:12:43.248 --> 00:12:45.893
of these kinds of horizontal structure,

00:12:45.893 --> 00:12:47.533
where things like business definition

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.095
and even industry definition

00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:51.897
are actually the outcomes of strategy,

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:55.078
not something that the strategy presupposes.

00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.234
It means, for example, we need to work out

00:12:58.234 --> 00:13:00.591
how to accommodate collaboration

00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:02.457
and competition simultaneously.

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:03.543
Think about the genome.

00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:05.321
We need to accommodate the very large

00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:07.456
and the very small simultaneously.

00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:09.399
And we need industry structures

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:12.341
that will accommodate very,
very different motivations,

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.974
from the amateur motivations
of people in communities

00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:16.947
to maybe the social motivations

00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:19.283
of infrastructure built by governments,

00:13:19.283 --> 00:13:21.908
or, for that matter, cooperative institutions

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:24.400
built by companies that are otherwise competing,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.394
because that is the only way
that they can get to scale.

00:13:27.394 --> 00:13:29.371
These kinds of transformations

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:33.096
render the traditional premises 
of business strategy obsolete.

00:13:33.096 --> 00:13:35.665
They drive us into a completely new world.

00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:37.086
They require us, whether we are

00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:39.853
in the public sector or the private sector,

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:42.153
to think very fundamentally differently

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:43.973
about the structure of business,

00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:47.427
and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:50.240
Thank you.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.755
