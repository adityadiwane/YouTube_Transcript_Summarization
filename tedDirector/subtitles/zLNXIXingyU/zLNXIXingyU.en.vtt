Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.398
a couple days ago,

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:18.741
and this is response time.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.996
And several of you have written to me

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:25.639
with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.987
So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:30.552
of the National Security Agency,

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:33.838
and he's a senior civilian officer there,

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:35.823
acts as its chief operating officer,

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:39.093
guiding strategies, setting internal policies,

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:43.473
and serving as the principal advisor to the director.

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:45.349
And all being well,

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:48.865
welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:54.191
(Applause)

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.283
Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.

00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:01.237
I look forward to the conversation,

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:04.219
so thanks for arranging for that.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.757
CA: Thank you, Rick.

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:08.324
We appreciate you joining us.

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:10.491
It's certainly quite a strong statement

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.478
that the NSA is willing to reach out

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:16.475
and show a more open face here.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.428
You saw, I think,

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:22.321
the talk and interview that Edward Snowden

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.265
gave here a couple days ago.

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.704
What did you make of it?

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:28.855
RL: So I think it was interesting.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.742
We didn't realize that he 
was going to show up there,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.875
so kudos to you guys for arranging

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:37.578
a nice surprise like that.

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:42.951
I think that, like a lot of the things

00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.470
that have come out since Mr. Snowden

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.035
started disclosing classified information,

00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:53.501
there were some kernels of truth in there,

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.995
but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,

00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:59.518
and I'm interested in helping to address those.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.838
I think this is a really important conversation

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:03.370
that we're having in the United States

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.885
and internationally,

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:09.294
and I think it is important and of import,

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:12.754
and so given that, we need to have that be

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:14.154
a fact-based conversation,

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.606
and we want to help make that happen.

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:21.223
CA: So the question that a lot 
of people have here is,

00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:24.137
what do you make of Snowden's motivations

00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:26.388
for doing what he did,

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:30.878
and did he have an alternative
way that he could have gone?

00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:33.217
RL: He absolutely did

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:37.415
have alternative ways that he could have gone,

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:43.009
and I actually think that characterizing him

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.999
as a whistleblower

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.527
actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.

00:02:48.527 --> 00:02:52.098
So what if somebody who works in the NSA --

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.102
and there are over 35,000 people who do.

00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:57.455
They're all great citizens.

00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.758
They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:03.975
brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.145
all of whom are interested in doing the right thing

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.332
for their country

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:10.366
and for our allies internationally,

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:14.448
and so there are a variety of venues to address

00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:15.622
if folks have a concern.

00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:17.545
First off, there's their supervisor,

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:20.237
and up through the supervisory chain

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:21.979
within their organization.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.626
If folks aren't comfortable with that,

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:25.981
there are a number of inspectors general.

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.522
In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:31.447
of the NSA inspector general,

00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:32.767
the Navy inspector general,

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:34.334
the Pacific Command inspector general,

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.244
the Department of Defense inspector general,

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.350
and the intelligence community inspector general,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.668
any of whom would have both kept
his concerns in classified channels

00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:45.299
and been happy to address them.

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.576
(CA and RL speaking at once)

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:50.179
He had the option to go to
congressional committees,

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.298
and there are mechanisms
to do that that are in place,

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.837
and so he didn't do any of those things.

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.827
CA: Now, you had said that

00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:01.056
Ed Snowden had other avenues

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.751
for raising his concerns.

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:07.077
The comeback on that is a couple of things:

00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:10.887
one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,

00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:14.648
the avenues that would have been available
to him as an employee weren't available,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:18.079
two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.690
like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.837
pretty harshly, by some views,

00:04:23.837 --> 00:04:25.490
and thirdly, what he was taking on

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.827
was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,

00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:30.798
but programs that had been approved

00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:33.739
by all three branches of government.

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:36.538
I mean, in that circumstance,

00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:38.941
couldn't you argue that what he did

00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.207
was reasonable?

00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:43.520
RL: No, I don't agree with that.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.257
I think that the —

00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:49.392
sorry, I'm getting feedback

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:52.949
through the microphone there —

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.776
the actions that he took were inappropriate

00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:02.551
because of the fact that 
he put people's lives at risk,

00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.023
basically, in the long run,

00:05:04.023 --> 00:05:05.587
and I know there's been a lot of talk

00:05:05.587 --> 00:05:10.251
in public by Mr. Snowden
and some of the journalists

00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:13.681
that say that the things that have been disclosed

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.876
have not put national security and people at risk,

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:22.170
and that is categorically not true.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.077
They actually do.

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:26.918
I think there's also an amazing arrogance

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:31.053
to the idea that he knows better than

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:34.348
the framers of the Constitution

00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:36.727
in how the government should 
be designed and work

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.869
for separation of powers

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:45.316
and the fact that the executive 
and the legislative branch

00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:47.927
have to work together and they have
checks and balances on each other,

00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:49.461
and then the judicial branch,

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:50.897
which oversees the entire process.

00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:55.118
I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.

00:05:55.118 --> 00:05:57.424
CA: Can you give a specific example

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:00.880
of how he put people's lives at risk?

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.877
RL: Yeah, sure.

00:06:02.877 --> 00:06:06.271
So the things that he's disclosed,

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:07.786
the capabilities,

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:10.228
and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,

00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:14.102
so when we have foreign intelligence targets,

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:15.733
legitimate things of interest --

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:17.743
like, terrorists is the iconic example,

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.837
but it includes things like human traffickers,

00:06:20.837 --> 00:06:22.699
drug traffickers,

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.663
people who are trying to build
advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,

00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:28.626
and build delivery systems for those,

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:32.257
and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:34.851
which you may have some visibility

00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:37.605
into some of that that's going on right now,

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:41.567
the capabilities are applied

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:46.568
in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:49.356
So the unconstrained disclosure 
of those capabilities

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:51.640
means that as adversaries see them

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.003
and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"

00:06:54.003 --> 00:06:55.570
they move away from that,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.779
and we have seen targets in terrorism,

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.911
in the nation-state area,

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:03.913
in smugglers of various types, and other folks

00:07:03.913 --> 00:07:05.866
who have, because of the disclosures,

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.801
moved away from our ability

00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:10.889
to have insight into what they're doing.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.853
The net effect of that is that our people

00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:15.746
who are overseas in dangerous places,

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:17.610
whether they're diplomats or military,

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.201
and our allies who are in similar situations,

00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:23.060
are at greater risk because we don't see

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.011
the threats that are coming their way.

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:28.070
CA: So that's a general response saying that

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.167
because of his revelations,

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:33.033
access that you had to certain types of information

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:36.604
has been shut down, has been closed down.

00:07:36.604 --> 00:07:40.153
But the concern is that the nature of that access

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:43.857
was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:46.639
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.768
where it's alleged that the NSA

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.153
specifically weakened security

00:07:51.153 --> 00:07:55.722
in order to get the type of 
access that you've spoken of.

00:07:55.722 --> 00:08:00.863
RL: So there are, when our

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:03.575
legitimate foreign intelligence targets
of the type that I described before,

00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:06.611
use the global telecommunications system

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.694
as their communications methodology,

00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:10.108
and they do, because it's a great system,

00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:12.946
it's the most complex system ever devised by man,

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:14.593
and it is a wonder,

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:16.197
and lots of folks in the room there

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.548
are responsible for the creation

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:19.917
and enhancement of that,

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:22.790
and it's just a wonderful thing.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.287
But it's also used by people who are

00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:27.318
working against us and our allies.

00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:29.749
And so if I'm going to pursue them,

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:31.484
I need to have the capability

00:08:31.484 --> 00:08:33.659
to go after them,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.485
and again, the controls are in

00:08:36.485 --> 00:08:39.006
how I apply that capability,

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:41.252
not that I have the capability itself.

00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:43.024
Otherwise, if we could make it so that

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:45.210
all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.166
we could have a domain, badguy.com.

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:48.660
That would be awesome,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.802
and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.

00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:52.134
That's not how it works.

00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:54.345
They're trying to hide

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:56.150
from the government's ability

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.433
to isolate and interdict their actions,

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:02.245
and so we have to swim in that same space.

00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:03.847
But I will tell you this.

00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:05.326
So NSA has two missions.

00:09:05.326 --> 00:09:06.776
One is the Signals Intelligence mission

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:10.403
that we've unfortunately read so
much about in the press.

00:09:10.403 --> 00:09:12.141
The other one is the Information Assurance mission,

00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:15.052
which is to protect the national security
systems of the United States,

00:09:15.052 --> 00:09:17.020
and by that, that's things like

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.036
the communications that the president uses,

00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:21.641
the communications that
control our nuclear weapons,

00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:23.910
the communications that our
military uses around the world,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.401
and the communications that we use with our allies,

00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:28.125
and that some of our allies themselves use.

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:33.962
And so we make recommendations
on standards to use,

00:09:33.962 --> 00:09:35.789
and we use those same standards,

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:37.667
and so we are invested

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:39.912
in making sure that those communications

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:43.525
are secure for their intended purposes.

00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:45.474
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:49.219
when it comes to the Internet at large,

00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:51.846
any strategy is fair game

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:54.762
if it improves America's safety.

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:56.820
And I think this is partly where there is such

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.205
a divide of opinion,

00:09:58.205 --> 00:09:59.455
that there's a lot of people in this room

00:09:59.455 --> 00:10:00.828
and around the world

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:02.478
who think very differently about the Internet.

00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:05.465
They think of it as a momentous

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:07.063
invention of humanity,

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:10.227
kind of on a par with the
Gutenberg press, for example.

00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:12.682
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.

00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:14.386
It's the connector of all.

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:17.771
And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.

00:10:17.771 --> 00:10:19.344
And from that lens,

00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:21.941
what the NSA has done is equivalent to

00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:24.101
the authorities back in Germany

00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:26.970
inserting some device into every printing press

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.511
that would reveal which books people bought

00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:32.531
and what they read.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.762
Can you understand that from that viewpoint,

00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:38.967
it feels outrageous?

00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:42.269
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share
the view of the utility of the Internet,

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:43.971
and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.

00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:46.382
It is a global telecommunications system.

00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:48.833
The Internet is a big chunk of 
that, but there is a lot more.

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:52.176
And I think that people have legitimate concerns

00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:58.482
about the balance between
transparency and secrecy.

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:00.422
That's sort of been couched as a balance

00:11:00.422 --> 00:11:04.058
between privacy and national security.

00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:05.478
I don't think that's the right framing.

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:07.843
I think it really is transparency and secrecy.

00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:11.402
And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,

00:11:11.402 --> 00:11:12.801
and we want to participate in that, and want

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:15.241
people to participate in it in an informed way.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.152
So there are things,

00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:18.602
let me talk there a little bit more,

00:11:18.602 --> 00:11:22.371
there are things that we need
to be transparent about:

00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:24.398
our authorities, our processes,

00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:26.452
our oversight, who we are.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.218
We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,

00:11:28.218 --> 00:11:29.606
and I think that's part of the reason

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.335
that this has been so revelational

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:34.531
and so sensational in the media.

00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:38.657
Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.

00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:41.306
There's takeoffs of our logo

00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:44.325
of an eagle with headphones on around it.

00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:47.948
And so that's the public characterization.

00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:52.284
And so we need to be more
transparent about those things.

00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:53.702
What we don't need to be transparent about,

00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:56.040
because it's bad for the U.S.,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.623
it's bad for all those other
countries that we work with

00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:00.716
and that we help provide information

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:02.438
that helps them secure themselves

00:12:02.438 --> 00:12:03.947
and their people,

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:07.837
it's bad to expose operations and capabilities

00:12:07.837 --> 00:12:13.129
in a way that allows the people
that we're all working against,

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:18.092
the generally recognized bad guys,

00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:20.392
to counter those.

00:12:20.392 --> 00:12:23.417
CA: But isn't it also bad to deal

00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:26.821
a kind of body blow to the American companies

00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:28.717
that have essentially given the world

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:33.897
most of the Internet services that matter?

00:12:33.897 --> 00:12:37.289
RL: It is. It's really the companies are

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.677
in a tough position, as are we,

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.618
because the companies,

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:44.950
we compel them to provide information,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.933
just like every other nation in the world does.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.207
Every industrialized nation in the world

00:12:50.207 --> 00:12:52.307
has a lawful intercept program

00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:54.805
where they are requiring companies

00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:56.216
to provide them with information

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:57.871
that they need for their security,

00:12:57.871 --> 00:13:00.098
and the companies that are involved

00:13:00.098 --> 00:13:01.526
have complied with those programs

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:03.144
in the same way that they have to do

00:13:03.144 --> 00:13:06.594
when they're operating in Russia or the U.K.

00:13:06.594 --> 00:13:10.880
or China or India or France,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.898
any country that you choose to name.

00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:17.807
And so the fact that these revelations

00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:20.101
have been broadly characterized as

00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:21.991
"you can't trust company A because

00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:25.506
your privacy is suspect with them"

00:13:25.506 --> 00:13:29.547
is actually only accurate in the sense that

00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:32.283
it's accurate with every other company in the world

00:13:32.283 --> 00:13:34.442
that deals with any of those countries in the world.

00:13:34.442 --> 00:13:36.570
And so it's being picked up by people

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.164
as a marketing advantage,

00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.937
and it's being marketed that 
way by several countries,

00:13:39.937 --> 00:13:41.448
including some of our allied countries,

00:13:41.448 --> 00:13:42.950
where they are saying,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.479
"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,

00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:47.065
but you can trust our telecom company,

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:48.419
because we're safe."

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:50.078
And they're actually using that to counter

00:13:50.078 --> 00:13:52.396
the very large technological edge

00:13:52.396 --> 00:13:54.205
that U.S. companies have

00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:58.111
in areas like the cloud and
Internet-based technologies.

00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:01.118
CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,

00:14:01.118 --> 00:14:04.688
and the American Constitution guarantees

00:14:04.688 --> 00:14:07.535
freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:09.496
How do you characterize

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:13.976
the American citizen's right to privacy?

00:14:13.976 --> 00:14:16.257
Is there such a right?

00:14:16.257 --> 00:14:18.993
RL: Yeah, of course there is.

00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:22.036
And we devote an inordinate
amount of time and pressure,

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.320
inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.528
amount of time and effort in order to ensure

00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:28.860
that we protect that privacy.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.917
and beyond that, the privacy of citizens

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:35.566
around the world, it's not just Americans.

00:14:35.566 --> 00:14:37.466
Several things come into play here.

00:14:37.466 --> 00:14:39.214
First, we're all in the same network.

00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:40.788
My communications,

00:14:40.788 --> 00:14:44.935
I'm a user of a particular Internet email service

00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:48.906
that is the number one email service of choice

00:14:48.906 --> 00:14:50.499
by terrorists around the world, number one.

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:53.224
So I'm there right beside them in email space

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:55.113
in the Internet.

00:14:55.113 --> 00:14:58.705
And so we need to be able to pick that apart

00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:02.560
and find the information that's relevant.

00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:08.493
In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter

00:15:08.493 --> 00:15:10.561
Americans and innocent foreign citizens

00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:12.107
who are just going about their business,

00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:14.805
and so we have procedures in
place that shreds that out,

00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:17.020
that says, when you find that,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.287
not if you find it, when you find it,
because you're certain to find it,

00:15:19.287 --> 00:15:21.070
here's how you protect that.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.175
These are called minimization procedures.

00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:25.203
They're approved by the attorney general

00:15:25.203 --> 00:15:26.803
and constitutionally based.

00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:29.283
And so we protect those.

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:33.754
And then, for people, citizens of the world

00:15:33.754 --> 00:15:35.633
who are going about their lawful business

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:37.340
on a day-to-day basis,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.636
the president on his January 17 speech,

00:15:39.636 --> 00:15:41.129
laid out some additional protections

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:43.188
that we are providing to them.

00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:45.060
So I think absolutely,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.595
folks do have a right to privacy,

00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:49.214
and that we work very hard to make sure

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.020
that that right to privacy is protected.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.756
CA: What about foreigners using

00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:55.906
American companies' Internet services?

00:15:55.906 --> 00:15:59.751
Do they have any privacy rights?

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:02.424
RL: They do. They do, in the sense of,

00:16:02.424 --> 00:16:08.164
the only way that we are able to compel

00:16:08.164 --> 00:16:10.490
one of those companies to provide us information

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.952
is when it falls into one of three categories:

00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:17.504
We can identify that this particular person,

00:16:17.504 --> 00:16:19.894
identified by a selector of some kind,

00:16:19.894 --> 00:16:23.250
is associated with counterterrorist

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.499
or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:30.281
CA: Much has been made of the fact that

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.747
a lot of the information that you've obtained

00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:35.023
through these programs is essentially metadata.

00:16:35.023 --> 00:16:37.318
It's not necessarily the actual words

00:16:37.318 --> 00:16:38.971
that someone has written in an email

00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:40.320
or given on a phone call.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.369
It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:45.905
But it's been argued,

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:48.016
and someone here in the audience has talked

00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:50.483
to a former NSA analyst who said

00:16:50.483 --> 00:16:52.870
metadata is actually much more invasive

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.273
than the core data,

00:16:54.273 --> 00:16:55.406
because in the core data

00:16:55.406 --> 00:16:58.633
you present yourself as you want to be presented.

00:16:58.633 --> 00:17:01.339
With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:02.755
that are drawn?

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.761
Is there anything to that?

00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:06.550
RL: I don't really understand that argument.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.450
I think that metadata's important
for a couple of reasons.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.928
Metadata is the information that lets you

00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:17.319
find connections that people are trying to hide.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.330
So when a terrorist is corresponding

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.175
with somebody else who's not known to us

00:17:21.175 --> 00:17:23.783
but is engaged in doing or
supporting terrorist activity,

00:17:23.783 --> 00:17:26.209
or someone who's violating international sanctions

00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:29.286
by providing nuclear weapons-related material

00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:31.612
to a country like Iran or North Korea,

00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:35.189
is trying to hide that activity
because it's illicit activity.

00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:37.999
What metadata lets you do is connect that.

00:17:37.999 --> 00:17:39.531
The alternative to that

00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:41.150
is one that's much less efficient

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.531
and much more invasive of privacy,

00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:46.367
which is gigantic amounts of content collection.

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:47.760
So metadata, in that sense,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.156
actually is privacy-enhancing.

00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:52.261
And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff

00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:53.976
that's been printed,

00:17:53.976 --> 00:17:56.745
we don't sit there and grind out

00:17:56.745 --> 00:17:59.582
metadata profiles of average people.

00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:01.538
If you're not connected

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:04.590
to one of those valid intelligence targets,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.003
you are not of interest to us.

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:11.175
CA: So in terms of the threats

00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:13.487
that face America overall,

00:18:13.487 --> 00:18:16.699
where would you place terrorism?

00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:19.797
RL: I think terrorism is still number one.

00:18:19.797 --> 00:18:23.701
I think that we have never been in a time

00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:25.692
where there are more places

00:18:25.692 --> 00:18:28.545
where things are going badly

00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:32.446
and forming the petri dish in which terrorists

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:37.756
take advantage of the lack of governance.

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:41.393
An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,

00:18:41.393 --> 00:18:43.606
used to describe it as arcs of instability.

00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:45.974
And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability

00:18:45.974 --> 00:18:47.667
in the world right now,

00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.504
in places like Syria, where there's a civil war

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:52.214
going on and you have massive numbers,

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.949
thousands and thousands of foreign fighters

00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:55.682
who are coming into Syria

00:18:55.682 --> 00:18:57.185
to learn how to be terrorists

00:18:57.185 --> 00:18:59.286
and practice that activity,

00:18:59.286 --> 00:19:01.985
and lots of those people are Westerners

00:19:01.985 --> 00:19:05.714
who hold passports to European countries

00:19:05.714 --> 00:19:07.466
or in some cases the United States,

00:19:07.466 --> 00:19:09.867
and so they are basically learning how

00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:13.347
to do jihad and have expressed intent

00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:15.760
to go out and do that later on

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.427
in their home countries.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:18.748
You've got places like Iraq,

00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:21.530
which is suffering from a high
level of sectarian violence,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.181
again a breeding ground for terrorism.

00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:26.687
And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa

00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:29.734
and the Sahel area of Africa.

00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:32.262
Again, lots of weak governance

00:19:32.262 --> 00:19:36.153
which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.

00:19:36.153 --> 00:19:38.147
So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.

00:19:38.147 --> 00:19:40.401
I think number two is cyber threat.

00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:46.165
I think cyber is a threat in three ways:

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:49.919
One way, and probably the most common way

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.111
that people have heard about it,

00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:54.111
is due to the theft of intellectual property,

00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:58.415
so basically, foreign countries going in,

00:19:58.415 --> 00:20:00.292
stealing companies' secrets,

00:20:00.292 --> 00:20:02.290
and then providing that information

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.027
to state-owned enterprises

00:20:04.027 --> 00:20:06.976
or companies connected to the government

00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:09.479
to help them leapfrog technology

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:11.554
or to gain business intelligence

00:20:11.554 --> 00:20:14.222
that's then used to win contracts overseas.

00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:17.961
That is a hugely costly set of
activities that's going on right now.

00:20:17.961 --> 00:20:19.428
Several nation-states are doing it.

00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:22.653
Second is the denial-of-service attacks.

00:20:22.653 --> 00:20:24.032
You're probably aware that there have been

00:20:24.032 --> 00:20:26.003
a spate of those directed against

00:20:26.003 --> 00:20:29.591
the U.S. financial sector since 2012.

00:20:29.591 --> 00:20:32.208
Again, that's a nation-state who
is executing those attacks,

00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:33.281
and they're doing that

00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:38.034
as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.

00:20:38.034 --> 00:20:39.424
And the last one is destructive attacks,

00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:40.950
and those are the ones that concern me the most.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.350
Those are on the rise.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.980
You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.670
August of 2012.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.955
It took down about 35,000 of their computers

00:20:49.955 --> 00:20:51.747
with a Wiper-style virus.

00:20:51.747 --> 00:20:53.660
You had a follow-on a week later

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.194
to a Qatari company.

00:20:55.194 --> 00:20:57.335
You had March of 2013,

00:20:57.335 --> 00:21:00.006
you had a South Korean attack

00:21:00.006 --> 00:21:02.439
that was attributed in the press to North Korea

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:04.494
that took out thousands of computers.

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:05.939
Those are on the rise,

00:21:05.939 --> 00:21:08.673
and we see people expressing interest

00:21:08.673 --> 00:21:09.849
in those capabilities

00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:11.866
and a desire to employ them.

00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:13.432
CA: Okay, so a couple of things here,

00:21:13.432 --> 00:21:15.374
because this is really the core of this, almost.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.638
I mean, first of all,

00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:18.196
a lot of people who look at risk

00:21:18.196 --> 00:21:19.413
and look at the numbers

00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:21.673
don't understand this belief that terrorism

00:21:21.673 --> 00:21:23.557
is still the number one threat.

00:21:23.557 --> 00:21:25.185
Apart from September 11,

00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:27.540
I think the numbers are that
in the last 30 or 40 years

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.641
about 500 Americans have died from terrorism,

00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.624
mostly from homegrown terrorists.

00:21:34.624 --> 00:21:36.211
The chance in the last few years

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.934
of being killed by terrorism

00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:41.918
is far less than the chance
of being killed by lightning.

00:21:41.918 --> 00:21:45.324
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident

00:21:45.324 --> 00:21:48.650
or bioterrorism act or something like that

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.551
would change those numbers.

00:21:50.551 --> 00:21:52.713
Would that be the point of view?

00:21:52.713 --> 00:21:53.889
RL: Well, I'd say two things.

00:21:53.889 --> 00:21:55.815
One is, the reason that there hasn't been

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.625
a major attack in the United States since 9/11,

00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:59.181
that is not an accident.

00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:01.367
That's a lot of hard work that we have done,

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:02.748
that other folks

00:22:02.748 --> 00:22:04.131
in the intelligence community have done,

00:22:04.131 --> 00:22:05.312
that the military has done,

00:22:05.312 --> 00:22:07.360
and that our allies around the globe have done.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.811
You've heard the numbers about

00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:12.343
the tip of the iceberg in terms

00:22:12.343 --> 00:22:14.913
of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs

00:22:14.913 --> 00:22:17.672
contributed to stopping was 54,

00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:19.494
25 of those in Europe,

00:22:19.494 --> 00:22:21.624
and of those 25,

00:22:21.624 --> 00:22:24.229
18 of them occurred in three countries,

00:22:24.229 --> 00:22:26.092
some of which are our allies,

00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:28.291
and some of which are beating the heck out of us

00:22:28.291 --> 00:22:32.768
over the NSA programs, by the way.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:35.460
So that's not an accident that those things happen.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.785
That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:39.615
on terrorist activities

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:41.189
and interdicting them through one way or another,

00:22:41.189 --> 00:22:42.520
through law enforcement,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.350
through cooperative activities with other countries

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.466
and sometimes through military action.

00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:51.359
The other thing I would say is that

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:56.625
your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:58.141
is not at all far-fetched

00:22:58.141 --> 00:22:59.879
and in fact there are a number of groups

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.766
who have for several years expressed interest

00:23:01.766 --> 00:23:04.306
and desire in obtaining those capabilities

00:23:04.306 --> 00:23:06.066
and work towards that.

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:07.642
CA: It's also been said that,

00:23:07.642 --> 00:23:10.342
of those 54 alleged incidents,

00:23:10.342 --> 00:23:12.190
that as few as zero of them

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.252
were actually anything to do

00:23:13.252 --> 00:23:15.099
with these controversial programs

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:18.831
that Mr. Snowden revealed,

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:22.748
that it was basically through
other forms of intelligence,

00:23:22.748 --> 00:23:25.638
that you're looking for a needle in a haystack,

00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:27.200
and the effects of these programs,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.231
these controversial programs,

00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:30.303
is just to add hay to the stack,

00:23:30.303 --> 00:23:31.883
not to really find the needle.

00:23:31.883 --> 00:23:33.965
The needle was found by other methods.

00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:38.089
Isn't there something to that?

00:23:38.089 --> 00:23:40.497
RL: No, there's actually two programs

00:23:40.497 --> 00:23:42.914
that are typically implicated in that discussion.

00:23:42.914 --> 00:23:45.392
One is the section 215 program,

00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:48.370
the U.S. telephony metadata program,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.410
and the other one is

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.004
popularly called the PRISM program,

00:23:52.004 --> 00:23:55.252
and it's actually section 702 
of the FISA Amendment Act.

00:23:55.252 --> 00:23:59.442
But the 215 program

00:23:59.442 --> 00:24:01.169
is only relevant to threats

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:03.428
that are directed against the United States,

00:24:03.428 --> 00:24:06.328
and there have been a dozen threats

00:24:06.328 --> 00:24:07.643
where that was implicated.

00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:10.832
Now what you'll see people say publicly

00:24:10.832 --> 00:24:12.868
is there is no "but for" case,

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:16.681
and so there is no case where, but for that,

00:24:16.681 --> 00:24:18.382
the threat would have happened.

00:24:18.382 --> 00:24:22.589
But that actually indicates a lack of understanding

00:24:22.589 --> 00:24:27.706
of how terrorist investigations actually work.

00:24:27.706 --> 00:24:29.184
You think about on television,

00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:30.516
you watch a murder mystery.

00:24:30.516 --> 00:24:32.046
What do you start with? You start with a body,

00:24:32.046 --> 00:24:34.282
and then they work their way
from there to solve the crime.

00:24:34.282 --> 00:24:35.813
We're actually starting well before that,

00:24:35.813 --> 00:24:37.314
hopefully before there are any bodies,

00:24:37.314 --> 00:24:39.747
and we're trying to build the case for

00:24:39.747 --> 00:24:42.177
who the people are, what they're trying to do,

00:24:42.177 --> 00:24:45.027
and that involves massive amounts of information.

00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:46.508
Think of it is as mosaic,

00:24:46.508 --> 00:24:48.670
and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.302
was necessary to building the mosaic,

00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:53.031
but to build the complete picture,

00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:54.996
you need to have all the pieces of information.

00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:58.101
On the other, the non-U.S.-related
threats out of those 54,

00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:01.290
the other 42 of them,

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.920
the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.906
and in fact was material in contributing

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:10.788
to stopping those attacks.

00:25:10.788 --> 00:25:12.125
CA: Snowden said two days ago

00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:15.495
that terrorism has always been

00:25:15.495 --> 00:25:17.623
what is called in the intelligence world

00:25:17.623 --> 00:25:19.169
"a cover for action,"

00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.106
that it's something that,

00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:22.822
because it invokes such a powerful

00:25:22.822 --> 00:25:24.661
emotional response in people,

00:25:24.661 --> 00:25:27.295
it allows the initiation of these programs

00:25:27.295 --> 00:25:30.856
to achieve powers that an organization like yours

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:32.423
couldn't otherwise have.

00:25:32.423 --> 00:25:35.875
Is there any internal debate about that?

00:25:35.875 --> 00:25:37.287
RL: Yeah.

00:25:37.287 --> 00:25:39.287
I mean, we debate these things all the time,

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:42.046
and there is discussion that goes on

00:25:42.046 --> 00:25:43.967
in the executive branch

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:46.030
and within NSA itself

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.685
and the intelligence community about

00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:49.045
what's right, what's proportionate,

00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:50.306
what's the correct thing to do.

00:25:50.306 --> 00:25:51.884
And it's important to note that the programs

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:53.231
that we're talking about

00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:56.633
were all authorized by two different presidents,

00:25:56.633 --> 00:25:58.378
two different political parties,

00:25:58.378 --> 00:26:00.513
by Congress twice,

00:26:00.513 --> 00:26:04.349
and by federal judges 16 different times,

00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:09.061
and so this is not NSA running off

00:26:09.061 --> 00:26:10.524
and doing its own thing.

00:26:10.524 --> 00:26:12.972
This is a legitimate activity

00:26:12.972 --> 00:26:15.490
of the United States foreign government

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.665
that was agreed to by all the branches

00:26:17.665 --> 00:26:19.649
of the United States government,

00:26:19.649 --> 00:26:22.698
and President Madison would have been proud.

00:26:22.698 --> 00:26:26.787
CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered

00:26:26.787 --> 00:26:29.017
what was actually being done 
with that authorization,

00:26:29.017 --> 00:26:31.886
many of them were completely shocked.

00:26:31.886 --> 00:26:35.232
Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,

00:26:35.232 --> 00:26:37.337
that it's only because it's now come out publicly,

00:26:37.337 --> 00:26:40.439
that they really knew exactly what you were doing

00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:42.775
with the powers they had granted you?

00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:44.449
RL: Congress is a big body.

00:26:44.449 --> 00:26:46.426
There's 535 of them,

00:26:46.426 --> 00:26:48.567
and they change out frequently,

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:50.425
in the case of the House, every two years,

00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:54.201
and I think that the NSA provided

00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:57.338
all the relevant information
to our oversight committees,

00:26:57.338 --> 00:26:59.616
and then the dissemination of that information

00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:01.515
by the oversight committees throughout Congress

00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:04.149
is something that they manage.

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:09.005
I think I would say that Congress members

00:27:09.005 --> 00:27:12.836
had the opportunity to make themselves aware,

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:14.705
and in fact a significant number of them,

00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:18.163
the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,

00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:19.337
did have the ability to do that.

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:23.275
And you've actually had the chairs of
those committees say that in public.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.832
CA: Now, you mentioned the 
threat of cyberattacks,

00:27:24.832 --> 00:27:26.999
and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:28.889
that that is a huge concern,

00:27:28.889 --> 00:27:30.723
but do you accept that there's a tradeoff

00:27:30.723 --> 00:27:33.134
between offensive and defensive strategies,

00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:35.959
and that it's possible that the very measures taken

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:38.628
to, "weaken encryption,"

00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:40.781
and allow yourself to find the bad guys,

00:27:40.781 --> 00:27:45.054
might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?

00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:47.897
RL: So I think two things.

00:27:47.897 --> 00:27:51.744
One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.

00:27:51.744 --> 00:27:56.870
And the other one is that

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.646
the NSA has both of those missions,

00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.927
and we are heavily biased towards defense,

00:28:01.927 --> 00:28:05.444
and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find

00:28:05.444 --> 00:28:07.545
in the overwhelming majority of cases,

00:28:07.545 --> 00:28:10.318
we disclose to the people who are responsible

00:28:10.318 --> 00:28:13.681
for manufacturing or developing those products.

00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:15.064
We have a great track record of that,

00:28:15.064 --> 00:28:17.050
and we're actually working on a proposal right now

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.220
to be transparent and to
publish transparency reports

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.106
in the same way that the Internet companies

00:28:23.106 --> 00:28:26.973
are being allowed to publish
transparency reports for them.

00:28:26.973 --> 00:28:28.971
We want to be more transparent about that.

00:28:28.971 --> 00:28:32.100
So again, we eat our own dog food.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.353
We use the standards, we use the products

00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:37.008
that we recommend,

00:28:37.008 --> 00:28:39.303
and so it's in our interest

00:28:39.303 --> 00:28:41.941
to keep our communications protected

00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:45.745
in the same way that other people's need to be.

00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:48.935
CA: Edward Snowden,

00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:53.363
when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here

00:28:53.363 --> 00:28:54.608
in the bot,

00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:56.796
and I heard him say to a couple of people,

00:28:56.796 --> 00:28:58.413
they asked him about what he thought

00:28:58.413 --> 00:29:00.006
of the NSA overall,

00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:02.779
and he was very complimentary about the people

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:04.800
who work with you,

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.723
said that it's a really

00:29:08.723 --> 00:29:10.683
impassioned group of employees

00:29:10.683 --> 00:29:13.132
who are seeking to do the right thing,

00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:16.086
and that the problems have come from

00:29:16.086 --> 00:29:19.205
just some badly conceived policies.

00:29:19.205 --> 00:29:23.650
He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.825
He didn't come over like a crazy man.

00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:27.795
Would you accept that at least,

00:29:27.795 --> 00:29:30.811
even if you disagree with how he did it,

00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:34.835
that he has opened a debate that matters?

00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:37.233
RL: So I think that the discussion

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:39.097
is an important one to have.

00:29:39.097 --> 00:29:42.473
I do not like the way that he did it.

00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:44.478
I think there were a number of other ways

00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:45.940
that he could have done that

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.236
that would have not endangered our people

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:51.884
and the people of other nations

00:29:51.884 --> 00:29:53.995
through losing visibility

00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:56.726
into what our adversaries are doing.

00:29:56.726 --> 00:29:59.412
But I do think it's an important conversation.

00:29:59.412 --> 00:30:00.951
CA: It's been reported that there's

00:30:00.951 --> 00:30:03.060
almost a difference of opinion

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.531
with you and your colleagues

00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:06.584
over any scenario in which

00:30:06.584 --> 00:30:09.187
he might be offered an amnesty deal.

00:30:09.187 --> 00:30:11.898
I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,

00:30:11.898 --> 00:30:13.884
has said that that would be a terrible example

00:30:13.884 --> 00:30:15.349
for others;

00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:17.006
you can't negotiate with someone

00:30:17.006 --> 00:30:19.014
who's broken the law in that way.

00:30:19.014 --> 00:30:21.023
But you've been quoted as saying that,

00:30:21.023 --> 00:30:24.231
if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering

00:30:24.231 --> 00:30:26.027
all undisclosed documents,

00:30:26.027 --> 00:30:28.266
that a deal maybe should be considered.

00:30:28.266 --> 00:30:31.236
Do you still think that?

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:32.754
RL: Yeah, so actually,

00:30:32.754 --> 00:30:35.337
this is my favorite thing about
that "60 Minutes" interview

00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:37.049
was all the misquotes that came from that.

00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:39.964
What I actually said, in 
response to a question about,

00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:41.776
would you entertain any discussions

00:30:41.776 --> 00:30:48.161
of mitigating action against Snowden,

00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:49.993
I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.

00:30:49.993 --> 00:30:51.628
This is something that the attorney general

00:30:51.628 --> 00:30:53.558
of the United States and the president also

00:30:53.558 --> 00:30:55.096
actually have both talked about this,

00:30:55.096 --> 00:30:56.465
and I defer to the attorney general,

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:58.012
because this is his lane.

00:30:58.012 --> 00:31:00.521
But there is a strong tradition

00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:03.713
in American jurisprudence

00:31:03.713 --> 00:31:08.288
of having discussions with people

00:31:08.288 --> 00:31:10.132
who have been charged with crimes in order to,

00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:11.648
if it benefits the government,

00:31:11.648 --> 00:31:14.026
to get something out of that,

00:31:14.026 --> 00:31:16.660
that there's always room for that kind of discussion.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.349
So I'm not presupposing any outcome,

00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:22.085
but there is always room for discussion.

00:31:22.085 --> 00:31:23.685
CA: To a lay person it seems like

00:31:23.685 --> 00:31:27.053
he has certain things to offer the U.S.,

00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:28.792
the government, you, others,

00:31:28.792 --> 00:31:30.473
in terms of putting things right

00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.531
and helping figure out a smarter policy,

00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:37.737
a smarter way forward for the future.

00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:41.061
Do you see, has that kind of possibility

00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:43.459
been entertained at all?

00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:45.097
RL: So that's out of my lane.

00:31:45.097 --> 00:31:46.626
That's not an NSA thing.

00:31:46.626 --> 00:31:48.833
That would be a Department of Justice

00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:51.330
sort of discussion.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.626
I'll defer to them.

00:31:54.626 --> 00:31:57.591
CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,

00:31:57.591 --> 00:32:01.336
I offered him the chance to
share an idea worth spreading.

00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:02.989
What would be your idea worth spreading

00:32:02.989 --> 00:32:05.271
for this group?

00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:07.263
RL: So I think, learn the facts.

00:32:07.263 --> 00:32:09.879
This is a really important conversation,

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:11.955
and it impacts, it's not just NSA,

00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:13.153
it's not just the government,

00:32:13.153 --> 00:32:16.061
it's you, it's the Internet companies.

00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.179
The issue of privacy and personal data

00:32:19.179 --> 00:32:20.756
is much bigger than just the government,

00:32:20.756 --> 00:32:22.667
and so learn the facts.

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.263
Don't rely on headlines,

00:32:24.263 --> 00:32:25.939
don't rely on sound bites,

00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:28.419
don't rely on one-sided conversations.

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:31.568
So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.

00:32:31.568 --> 00:32:34.961
We have a sign, a badge tab,

00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:36.850
we wear badges at work with lanyards,

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.263
and if I could make a plug,

00:32:38.263 --> 00:32:41.010
my badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys."

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.507
Go Dallas.

00:32:44.507 --> 00:32:47.173
I've just alienated half the audience, I know.

00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:51.069
So the lanyard that our people

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.854
who work in the organization

00:32:52.854 --> 00:32:55.274
that does our crypto-analytic work

00:32:55.274 --> 00:32:57.215
have a tab that says, "Look at the data."

00:32:57.215 --> 00:32:58.751
So that's the idea worth spreading.

00:32:58.751 --> 00:33:01.000
Look at the data.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.992
CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,

00:33:03.992 --> 00:33:06.607
I think, actually, to come and speak openly

00:33:06.607 --> 00:33:07.861
to this group.

00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:10.528
It's not something the NSA
has done a lot of in the past,

00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:13.623
and plus the technology has been challenging.

00:33:13.623 --> 00:33:15.404
We truly appreciate you doing that

00:33:15.404 --> 00:33:17.817
and sharing in this very important conversation.

00:33:17.817 --> 00:33:19.958
Thank you so much.

00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:21.897
RL: Thanks, Chris.

00:33:21.897 --> 00:33:28.968
(Applause)
