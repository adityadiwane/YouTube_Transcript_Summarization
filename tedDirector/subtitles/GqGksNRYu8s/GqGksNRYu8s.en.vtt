00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.320
Let's talk about trust.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.736
We all know trust is fundamental,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.376
but when it comes to trusting people,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.160
something profound is happening.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.056
Please raise your hand

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.400
if you have ever been
a host or a guest on Airbnb.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.616
Wow. That's a lot of you.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.080
Who owns Bitcoin?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.896
Still a lot of you. OK.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.616
And please raise your hand
if you've ever used Tinder

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.256
to help you find a mate.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.096
(Laughter)

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.496
This one's really hard to count
because you're kind of going like this.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.336
(Laughter)

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.136
These are all examples of how technology

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.256
is creating new mechanisms

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.296
that are enabling us to trust
unknown people, companies and ideas.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.336
And yet at the same time,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.896
trust in institutions --

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.856
banks, governments and even churches --

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.256
is collapsing.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.496
So what's happening here,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.280
and who do you trust?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.696
Let's start in France with a platform --
with a company, I should say --

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.856
with a rather funny-sounding name,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.136
BlaBlaCar.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.776
It's a platform that matches
drivers and passengers

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.816
who want to share
long-distance journeys together.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.056
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.680
So it's a good idea
to choose your fellow travelers wisely.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.296
Social profiles and reviews
help people make a choice.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.336
You can see if someone's a smoker,
you can see what kind of music they like,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960
you can see if they're going to bring
their dog along for the ride.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.016
But it turns out
that the key social identifier

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.656
is how much you're going
to talk in the car.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.496
(Laughter)

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.136
Bla, not a lot,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.456
bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.216
and bla bla bla, you're not going
to stop talking the entire way

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.696
from London to Paris.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.016
(Laughter)

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.056
It's remarkable, right,
that this idea works at all,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.936
because it's counter to the lesson
most of us were taught as a child:

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.280
never get in a car with a stranger.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.816
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports
more than four million people

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.080
every single month.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.216
To put that in context,
that's more passengers

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.720
than the Eurostar
or JetBlue airlines carry.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.496
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration
of how technology is enabling

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.120
millions of people across the world
to take a trust leap.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.816
A trust leap happens when we take the risk
to do something new or different

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.880
to the way that we've always done it.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.000
Let's try to visualize this together.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.520
OK. I want you to close your eyes.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.376
There is a man staring at me
with his eyes wide open.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.856
I'm on this big red circle. I can see.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.296
So close your eyes.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.176
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.456
I'll do it with you.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.496
And I want you to imagine
there exists a gap

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.080
between you and something unknown.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.616
That unknown can be
someone you've just met.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.736
It can be a place you've never been to.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.136
It can be something
you've never tried before.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.376
You got it?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.496
OK. You can open your eyes now.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.856
For you to leap from a place of certainty,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.456
to take a chance on that someone
or something unknown,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.816
you need a force to pull you over the gap,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.680
and that remarkable force is trust.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.176
Trust is an elusive concept,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.576
and yet we depend on it
for our lives to function.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.856
I trust my children

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.736
when they say they're going
to turn the lights out at night.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.976
I trusted the pilot
who flew me here to keep me safe.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.816
It's a word we use a lot,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.256
without always thinking
about what it really means

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.656
and how it works in different
contexts of our lives.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.296
There are, in fact,
hundreds of definitions of trust,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.896
and most can be reduced
to some kind of risk assessment

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.680
of how likely it is
that things will go right.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.696
But I don't like this definition of trust,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.016
because it makes trust
sound rational and predictable,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.616
and it doesn't really get
to the human essence

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.576
of what it enables us to do

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.576
and how it empowers us

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.696
to connect with other people.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.776
So I define trust a little differently.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.240
I define trust as a confident
relationship to the unknown.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.016
Now, when you view trust
through this lens,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.696
it starts to explain
why it has the unique capacity

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.816
to enable us to cope with uncertainty,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.856
to place our faith in strangers,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.760
to keep moving forward.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.176
Human beings are remarkable

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880
at taking trust leaps.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.376
Do you remember the first time
you put your credit card details

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.616
into a website?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.976
That's a trust leap.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.936
I distinctly remember telling my dad

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.216
that I wanted to buy a navy blue
secondhand Peugeot on eBay,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.896
and he rightfully pointed out

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.296
that the seller's name
was "Invisible Wizard"

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.416
and that this probably
was not such a good idea.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.136
(Laughter)

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.576
So my work, my research
focuses on how technology

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.256
is transforming
the social glue of society,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.936
trust between people,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.216
and it's a fascinating area to study,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.616
because there's still
so much we do not know.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.736
For instance, do men and women
trust differently in digital environments?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.656
Does the way we build trust
face-to-face translate online?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.616
Does trust transfer?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.336
So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.720
are you more likely
to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.696
But from studying hundreds
of networks and marketplaces,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.536
there is a common pattern
that people follow,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.216
and I call it "climbing the trust stack."

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.440
Let me use BlaBlaCar
as an example to bring it to life.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.376
On the first level,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.576
you have to trust the idea.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.816
So you have to trust

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.240
the idea of ride-sharing
is safe and worth trying.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.336
The second level is about having
confidence in the platform,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.496
that BlaBlaCar will help you
if something goes wrong.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.176
And the third level is about
using little bits of information

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.680
to decide whether
the other person is trustworthy.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.816
Now, the first time
we climb the trust stack,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.096
it feels weird, even risky,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.096
but we get to a point
where these ideas seem totally normal.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.416
Our behaviors transform,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.416
often relatively quickly.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.240
In other words, trust enables
change and innovation.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.696
So an idea that intrigued me,
and I'd like you to consider,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.256
is whether we can better understand

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.456
major waves of disruption and change
in individuals in society

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.536
through the lens of trust.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.856
Well, it turns out
that trust has only evolved

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.536
in three significant chapters
throughout the course of human history:

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.776
local, institutional

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.200
and what we're now entering, distributed.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.016
So for a long time,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.296
until the mid-1800s,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.256
trust was built
around tight-knit relationships.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.296
So say I lived in a village

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.896
with the first five rows of this audience,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.856
and we all knew one another,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.776
and say I wanted to borrow money.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.776
The man who had his eyes wide open,
he might lend it to me,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.896
and if I didn't pay him back,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.576
you'd all know I was dodgy.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.256
I would get a bad reputation,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.336
and you would refuse
to do business with me in the future.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.576
Trust was mostly local
and accountability-based.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.936
In the mid-19th century,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.376
society went through
a tremendous amount of change.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.176
People moved to fast-growing cities
such as London and San Francisco,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.056
and a local banker here
was replaced by large corporations

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.976
that didn't know us as individuals.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.976
We started to place our trust

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.576
into black box systems of authority,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.896
things like legal contracts
and regulation and insurance,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.936
and less trust directly in other people.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.816
Trust became institutional
and commission-based.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.656
It's widely talked about how trust
in institutions and many corporate brands

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.416
has been steadily declining
and continues to do so.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.056
I am constantly stunned
by major breaches of trust:

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.576
the News Corp phone hacking,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.416
the Volkswagen emissions scandal,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.775
the widespread abuse
in the Catholic Church,

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:54.015
the fact that only one measly banker

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:57.336
went to jail after the great
financial crisis,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.416
or more recently the Panama Papers

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.576
that revealed how the rich
can exploit offshore tax regimes.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.056
And the thing that really surprises me

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.096
is why do leaders find it so hard

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.296
to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.480
when our trust is broken?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.496
It would be easy to conclude
that institutional trust isn't working

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.016
because we are fed up

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.936
with the sheer audacity
of dishonest elites,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.936
but what's happening now

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.576
runs deeper than the rampant questioning
of the size and structure of institutions.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.616
We're starting to realize

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.416
that institutional trust

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.416
wasn't designed for the digital age.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.096
Conventions of how trust is built,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.456
managed, lost and repaired --

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.976
in brands, leaders and entire systems --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
is being turned upside down.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.856
Now, this is exciting,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.416
but it's frightening,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.136
because it forces many of us
to have to rethink

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.856
how trust is built and destroyed
with our customers, with our employees,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.360
even our loved ones.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.976
The other day, I was talking to the CEO
of a leading international hotel brand,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.240
and as is often the case,
we got onto the topic of Airbnb.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.936
And he admitted to me
that he was perplexed by their success.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.096
He was perplexed at how a company

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.296
that depends on the willingness
of strangers to trust one another

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.280
could work so well across 191 countries.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.056
So I said to him
that I had a confession to make,

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.056
and he looked at me a bit strangely,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.456
and I said --

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.496
and I'm sure many of you
do this as well --

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.016
I don't always bother to hang my towels up

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.976
when I'm finished in the hotel,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.640
but I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.896
And the reason why I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.576
is because guests know
that they'll be rated by hosts,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.336
and that those ratings
are likely to impact their ability

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.040
to transact in the future.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.896
It's a simple illustration of how
online trust will change our behaviors

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.216
in the real world,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.736
make us more accountable

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.200
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.936
I am not saying we do not need hotels

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.296
or traditional forms of authority.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.416
But what we cannot deny

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.696
is that the way trust
flows through society is changing,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.016
and it's creating this big shift

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.896
away from the 20th century

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.736
that was defined by institutional trust

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.256
towards the 21st century

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.920
that will be fueled by distributed trust.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.656
Trust is no longer top-down.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.776
It's being unbundled and inverted.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.640
It's no longer opaque and linear.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.136
A new recipe for trust is emerging

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.056
that once again
is distributed amongst people

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.216
and is accountability-based.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.656
And this shift is only going to accelerate

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.416
with the emergence of the blockchain,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.080
the innovative ledger technology
underpinning Bitcoin.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.736
Now let's be honest,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.216
getting our heads around
the way blockchain works

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.680
is mind-blowing.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.976
And one of the reasons why
is it involves processing

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.656
some pretty complicated concepts

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.176
with terrible names.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.696
I mean, cryptographic algorithms
and hash functions,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.776
and people called miners,
who verify transactions --

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.376
all that was created
by this mysterious person

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.136
or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.816
Now, that is a massive trust leap
that hasn't happened yet.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.896
(Applause)

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.376
But let's try to imagine this.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.096
So "The Economist"
eloquently described the blockchain

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.776
as the great chain
of being sure about things.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.856
The easiest way I can describe it
is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.856
and they are filled with assets.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.296
So that could be a property title.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.336
It could be a stock trade.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.320
It could be a creative asset,
such as the rights to a song.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.976
Every time something moves

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.816
from one place on the register
to somewhere else,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.936
that asset transfer is time-stamped

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.376
and publicly recorded on the blockchain.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.280
It's that simple. Right.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.816
So the real implication of the blockchain

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.976
is that it removes the need
for any kind of third party,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.336
such as a lawyer,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.816
or a trusted intermediary,
or maybe not a government intermediary

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.656
to facilitate the exchange.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.936
So if we go back to the trust stack,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.696
you still have to trust the idea,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.016
you have to trust the platform,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.976
but you don't have to trust
the other person

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.936
in the traditional sense.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.456
The implications are huge.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.176
In the same way the internet blew open
the doors to an age of information

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.616
available to everyone,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.960
the blockchain will revolutionize
trust on a global scale.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.176
Now, I've waited to the end
intentionally to mention Uber,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.656
because I recognize
that it is a contentious

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.296
and widely overused example,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.560
but in the context of a new era of trust,
it's a great case study.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.656
Now, we will see cases of abuse
of distributed trust.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.336
We've already seen this,
and it can go horribly wrong.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.536
I am not surprised that we are seeing
protests from taxi associations

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.896
all around the world

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.800
trying to get governments to ban Uber
based on claims that it is unsafe.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.696
I happened to be in London
the day that these protests took place,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.696
and I happened to notice a tweet

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.336
from Matt Hancock, who is
a British minister for business.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.576
And he wrote,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.576
"Does anyone have details of this
#Uber app everyone's talking about?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.800
(Laughter)

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.520
I'd never heard of it until today."

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.840
Now, the taxi associations,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.536
they legitimized the first layer
of the trust stack.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.896
They legitimized the idea
that they were trying to eliminate,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.056
and sign-ups increased
by 850 percent in 24 hours.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.336
Now, this is a really strong illustration

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.176
of how once a trust shift has happened
around a behavior or an entire sector,

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.440
you cannot reverse the story.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.976
Every day, five million people
will take a trust leap

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.536
and ride with Uber.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.776
In China, on Didi,
the ride-sharing platform,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.696
11 million rides taken every day.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.336
That's 127 rides per second,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.176
showing that this is
a cross-cultural phenomenon.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.376
And the fascinating thing is
that both drivers and passengers report

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.896
that seeing a name

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.896
and seeing someone's photo
and their rating

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.176
makes them feel safer,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.776
and as you may have experienced,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.760
even behave a little more nicely
in the taxi cab.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.056
Uber and Didi are early
but powerful examples

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.056
of how technology
is creating trust between people

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.360
in ways and on a scale
never possible before.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.176
Today, many of us are comfortable
getting into cars driven by strangers.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.496
We meet up with someone
we swiped right to be matched with.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.456
We share our homes
with people we do not know.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.840
This is just the beginning,

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.016
because the real disruption happening

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.976
isn't technological.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.320
It's the trust shift it creates,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.976
and for my part, I want to help people
understand this new era of trust

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.656
so that we can get it right

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.576
and we can embrace
the opportunities to redesign systems

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.696
that are more transparent,
inclusive and accountable.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.976
Thank you very much.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.576
(Applause)

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.816
Thank you.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.548
(Applause)
