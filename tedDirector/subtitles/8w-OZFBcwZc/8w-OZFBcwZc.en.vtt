00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:14.402
"Iran is Israel's best friend,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.111
and we do not intend to change our position

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:20.591
in relation to Tehran."

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:22.314
Believe it or not, this is a quote

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:24.513
from an Israeli prime minister,

00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:26.957
but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:29.150
from the era of the Shah.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.568
It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:34.054
The year is 1987.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:35.975
Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.913
and much like Ahmadinejad today,

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.813
he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.

00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:43.692
Yet, Rabin referred to Iran

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:46.942
as a geostrategic friend.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.638
Today, when we hear the threats of war

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.044
and the high rhetoric,

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:52.675
we're oftentimes led to believe

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.958
that this is yet another one of those unsolvable

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.833
Middle Eastern conflicts

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.561
with roots as old as the region itself.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.450
Nothing could be further from the truth,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.482
and I hope today to show you why that is.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:11.820
The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.300
throughout history has actually been quite positive,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.700
starting in 539 B.C.,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.589
when King Cyrus the Great of Persia

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:22.283
liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.754
A third of the Jewish population

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:26.320
stayed in Babylonia.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.570
They're today's Iraqi Jews.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.676
A third migrated to Persia.

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:33.752
They're today's Iranian Jews,

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:36.783
still 25,000 of them living in Iran,

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:38.695
making them the largest Jewish community

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:41.943
in the Middle East outside of Israel itself.

00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:44.574
And a third returned to historic Palestine,

00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:47.625
did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:52.774
financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money.

00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:54.860
But even in modern times,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.305
relations have been close at times.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.106
Rabin's statement was a reflection

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:04.064
of decades of security and intelligence collaboration

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:06.600
between the two, which in turn

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.597
was born out of perception of common threats.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.412
Both states feared the Soviet Union

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:18.559
and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.800
And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.092
the idea that Israel's security was best achieved

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:30.170
by creating alliances with the non-Arab states

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.076
in the periphery of the region

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:36.965
in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.433
Now, from the Shah's perspective, though,

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:43.087
he wanted to keep this as secret as possible,

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:45.335
so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.227
traveled to Iran in the '70s,

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.675
he usually wore a wig

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:51.086
so that no one would recognize him.

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.521
The Iranians built a special tarmac

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:56.773
at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,

00:02:56.773 --> 00:02:59.078
so that no one would notice the large number

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:04.499
of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.686
Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:10.639
in 1979?

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.706
In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:17.099
of the new regime, the geopolitical logic

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.703
for their collaboration lived on,

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:22.515
because they still had common threats.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:25.544
And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:28.034
Israel feared an Iraqi victory

00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:30.785
and actively helped Iran by selling it arms

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.037
and providing it with spare parts

00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:35.197
for Iran's American weaponry

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.913
at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable

00:03:38.913 --> 00:03:41.415
because of an American arms embargo

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:44.403
that Israel was more than happy to violate.

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:47.161
In fact, back in the 1980s,

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.970
it was Israel that lobbied Washington

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.079
to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.703
and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:01.642
And this, of course, climaxed

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:06.293
in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:08.293
But with the end of the Cold War

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:12.731
came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.091
Suddenly, the two common threats

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.144
that had pushed them closer together throughout decades,

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:20.590
more or less evaporated.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.552
The Soviet Union collapsed,

00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:24.244
Iraq was defeated,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.325
and a new environment was created in the region

00:04:26.325 --> 00:04:28.665
in which both of them felt more secure,

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.585
but they were also now left unchecked.

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:34.700
Without Iraq balancing Iran,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.878
Iran could now become a threat,

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.410
some in Israel argued.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.355
In fact, the current dynamic

00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:44.447
that you see between Iran and Israel

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:46.542
has its roots more so

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.195
in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:50.984
after the Cold War

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:53.484
than in the events of 1979,

00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:56.181
because at this point, Iran and Israel

00:04:56.181 --> 00:05:00.069
emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.312
and rather than viewing each other

00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:03.788
as potential security partners,

00:05:03.788 --> 00:05:06.000
they increasingly came to view each other

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.558
as rivals and competitors.

00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:11.359
So Israel, who in the 1980s

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:14.884
lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations

00:05:14.884 --> 00:05:18.267
now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:19.561
thinking that it would come

00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.223
at Israel's security interests' expense,

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.355
and instead sought to put Iran

00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:27.889
in increased isolation.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.817
Ironically, this was happening at a time

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:32.884
when Iran was more interested

00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:35.034
in peacemaking with Washington

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.469
than to see to Israel's destruction.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.309
Iran had put itself in isolation

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.176
because of its radicalism,

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:45.095
and after having helped the United States indirectly

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.367
in the war against Iraq in 1991,

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.323
the Iranians were hoping

00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:53.225
that they would be rewarded by being included

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:57.955
in the post-war security architecture of the region.

00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:01.507
But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:03.943
as it would a decade later in Afghanistan,

00:06:03.943 --> 00:06:08.138
and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:11.372
and it is at this point, around 1993, '94,

00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:14.084
that Iran begins to translate

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:16.311
its anti-Israeli ideology

00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.706
into operational policy.

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:20.985
The Iranians believed that whatever they did,

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:23.295
even if they moderated their policies,

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:26.597
the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,

00:06:26.597 --> 00:06:30.251
and the only way Iran could compel Washington

00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.547
to change its position was by imposing a cost

00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:36.860
on the U.S. if it didn't.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.950
The easiest target was the peace process,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.327
and now the Iranian ideological bark

00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:47.566
was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:51.543
and Iran began supporting extensively

00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:54.242
Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously

00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:57.633
had shunned.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.848
In some ways, this sounds paradoxical,

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:02.968
but according to Martin Indyk

00:07:02.968 --> 00:07:04.841
of the Clinton administration,

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.740
the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.281
because the more peace there would be

00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:11.444
between Israel and Palestine,

00:07:11.444 --> 00:07:14.807
the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.

00:07:14.807 --> 00:07:17.943
The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:20.391
So according to Indyk, and these are his words,

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.579
the Iranians had an interest to do us in

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:25.246
on the peace process

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:28.958
in order to defeat our policy of containment.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.324
To defeat our policy of containment,

00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:35.310
not about ideology.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.015
But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,

00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:42.278
all sides have reached out to each other.

00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:45.547
Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.343
reached out to the Iranians to see

00:07:47.343 --> 00:07:49.046
if there were any ways that

00:07:49.046 --> 00:07:52.235
the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.

00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:54.705
Tehran was not interested.

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:57.670
A few years later, the Iranians sent

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.129
a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:05.137
a proposal that revealed that there was some potential

00:08:05.137 --> 00:08:09.000
of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.260
The Bush administration did not even respond.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.080
All sides have never missed an opportunity

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.147
to miss an opportunity.

00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:25.569
But this is not an ancient conflict.

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:28.528
This is not even an ideological conflict.

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:31.322
The ebbs and flows of hostility

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:34.598
have not shifted with ideological zeal,

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:37.200
but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.531
When Iran and Israel's security imperatives

00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.233
dictated collaboration, they did so

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:45.809
in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.

00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:48.725
When Iran's ideological impulses collided

00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:50.955
with its strategic interests,

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:54.618
the strategic interests always prevailed.

00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:57.611
This is good news, because it means

00:08:57.611 --> 00:09:00.197
that neither war nor enmity

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:03.867
is a foregone conclusion.

00:09:03.867 --> 00:09:06.422
But some want war.

00:09:06.422 --> 00:09:09.626
Some believe or say that it's 1938,

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.538
Iran is Germany,

00:09:11.538 --> 00:09:14.704
and Ahmadinejad is Hitler.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:16.569
If we accept this to be true,

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:19.921
that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,

00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.328
Ahmadinejad is Hitler,

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.163
then the question we have to ask ourself is,

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:28.976
who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?

00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:31.842
Who will risk peace?

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:34.456
This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:37.216
at eliminating diplomacy,

00:09:37.216 --> 00:09:39.628
and when you eliminate diplomacy,

00:09:39.628 --> 00:09:42.717
you make war inevitable.

00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:45.832
In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:47.997
no draw, no compromise,

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:51.279
only victory or defeat.

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.469
But rather than making war inevitable

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:57.673
by viewing this as ideological,

00:09:57.673 --> 00:09:59.712
we would be wise to seek ways

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:02.700
to make peace possible.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.196
Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:08.186
only a few decades old

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.812
in a history of 2,500 years,

00:10:10.812 --> 00:10:14.799
and precisely because its roots are geopolitical,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:17.639
it means that solutions can be found,

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:20.326
compromises can be struck,

00:10:20.326 --> 00:10:23.145
however difficult it yet may be.

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:27.137
After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,

00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:30.123
"You don't make peace with your friends.

00:10:30.123 --> 00:10:32.503
You make it with your enemies."

00:10:32.503 --> 00:10:33.938
Thank you.

00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:39.020
(Applause)
