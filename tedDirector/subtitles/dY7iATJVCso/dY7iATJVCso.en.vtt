00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:16.863
This is our life with bees,

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:20.586
and this is our life without bees.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:23.054
Bees are the most important pollinators

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.863
of our fruits and vegetables and flowers

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:29.522
and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.210
More than one third of the world's crop production

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.992
is dependent on bee pollination.

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.829
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.746
pollinating our food intentionally.

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:43.617
They're out there because they need to eat.

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:46.336
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:47.665
from pollen

00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.601
and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.366
They're flower-feeders,

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.300
and as they move from flower to flower,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.771
basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.226
they end up providing this valuable pollination service.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.746
In parts of the world where there are no bees,

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:07.652
or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:11.858
people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:15.542
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.441
with a paintbrush.

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:19.887
Now this business of hand pollination

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:21.973
is actually not that uncommon.

00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:25.325
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.982
with a hand-held vibrator.

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:31.926
Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:37.206
Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:38.986
is held very securely within

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.486
the male part of the flower, the anther,

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:44.860
and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.546
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.669
that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:54.261
and they do this by shaking their flight muscles

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.813
at a frequency similar to the musical note C.

00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:01.399
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.446
and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:07.185
and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.682
and she takes it home as food.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:12.523
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies

00:02:12.523 --> 00:02:15.054
inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes

00:02:15.054 --> 00:02:17.417
because they get much more efficient pollination

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.912
when it's done naturally

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:22.474
and they get better quality tomatoes.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:26.061
So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:27.484
to care about bees.

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:31.656
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,

00:02:31.656 --> 00:02:34.662
and they're absolutely gorgeous.

00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:37.281
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.101
hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem

00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.801
and very few of these beautiful species

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.234
have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.

00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:49.854
Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:53.023
for the other 19,900-plus species

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:55.664
because there's something about honeybees

00:02:55.664 --> 00:02:58.513
that draws people into their world.

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.960
Humans have been drawn to honeybees

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.676
since early recorded history,

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:04.152
mostly to harvest their honey,

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:07.611
which is an amazing natural sweetener.

00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:09.399
I got drawn into the honeybee world

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.484
completely by a fluke.

00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:13.806
I was 18 years old and bored,

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.668
and I picked up a book in the library on bees

00:03:16.668 --> 00:03:18.910
and I spent the night reading it.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.837
I had never thought about insects

00:03:20.837 --> 00:03:22.560
living in complex societies.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.962
It was like the best of science fiction come true.

00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:28.856
And even stranger, there were these people,

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:32.847
these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:36.150
and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.635
So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:42.832
a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:46.239
And I was permanently hooked.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.553
Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:51.709
where the colony is the organism

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.441
and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000

00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:57.369
individual bee organisms.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.701
Now this society has no central authority.

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.297
Nobody's in charge.

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:04.642
So how they come to collective decisions,

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.622
and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.104
how they communicate where the flowers are,

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:14.268
all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.

00:04:14.268 --> 00:04:18.036
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:19.981
is their system of healthcare.

00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:23.466
So bees have social healthcare.

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:27.736
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:30.075
For example, we study hygiene,

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:32.961
where some bees are able to locate and weed out

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:36.128
sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:38.592
and it keeps the colony healthy.

00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:42.019
And more recently, we've been studying resins

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.128
that bees collect from plants.

00:04:44.128 --> 00:04:47.311
So bees fly to some plants and they scrape

00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:49.967
these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:51.545
and they take them back to the nest

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:54.411
where they cement them into the nest architecture

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:56.936
where we call it propolis.

00:04:56.936 --> 00:05:01.558
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:03.502
It's a natural antibiotic.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.681
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.283
within the colony,

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:12.246
and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:15.537
Humans have known about the power of propolis

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.184
since biblical times.

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:20.534
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:22.586
for human medicine,

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:26.250
but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.303
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses

00:05:30.303 --> 00:05:32.992
that have kept them healthy and thriving

00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:37.249
for over 50 million years.

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.598
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:42.397
were reported to be dying en masse,

00:05:42.397 --> 00:05:44.369
first in the United States,

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:48.182
it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:51.668
In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,

00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:54.854
we know we can't afford to lose bees.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.969
So what's going on?

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.058
Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,

00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:04.540
and I'll go through each of these.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.393
The bottom line is,

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:10.445
bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.934
and a dysfunctional food system.

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:15.926
Now we have the best data on honeybees,

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.782
so I'll use them as an example.

00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:21.275
In the United States, bees in fact have been

00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:24.139
in decline since World War II.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.413
We have half the number of managed hives

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:29.427
in the United States now compared to 1945.

00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:33.078
We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:35.824
And the reason is, after World War II,

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:39.152
we changed our farming practices.

00:06:39.152 --> 00:06:41.991
We stopped planting cover crops.

00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.734
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:48.580
which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.184
and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:57.728
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.

00:06:57.728 --> 00:07:01.182
And after World War II, we started using herbicides

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:03.679
to kill off the weeds in our farms.

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:06.460
Many of these weeds are flowering plants

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.393
that bees require for their survival.

00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:14.964
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.

00:07:14.964 --> 00:07:17.529
Now we talk about food deserts,

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:21.779
places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.822
The very farms that used to sustain bees

00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:28.578
are now agricultural food deserts,

00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:31.001
dominated by one or two plant species

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:33.590
like corn and soybeans.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.495
Since World War II, we have been systematically

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:39.394
eliminating many of the flowering plants

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:42.946
that bees need for their survival.

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:45.844
And these monocultures extend even to crops

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:48.391
that are good for bees, like almonds.

00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:52.377
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.388
hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,

00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:59.320
and also because the pollen in an almond blossom

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.500
is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.497
Now, the scale of almond monoculture

00:08:07.497 --> 00:08:10.049
demands that most of our nation's bees,

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:12.785
over 1.5 million hives of bees,

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.777
be transported across the nation

00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:18.128
to pollinate this one crop.

00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:20.773
And they're trucked in in semi-loads,

00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:23.103
and they must be trucked out,

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.842
because after bloom, the almond orchards

00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:31.052
are a vast and flowerless landscape.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.518
Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:37.323
and we're planting more crops that need them.

00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:41.507
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production

00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:45.311
that requires bee pollination.

00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:48.337
And then there's pesticides.

00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:51.681
After World War II, we started using pesticides

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.245
on a large scale, and this became necessary

00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:58.039
because of the monocultures that put out a feast

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.332
for crop pests.

00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:03.273
Recently, researchers from Penn State University

00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:06.570
have started looking at the pesticide residue

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.120
in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.711
and they've found that every batch of pollen

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.718
that a honeybee collects

00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:19.505
has at least six detectable pesticides in it,

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:23.548
and this includes every class of insecticides,

00:09:23.548 --> 00:09:26.391
herbicides, fungicides,

00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:29.971
and even inert and unlabeled ingredients

00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.543
that are part of the pesticide formulation

00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:36.765
that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.

00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:42.407
This small bee is holding up a large mirror.

00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:46.855
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?

00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:49.835
One of these class of insecticides,

00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:51.210
the neonicontinoids,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.470
is making headlines around the world right now.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.916
You've probably heard about it.

00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:56.974
This is a new class of insecticides.

00:09:56.974 --> 00:10:00.133
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.576
a leaf-eating insect,

00:10:01.576 --> 00:10:02.810
would take a bite of the plant

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.150
and get a lethal dose and die.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.973
If one of these neonics, we call them,

00:10:08.973 --> 00:10:11.427
is applied in a high concentration,

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:13.689
such as in this ground application,

00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:16.157
enough of the compound moves through the plant

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.369
and gets into the pollen and the nectar,

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:20.473
where a bee can consume, in this case,

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:23.491
a high dose of this neurotoxin

00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.640
that makes the bee twitch and die.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.813
In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,

00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:34.756
it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:37.747
and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant

00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:39.715
and gets into the pollen and nectar,

00:10:39.715 --> 00:10:42.258
and if a bee consumes this lower dose,

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:43.600
either nothing happens

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.188
or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.900
and she may not find her way home.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.032
And on top of everything else, bees have

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:55.300
their own set of diseases and parasites.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.160
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.465
It's called varroa destructor.

00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:01.569
It's aptly named.

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:04.181
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite

00:11:04.181 --> 00:11:06.555
that compromises the bee's immune system

00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:09.326
and circulates viruses.

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:12.255
Let me put this all together for you.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.922
I don't know what it feels like to a bee

00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:17.623
to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,

00:11:17.623 --> 00:11:20.762
and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,

00:11:20.762 --> 00:11:25.890
but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.122
and I know how difficult it is for me to get

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.911
to the grocery store to get good nutrition.

00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:34.957
But what if I lived in a food desert?

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:37.452
And what if I had to travel a long distance

00:11:37.452 --> 00:11:39.325
to get to the grocery store,

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:42.199
and I finally got my weak body out there

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:44.343
and I consumed, in my food,

00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:47.144
enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:49.900
that I couldn't find my way home?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.087
And this is what we mean by multiple

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:56.790
and interacting causes of death.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.979
And it's not just our honeybees.

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.854
All of our beautiful wild species of bees

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:06.025
are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.576
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.626
They're providing the pollination insurance

00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:13.244
alongside our honeybees.

00:12:13.244 --> 00:12:15.667
We need all of our bees.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.208
So what are we going to do?

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:20.622
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer

00:12:20.622 --> 00:12:22.885
that we've created?

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:26.702
It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.

00:12:26.702 --> 00:12:30.285
Every one of you out there can help bees

00:12:30.285 --> 00:12:34.750
in two very direct and easy ways.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.705
Plant bee-friendly flowers,

00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:39.838
and don't contaminate these flowers,

00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:42.500
this bee food, with pesticides.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.834
So go online and search for flowers

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:49.246
that are native to your area and plant them.

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:51.369
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:53.943
Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,

00:12:53.943 --> 00:12:55.473
in your boulevards.

00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:59.086
Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,

00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:01.667
community spaces, meadows.

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:03.416
Set aside farmland.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.116
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers

00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:08.287
that blooms over the entire growing season,

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.181
from spring to fall.

00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.879
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:17.333
but also for migrating butterflies and birds

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.309
and other wildlife.

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:22.749
And we need to think carefully about putting back in

00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:25.934
cover crops to nourish our soil

00:13:25.934 --> 00:13:28.955
and nourish our bees.

00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:32.218
And we need to diversify our farms.

00:13:32.218 --> 00:13:36.000
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.856
to disrupt the agricultural food desert

00:13:39.856 --> 00:13:43.146
and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system

00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:45.377
that we've created.

00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:48.761
So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.779
to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:54.807
but when bees have access to good nutrition,

00:13:54.807 --> 00:13:56.993
we have access to good nutrition

00:13:56.993 --> 00:13:59.408
through their pollination services.

00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:01.944
And when bees have access to good nutrition,

00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:05.543
they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:06.961
their healthcare,

00:14:06.961 --> 00:14:11.059
that they have relied on for millions of years.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:15.908
So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,

00:14:15.908 --> 00:14:20.358
is that every one of us needs to behave

00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:25.138
a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,

00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:28.170
where each of our individual actions

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.276
can contribute to a grand solution,

00:14:31.276 --> 00:14:32.963
an emergent property,

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:34.944
that's much greater than the mere sum

00:14:34.944 --> 00:14:37.689
of our individual actions.

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:42.839
So let the small act of planting flowers

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:46.166
and keeping them free of pesticides

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:50.381
be the driver of large-scale change.

00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:53.417
On behalf of the bees, thank you.

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:57.540
(Applause)

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.508
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.

00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:04.664
The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,

00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:06.892
is there any sign of things bottoming out?

00:15:06.892 --> 00:15:09.671
What's your hope/depression level on this?

00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:10.285
Maria Spivak: Yeah.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.238
At least in the United States,

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:14.590
an average of 30 percent of all bee hives

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.717
are lost every winter.

00:15:16.717 --> 00:15:18.522
About 20 years ago,

00:15:18.522 --> 00:15:20.858
we were at a 15-percent loss.

00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:22.979
So it's getting precarious.

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:25.586
CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --
MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:29.140
CA: Thirty percent a year.
MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.790
and so they can maintain the same number,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.111
they can recuperate some of their loss.

00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:35.729
We're kind of at a tipping point.

00:15:35.729 --> 00:15:38.598
We can't really afford to lose that many more.

00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:40.418
We need to be really appreciative

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:43.771
of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.

00:15:43.771 --> 00:15:44.921
CA: Thank you.

00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:50.291
(Applause)
