00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:16.268
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.101
They're exactly what they sound like.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.654
They are these huge collections of galaxies,

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.909
bound together by their mutual gravity.

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.571
So most of the points that you see on the screen

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.100
are not individual stars,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.936
but collections of stars, or galaxies.

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.267
Now, by showing you some of these images,

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.014
I hope that you will quickly see that

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:37.694
galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:39.187
but more than that,

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.850
I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.403
they are surprising,

00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:44.820
and they're useful.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.351
Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.

00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:51.987
And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters

00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:53.852
is to describe the experiments

00:00:53.852 --> 00:00:55.405
that you can do with them.

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.685
And I think there are four major types,

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.269
and the first type that I want to describe

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.488
is probing the very big.

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:04.183
So, how big?

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:08.434
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.403
It is so massive that the light passing through it

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.018
is being bent, it's being distorted

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.527
by the extreme gravity of this cluster.

00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:18.331
And, in fact, if you look very carefully

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.031
you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.580
Now, to give you a number,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.363
this particular galaxy cluster

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:28.571
has a mass of over one million billion suns.

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.884
It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get.

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:33.385
But more than their mass,

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.359
they have this additional feature.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.703
They are essentially isolated systems,

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:39.925
so if we like, we can think of them

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:43.195
as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:45.197
And many of the questions that we might have

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:47.165
about the universe at large scales,

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:49.080
such as, how does gravity work?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.112
might be answered by studying these systems.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.445
So that was very big.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.330
The second things is very hot.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.113
Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,

00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:01.030
and I subtract away all of the starlight,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.825
what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.310
This is in false color.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.659
It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.320
And the question is, if it's not galaxies,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.519
what is emitting this light?

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.419
The answer is hot gas,

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.242
million-degree gas --

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:17.899
in fact, it's plasma.

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.558
And the reason why it's so hot

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:21.538
goes back to the previous slide.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:24.278
The extreme gravity of these systems

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.320
is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.902
and great speeds means great temperatures.

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:31.621
So this is the main idea,

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.987
but science is a rough draft.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.538
There are many basic properties about this plasma

00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:38.236
that still confuse us,

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.569
still puzzle us,

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.655
and still push our understanding

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.694
of the physics of the very hot.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:47.121
Third thing: probing the very small.

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:49.967
Now, to explain this, I need to tell you

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.987
a very disturbing fact.

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:54.777
Most of the universe's matter

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:56.588
is not made up of atoms.

00:02:56.588 --> 00:02:58.538
You were lied to.

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:01.665
Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious,

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:03.787
which we call dark matter.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:07.454
Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much,

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.122
except through gravity,

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.734
and of course we would like to learn more about it.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.277
If you're a particle physicist,

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:14.786
you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together.

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:16.776
And dark matter is no exception.

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:18.436
Well, how do we do this?

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.927
To answer that question,

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:21.320
I'm going to have to ask another one,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.486
which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.796
Here is an image.

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:29.987
Since galaxy clusters are representative

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:33.111
slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.

00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:35.234
They are mostly made up of dark matter,

00:03:35.234 --> 00:03:37.787
and that's what you see in this bluish purple.

00:03:37.787 --> 00:03:39.404
The red represents the hot gas,

00:03:39.404 --> 00:03:41.371
and, of course, you can see many galaxies.

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.736
What's happened is a particle accelerator

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.627
at a huge, huge scale.

00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:47.404
And this is very important,

00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:49.287
because what it means is that very, very small

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:52.371
effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,

00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:54.550
might be compounded and compounded

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.359
into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature.

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.871
So, it's very funny.

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:01.819
The reason why galaxy clusters

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.485
can teach us about dark matter,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:05.235
the reason why galaxy clusters

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.788
can teach us about the physics of the very small,

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:10.819
is precisely because they are so very big.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.904
Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.954
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:20.237
Okay, if there's anything stranger

00:04:20.237 --> 00:04:22.654
I think it has to be dark energy.

00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:24.371
If I throw a ball into the air,

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.169
I expect it to go up.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.293
What I don't expect is that it go up

00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:30.459
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.204
Similarly, cosmologists understand why

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:34.786
the universe is expanding.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.954
They don't understand why it's expanding

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:38.892
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:40.570
They give the cause of this

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.162
accelerated expansion a name,

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:44.046
and they call it dark energy.

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:46.734
And, again, we want to learn more about it.

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.121
So, one particular question that we have is,

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.816
how does dark energy affect the universe

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:53.434
at the largest scales?

00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.893
Depending on how strong it is,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:58.154
maybe structure forms faster or slower.

00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:00.703
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure

00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:03.041
of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:05.370
Here is a computer simulation.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.498
And we need a way to simplify it.

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:11.069
Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.787
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,

00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.453
the most important thing to do

00:05:15.453 --> 00:05:17.234
is not to model the little positions

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:20.155
of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.

00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:21.820
The most important thing to do is

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.821
to track the two biggest parts.

00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:27.653
Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe

00:05:27.653 --> 00:05:29.120
at the largest scales

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.871
by tracking its biggest pieces

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:34.862
and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.

00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:37.818
So, as I come to a close,

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:39.820
you might feel slightly cheated.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.070
I mean, I began by talking about

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.153
how galaxy clusters are useful,

00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:45.653
and I've given some reasons,

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:48.253
but what is their use really?

00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:50.370
Well, to answer this,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.986
I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.472
when he was asked about cars.

00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:55.831
He had this to say:

00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.120
"If I had asked people what they wanted,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.903
they would have said faster horses."

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:03.404
Today, we as a society are faced

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:05.622
with many, many difficult problems.

00:06:05.622 --> 00:06:09.453
And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious.

00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:11.620
They are not faster horses.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.862
They will require an enormous amount of

00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:15.568
scientific ingenuity.

00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:17.154
So, yes, we need to focus,

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:18.904
yes, we need to concentrate,

00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:20.870
but we also need to remember that

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.705
innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:25.037
these things come

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:26.725
when we broaden our field of vision

00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:28.065
when we step back

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:29.414
when we zoom out.

00:06:29.414 --> 00:06:31.237
And I can't think of a better way to do this than

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:34.992
by studying the universe around us. Thanks.

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:37.941
(Applause)
