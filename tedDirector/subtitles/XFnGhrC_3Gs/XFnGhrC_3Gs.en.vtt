00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:20.331
As a magician, I try to create images
that make people stop and think.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.236
I also try to challenge myself

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.236
to do things that doctors
say are not possible.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:32.236
I was buried alive
in New York City in a coffin,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.113
buried alive in a coffin
in April, 1999, for a week.

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.383
I lived there with nothing but water.

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:44.236
And it ended up being so much fun

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.236
that I decided I could pursue
doing more of these things.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.692
The next one is I froze myself
in a block of ice

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.236
for three days and three nights
in New York City.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.957
That one was way more difficult
than I had expected.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.236
The one after that, I stood
on top of a hundred-foot pillar

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.236
for 36 hours.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.759
I began to hallucinate so hard

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:10.486
that the buildings that were behind me
started to look like big animal heads.

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:13.236
So, next I went to London.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.236
In London I lived
in a glass box for 44 days

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.236
with nothing but water.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
It was, for me, one of the most difficult
things I'd ever done,

00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:25.367
but it was also the most beautiful.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.236
There was so many skeptics,
especially the press in London,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.236
that they started flying cheeseburgers
on helicopters around my box to tempt me.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.291
(Laughter)

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:39.236
So, I felt very validated

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.239
when the New England Journal of Medicine
actually used the research for science.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.236
My next pursuit was I wanted to see
how long I could go without breathing,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.677
like how long I could survive
with nothing, not even air.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.484
I didn't realize that it would become
the most amazing journey of my life.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.236
As a young magician,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.236
I was obsessed with Houdini
and his underwater challenges.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.236
So, I began, early on,
competing against the other kids,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.236
seeing how long I could stay underwater
while they went up and down to breathe,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.236
you know, five times,
while I stayed under on one breath.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.236
By the time I was a teenager,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.236
I was able to hold my breath
for three minutes and 30 seconds.

00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:25.119
I would later find out
that was Houdini's personal record.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.236
In 1987 I heard of a story

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.236
about a boy that fell through ice
and was trapped under a river.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.236
He was underneath,
not breathing for 45 minutes.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.236
When the rescue workers came,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.236
they resuscitated him
and there was no brain damage.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.563
His core temperature
had dropped to 77 degrees.

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.236
As a magician,
I think everything is possible.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.451
And I think if something
is done by one person,

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.964
it can be done by others.

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:00.370
I started to think,

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:04.102
if the boy could survive
without breathing for that long,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:05.990
there must be a way that I could do it.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.236
So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.474
And I asked him, how long
is it possible to go without breathing,

00:03:12.498 --> 00:03:14.878
like how long could I go without air?

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:17.236
And he said to me that anything
over six minutes

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.470
you have a serious risk
of hypoxic brain damage.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.110
So, I took that as a challenge, basically.

00:03:26.134 --> 00:03:27.236
(Laughter)

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.787
My first try, I figured
that I could do something similar,

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:36.236
and I created a water tank,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.804
and I filled it with ice
and freezing cold water.

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:42.236
And I stayed inside of that water tank

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.236
hoping my core temperature
would start to drop.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.663
And I was shivering.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:50.180
In my first attempt to hold my breath,
I couldn't even last a minute.

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:52.718
So, I realized that was completely
not going to work.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.180
I went to talk to a doctor friend --

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.236
and I asked him, "How could I do that?"

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.689
"I want to hold my breath for a really
long time. How could it be done?"

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.236
And he said, "David, you're a magician,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.236
create the illusion of not breathing,
it will be much easier."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.913
(Laughter)

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:20.236
So, he came up with this idea
of creating a rebreather,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.881
with a CO2 scrubber,

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:27.236
which was basically
a tube from Home Depot,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.236
with a balloon duct-taped to it,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.236
that he thought we could put inside of me,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.236
and somehow be able to circulate
the air and rebreathe

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.826
with this thing in me.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:43.236
This is a little hard to watch.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.287
But this is that attempt.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.236
So, that clearly wasn't going to work.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.404
(Laughter)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.236
Then I actually started thinking
about liquid breathing.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.236
There is a chemical
that's called perflubron.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.236
And it's so high in oxygen levels
that in theory you could breathe it.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.236
So, I got my hands on that chemical,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.236
filled the sink up with it,
and stuck my face in the sink

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.236
and tried to breathe that in,
which was really impossible.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.236
It's basically like trying
to breathe, as a doctor said,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.546
while having an elephant
standing on your chest.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.703
So, that idea disappeared.

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:28.973
Then I started thinking,

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:33.236
would it be possible to hook up
a heart/lung bypass machine

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.236
and have a surgery where it was
a tube going into my artery,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.763
and then appear to not breathe
while they were oxygenating my blood?

00:05:40.582 --> 00:05:43.771
Which was another insane idea, obviously.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.399
Then I thought about
the craziest idea of all the ideas:

00:05:49.787 --> 00:05:51.236
to actually do it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.307
(Laughter)

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.743
To actually try to hold
my breath past the point

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:58.698
that doctors would
consider you brain dead.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:05.236
So, I started researching
into pearl divers.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.236
You know, because they go down
for four minutes on one breath.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.836
And when I was researching pearl divers,
I found the world of free-diving.

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:16.740
It was the most amazing thing
that I ever discovered, pretty much.

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.236
There is many different
aspects to free-diving.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.784
There is depth records,
where people go as deep as they can.

00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:25.708
And then there is static apnea.

00:06:25.732 --> 00:06:28.236
That's holding your breath
as long as you can

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.236
in one place without moving.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.236
That was the one that I studied.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.356
The first thing that I learned
is when you're holding your breath,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.236
you should never move at all;
that wastes energy.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.899
And that depletes oxygen,

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.762
and it builds up CO2 in your blood.

00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:44.654
So, I learned never to move.

00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:47.236
And I learned how to slow
my heart rate down.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.451
I had to remain
perfectly still and just relax

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:53.236
and think that I wasn't in my body,
and just control that.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.236
And then I learned how to purge.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.713
Purging is basically hyperventilating.

00:06:57.737 --> 00:06:58.929
You blow in and out --

00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:03.236
(Breathing loudly)

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.237
You do that, you get lightheaded,
you get tingling.

00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.566
And you're really ridding
your body of CO2.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.843
So, when you hold your breath,
it's infinitely easier.

00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:16.279
Then I learned that you have
to take a huge breath,

00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:20.236
and just hold and relax
and never let any air out,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.755
and just hold and relax
through all the pain.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.825
Every morning, this is for months,

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:28.689
I would wake up
and the first thing that I would do

00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:31.046
is I would hold my breath

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:36.236
for, out of 52 minutes,
I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.451
So, basically what that means
is I would purge,

00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:40.336
I'd breathe really hard for a minute.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.629
And I would hold, immediately after,
for five and a half minutes.

00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:47.236
Then I would breathe again for a minute,
purging as hard as I can,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.837
then immediately after that I would hold
again for five and a half minutes.

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.772
I would repeat this process
eight times in a row.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:57.236
Out of 52 minutes, you're only
breathing for eight minutes.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.236
At the end of that
you're completely fried, your brain.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.451
You feel like you're walking
around in a daze.

00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:04.236
And you have these awful headaches.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.236
Basically, I'm not the best person
to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.594
I started learning
about the world-record holder.

00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:12.236
His name is Tom Sietas.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.236
And this guy is perfectly built
for holding his breath.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.236
He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.236
And his total lung capacity
is twice the size of an average person.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.747
I'm six foot one, and fat.

00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:30.236
We'll say big-boned.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.236
(Laughter)

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.236
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.770
So, everything that I put into my body,
I considered as medicine.

00:08:40.794 --> 00:08:45.236
Every bit of food was exactly
what it was for its nutritional value.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.236
I ate really small controlled portions
throughout the day.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.457
And I started to really adapt my body.

00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:55.623
[Individual results may vary]

00:08:55.647 --> 00:08:58.236
(Laughter)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.885
The thinner I was, the longer
I was able to hold my breath.

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:05.236
And by eating so well
and training so hard,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.760
my resting heart-rate dropped
to 38 beats per minute.

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.988
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.851
In four months of training,

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:16.348
I was able to hold my breath
for over seven minutes.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.236
I wanted to try holding
my breath everywhere.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.594
I wanted to try it
in the most extreme situations

00:09:22.618 --> 00:09:26.913
to see if I could slow
my heart rate down under duress.

00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:29.380
(Laughter)

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.236
I decided that I was going
to break the world record

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.837
live on prime-time television.

00:09:35.861 --> 00:09:39.236
The world record was
eight minutes and 58 seconds,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.451
held by Tom Sietas, that guy
with the whale lungs I told you about.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.673
I assumed that I could put
a water tank at Lincoln Center

00:09:47.697 --> 00:09:51.236
and if I stayed there a week not eating,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.236
I would get comfortable in that situation
and I would slow my metabolism,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.403
which I was sure would help me
hold my breath

00:09:57.427 --> 00:09:59.196
longer than I had been able to do it.

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:01.554
I was completely wrong.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:06.642
I entered the sphere a week
before the scheduled air date.

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:09.389
And I thought everything
seemed to be on track.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.236
Two days before my big
breath-hold attempt, for the record,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.236
the producers of my television special

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:22.126
thought that just watching somebody
holding their breath, and almost drowning,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.236
is too boring for television.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.236
(Laughter)

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.644
So, I had to add handcuffs,
while holding my breath, to escape from.

00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:33.492
This was a critical mistake.

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:38.236
Because of the movement,
I was wasting oxygen.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.502
And by seven minutes I had gone
into these awful convulsions.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.994
By 7:08, I started to black out.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.236
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.692
they had to pull my body out
and bring me back.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.236
I had failed on every level.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.236
(Laughter)

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.138
So, naturally, the only way out
of the slump that I could think of was,

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:12.682
I decided to call Oprah.

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:16.143
(Laughter)

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.236
I told her that I wanted to up the ante

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.236
and hold my breath longer
than any human being ever had.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.018
This was a different record.

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:26.552
This was a pure O2 static apnea record

00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:29.981
that Guinness had set
the world record at 13 minutes.

00:11:31.528 --> 00:11:37.071
So, basically you breathe pure O2 first,
oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,

00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:39.158
and you are able to hold much longer.

00:11:40.818 --> 00:11:45.244
I realized that my real competition
was the beaver.

00:11:45.268 --> 00:11:48.014
(Laughter)

00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:52.236
(Laughter ends)

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.236
In January of '08,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.877
Oprah gave me four months
to prepare and train.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:00.893
So, I would sleep
in a hypoxic tent every night.

00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:05.236
A hypoxic tent is a tent
that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.933
So, it's like base camp, Everest.

00:12:07.957 --> 00:12:13.236
What that does is, you start building up
the red bloodcell count in your body,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.498
which helps you carry oxygen better.

00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:20.236
Every morning, again,
after getting out of that tent,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.236
your brain is completely wiped out.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.236
My first attempt on pure O2,
I was able to go up to 15 minutes.

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:30.236
So, it was a pretty big success.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.308
The neurosurgeon
pulled me out of the water

00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:37.236
because in his mind, at 15 minutes
your brain is done, you're brain dead.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.599
So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.

00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:44.212
There was one person there
that was definitely not impressed.

00:12:45.022 --> 00:12:46.646
It was my ex-girlfriend.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.130
While I was breaking the record
underwater for the first time,

00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:53.236
she was sifting through my Blackberry,
checking all my messages.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.236
(Laughter)

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.779
My brother had a picture of it.
It is really --

00:12:58.803 --> 00:13:00.415
(Laughter)

00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:03.708
(Laughter ends)

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:08.236
I then announced that I was going
to go for Sietas' record, publicly.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.656
And what he did in response,
is he went on Regis and Kelly,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.237
and broke his old record.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:19.537
Then his main competitor
went out and broke his record.

00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:24.236
So, he suddenly pushed the record up to
16 minutes and 32 seconds.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.113
Which was three minutes
longer than I had prepared.

00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:28.636
It was longer than the record.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.236
I wanted to get the Science Times
to document this.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.236
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.

00:13:36.838 --> 00:13:40.236
So, I did what any person

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.949
seriously pursuing scientific
advancement would do.

00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:48.236
I walked into the New York Times offices
and did card tricks to everybody.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.196
(Laughter)

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.641
So, I don't know if it was the magic
or the lure of the Cayman Islands,

00:13:55.665 --> 00:13:57.236
but John Tierney flew down

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.236
and did a piece on the seriousness
of breath-holding.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.784
While he was there,
I tried to impress him, of course.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:05.236
And I did a dive down to 160 feet,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.746
which is basically the height
of a 16 story building,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.236
and as I was coming up,
I blacked out underwater,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.546
which is really dangerous;
that's how you drown.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.924
Luckily, Kirk had seen me
and he swam over and pulled me up.

00:14:18.948 --> 00:14:21.236
So, I started full focus.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.236
I completely trained to get
my breath-hold time up

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.236
for what I needed to do.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.546
But there was no way to prepare
for the live television aspect of it,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.236
being on Oprah.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.909
But in practice, I would do it
face down, floating on the pool.

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:41.617
But for TV they wanted me to be upright
so they could see my face, basically.

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:46.236
The other problem
was the suit was so buoyant

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.236
that they had to strap my feet in
to keep me from floating up.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.236
So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet
into the straps that were loose,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.265
which was a real problem for me.

00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.236
That made me extremely nervous,
raising the heart rate.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.236
Then, what they also did was,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.679
which we never did before,
is there was a heart-rate monitor.

00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:08.236
And it was right next to the sphere.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.499
So, every time my heart would beat,
I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:13.545
you know, the ticking, really loud.

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:15.713
Which was making me more nervous.

00:15:15.737 --> 00:15:18.424
And there was no way to slow
my heart rate down.

00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:24.236
Normally, I would start
at 38 beats per minute,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.356
and while holding my breath,
it would drop to 12 beats per minute,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.236
which is pretty unusual.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.641
(Laughter)

00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:40.397
This time it started at 120 beats,
and it never went down.

00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:44.236
I spent the first five minutes underwater

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.236
desperately trying to slow
my heart rate down.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.912
I was just sitting there thinking,

00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:51.624
"I've got to slow this down.
I'm going to fail."

00:15:51.648 --> 00:15:53.236
And I was getting more nervous.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.403
And the heart rate
just kept going up and up,

00:15:55.427 --> 00:15:57.313
all the way up to 150 beats.

00:16:00.247 --> 00:16:03.913
Basically it's the same thing that created
my downfall at Lincoln Center.

00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:05.294
It was a waste of O2.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.784
When I made it to the halfway
mark, at eight minutes,

00:16:08.808 --> 00:16:11.236
I was 100 percent certain

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.403
that I was not going
to be able to make this.

00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:15.572
There was no way for me to do it.

00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:19.236
I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.236
to doing this breath-hold thing,
if I had cracked early,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.236
it would be a whole show
about how depressed I am.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.236
(Laughter)

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.236
So, I figured I'm better off just fighting
and staying there until I black out,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.499
at least then they can pull me out
and take care of me and all that.

00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:37.632
(Laughter)

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.308
I kept pushing to 10 minutes.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:44.044
At 10 minutes you start getting all
these really strong tingling sensations

00:16:44.068 --> 00:16:45.648
in your fingers and toes.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.608
And I knew that that was blood shunting,

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.126
when the blood rushes away
from your extremities

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.271
to provide oxygen to your vital organs.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.871
At 11 minutes I started feeling
throbbing sensations in my legs,

00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:03.236
and my lips started
to feel really strange.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.236
At minute 12 I started
to have ringing in my ears,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.236
and I started to feel my arm going numb.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.499
And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember
arm numb means heart attack.

00:17:13.523 --> 00:17:16.236
So, I started to really
get really paranoid.

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:20.202
Then at 13 minutes, maybe
because of the hypochondria,

00:17:20.226 --> 00:17:24.236
I started feeling pains all over my chest.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.313
It was awful.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.338
(Laughter)

00:17:26.362 --> 00:17:30.236
At 14 minutes,
I had these awful contractions,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.236
like this urge to breathe.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.902
(Laughter)

00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:39.131
(Laughter ends)

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.236
At 15 minutes I was suffering
major O2 deprivation to the heart.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.236
And I started having
ischemia to the heart.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.085
My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,

00:17:51.109 --> 00:17:56.236
to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.236
It would skip a beat.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.660
It would start. It would stop.
And I felt all this.

00:18:00.684 --> 00:18:03.351
And I was sure that I was going
to have a heart attack.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.236
So, at 16 minutes what I did
is I slid my feet out

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.824
because I knew that if I did go out,
if I did have a heart attack,

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:13.655
they'd have to jump into the binding
and take my feet out

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:14.822
before pulling me up.

00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:16.230
I was really nervous.

00:18:16.254 --> 00:18:18.908
I let my feet out,
and I started floating to the top.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.439
And I didn't take my head out.

00:18:20.463 --> 00:18:23.399
But I was just floating there
waiting for my heart to stop,

00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:24.423
just waiting.

00:18:24.447 --> 00:18:28.236
They had doctors with the "Pst,"
you know, sitting there waiting.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.803
And then suddenly I hear screaming.

00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:32.937
And I think that there
is some weird thing --

00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:35.236
that I had died or something had happened.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.236
And then I realized
that I had made it to 16:32.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.236
So, with the energy
of everybody that was there,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.236
I decided to keep pushing.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.706
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.136
(Applause)

00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:56.236
(Applause ends)

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.022
As though that wasn't enough,
what I did immediately after

00:18:59.046 --> 00:19:00.436
is I went to Quest Labs

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.964
and had them take every blood
sample that they could

00:19:02.988 --> 00:19:05.615
to test for everything
and to see where my levels were,

00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:07.629
so the doctors could use it, once again.

00:19:07.653 --> 00:19:09.669
I also didn't want anybody to question it.

00:19:09.693 --> 00:19:13.236
I had the world record and I wanted
to make sure it was legitimate.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.236
So, I get to New York City the next day,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.499
I'm walking out of the Apple store,

00:19:19.523 --> 00:19:21.771
and this kid walks up to me
he's like, "Yo, D!"

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:23.236
I'm like "Yeah?"

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.236
He said, "If you really
held your breath that long,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.236
why'd you come out of the water dry?"

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.236
I was like "What?"

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.236
(Laughter)

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.236
And that's my life. So --

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.392
(Laughter)

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.356
As a magician,
I try to show things to people

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.236
that seem impossible.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.741
And I think magic,

00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:48.236
whether I'm holding my breath
or shuffling a deck of cards,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.236
is pretty simple.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.842
It's practice, it's training,
and it's -- (Sobs)

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.522
It's practice, it's training
and experimenting,

00:19:57.546 --> 00:19:58.817
(Sobs)

00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:01.970
while pushing through the pain
to be the best that I can be.

00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:05.403
And that's what magic
is to me, so, thank you.

00:20:05.427 --> 00:20:08.934
(Applause)
