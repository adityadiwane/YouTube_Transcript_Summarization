00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.321
This is really a two-hour presentation
I give to high school students,

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:29.596
cut down to three minutes.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.261
And it all started one day
on a plane, on my way to TED,

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:33.579
seven years ago.

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:37.976
And in the seat next to me
was a high school student, a teenager,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.007
and she came from a really poor family.

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:42.976
And she wanted to make
something of her life,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.039
and she asked me a simple little question.

00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:47.008
She said, "What leads to success?"

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:48.411
And I felt really badly,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.896
because I couldn't give her a good answer.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.976
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.730
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle
of a room of successful people!

00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:59.365
So why don't I ask them
what helped them succeed,

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.103
and pass it on to kids?

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:05.426
So here we are, seven years,
500 interviews later,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.390
and I'm going to tell you
what really leads to success

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:09.779
and makes TEDsters tick.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:11.976
And the first thing is passion.

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:15.319
Freeman Thomas says,
"I'm driven by my passion."

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.223
TEDsters do it for love;
they don't do it for money.

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:21.731
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay
someone to do what I do."

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.166
And the interesting thing is:

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.381
if you do it for love,
the money comes anyway.

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.976
Work! Rupert Murdoch said
to me, "It's all hard work.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.083
Nothing comes easily.
But I have a lot of fun."

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:34.977
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.477
(Laughter)

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.247
TEDsters do have fun working.
And they work hard.

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.224
I figured, they're not workaholics.
They're workafrolics.

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:43.838
(Laughter)

00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:44.919
Good!

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:45.944
(Applause)

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:49.314
Alex Garden says, "To be successful,
put your nose down in something

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:50.584
and get damn good at it."

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:53.450
There's no magic;
it's practice, practice, practice.

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:54.493
And it's focus.

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:56.251
Norman Jewison said to me,

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.267
"I think it all has to do
with focusing yourself on one thing."

00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:00.838
And push!

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:03.223
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:05.889
Physically, mentally,
you've got to push, push, push."

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:08.524
You've got to push through shyness
and self-doubt.

00:02:08.548 --> 00:02:10.976
Goldie Hawn says,
"I always had self-doubts.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.096
I wasn't good enough;
I wasn't smart enough.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.663
I didn't think I'd make it."

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:17.303
Now it's not always easy to push yourself,

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:19.415
and that's why they invented mothers.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.439
(Laughter)

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.000
(Applause)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
Frank Gehry said to me,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.370
"My mother pushed me."

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:27.608
(Laughter)

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:28.648
Serve!

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:32.466
Sherwin Nuland says,
"It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:35.203
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.

00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:36.477
The first thing I say is:

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.403
"OK, well you can't serve yourself;

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.664
you've got to serve others
something of value.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.225
Because that's the way
people really get rich."

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:45.099
Ideas!

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.976
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.976
founding the first micro-computer
software company."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.976
And there's no magic to creativity
in coming up with ideas --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.335
it's just doing some very simple things.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.976
And I give lots of evidence.

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:01.405
Persist!

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.800
Joe Kraus says,

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:05.418
"Persistence is the number
one reason for our success."

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:09.374
You've got to persist through failure.
You've got to persist through crap!

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:12.913
Which of course means "Criticism,
Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."

00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:15.703
(Laughter)

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:19.446
So, the answer to this question is simple:

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.595
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:22.812
(Laughter)

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:25.574
Or failing that, do
the eight things -- and trust me,

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.818
these are the big eight things
that lead to success.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.561
Thank you TEDsters
for all your interviews!

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:34.585
(Applause)
