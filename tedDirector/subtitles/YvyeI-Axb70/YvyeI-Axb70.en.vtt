00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.579
Take a look at this drawing.

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.183
Can you tell what it is?

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.930
I'm a molecular biologist by training,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.533
and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.625
They're usually referred to as a model figure,

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.359
a drawing that shows how we think

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.023
a cellular or molecular process occurs.

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:31.522
This particular drawing is of a process

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:35.845
called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:38.455
It's a process by which a molecule can get

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.693
from the outside of the cell to the inside

00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:43.230
by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.050
that then gets internalized by the cell.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.885
There's a problem with this drawing, though,

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:50.517
and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.982
From lots of experiments,

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:53.817
from lots of different scientists,

00:00:53.817 --> 00:00:56.813
we know a lot about what these molecules look like,

00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:58.495
how they move around in the cell,

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.320
and that this is all taking place

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.310
in an incredibly dynamic environment.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.783
So in collaboration with a clathrin
expert Tomas Kirchhausen,

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:09.102
we decided to create a new kind of model figure

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.126
that showed all of that.

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:12.862
So we start outside of the cell.

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:14.510
Now we're looking inside.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.590
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.878
that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.

00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:21.575
Through connections with a membrane,

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.742
clathrin is able to deform the membrane

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:25.155
and form this sort of a cup

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.462
that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.246
that's now capturing some of the proteins

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:30.900
that were outside of the cell.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.398
Proteins are coming in now that
basically pinch off this vesicle,

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.982
making it separate from the rest of the membrane,

00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:39.374
and now clathrin is basically done with its job,

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:40.612
and so proteins are coming in now —

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:42.558
we've covered them yellow and orange —

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:45.100
that are responsible for taking
apart this clathrin cage.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.382
And so all of these proteins
can get basically recycled

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:49.918
and used all over again.

00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:53.327
These processes are too small to be seen directly,

00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:55.159
even with the best microscopes,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.790
so animations like this provide a really powerful way

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.808
of visualizing a hypothesis.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:02.654
Here's another illustration,

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:05.390
and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.895
that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.414
And again, this is a vast oversimplification

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.158
and doesn't begin to show

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:15.640
what we actually know about these processes.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.855
You might be surprised to know

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:20.622
that these simple drawings are the only way

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:24.454
that most biologists visualize
their molecular hypotheses.

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:25.482
Why?

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.472
Because creating movies of processes

00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:30.486
as we think they actually occur is really hard.

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.119
I spent months in Hollywood
learning 3D animation software,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.400
and I spend months on each animation,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.750
and that's just time that most
researchers can't afford.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.950
The payoffs can be huge, though.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.334
Molecular animations are unparalleled

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:47.775
in their ability to convey a great deal of information

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:51.367
to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:52.870
And I'm working on a new project now

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.308
called "The Science of HIV"

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:56.670
where I'll be animating the entire life cycle

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.774
of the HIV virus as accurately as possible

00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:01.735
and all in molecular detail.

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:03.886
The animation will feature data

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:06.862
from thousands of researchers
collected over decades,

00:03:06.862 --> 00:03:09.942
data on what this virus looks like,

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:13.030
how it's able to infect cells in our body,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.002
and how therapeutics are
helping to combat infection.

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.331
Over the years, I found that animations

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.150
aren't just useful for communicating an idea,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.646
but they're also really useful

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:25.958
for exploring a hypothesis.

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.152
Biologists for the most part are
still using a paper and pencil

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:31.374
to visualize the processes they study,

00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.854
and with the data we have now,
that's just not good enough anymore.

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:37.270
The process of creating an animation

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.927
can act as a catalyst that allows researchers

00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:42.878
to crystalize and refine their own ideas.

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.662
One researcher I worked with

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:46.438
who works on the molecular mechanisms

00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:48.222
of neurodegenerative diseases

00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:50.200
came up with experiments that were related

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.183
directly to the animation that
she and I worked on together,

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:57.304
and in this way, animation can
feed back into the research process.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:00.157
I believe that animation can change biology.

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.725
It can change the way that we
communicate with one another,

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.348
how we explore our data

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:05.675
and how we teach our students.

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:07.129
But for that change to happen,

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.286
we need more researchers creating animations,

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:12.541
and toward that end, I brought together a team

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.678
of biologists, animators and programmers

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:18.725
to create a new, free, open-source software —

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.629
we call it Molecular Flipbook —

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.525
that's created just for biologists

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:26.070
just to create molecular animations.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.782
From our testing, we've found
that it only takes 15 minutes

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:33.050
for a biologist who has never
touched animation software before

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.786
to create her first molecular animation

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:37.308
of her own hypothesis.

00:04:37.308 --> 00:04:39.458
We're also building an online database

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:42.233
where anyone can view, download and contribute

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:43.849
their own animations.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.820
We're really excited to announce

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.282
that the beta version of the molecular animation

00:04:48.282 --> 00:04:52.490
software toolkit will be available for download today.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.233
We are really excited to see
what biologists will create with it

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.289
and what new insights they're able to gain

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.770
from finally being able to animate

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.473
their own model figures.

00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:02.713
Thank you.

00:05:02.713 --> 00:05:05.871
(Applause)
