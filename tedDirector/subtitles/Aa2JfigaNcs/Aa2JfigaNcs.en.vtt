00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
I study how the brain processes

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
information. That is, how it takes

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
information in from the outside world, and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
converts it into patterns of electrical activity,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and then how it uses those patterns

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
to allow you to do things --

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
to see, hear, to reach for an object.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
So I'm really a basic scientist, not

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
a clinician, but in the last year and a half

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I've started to switch over, to use what

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
we've been learning about these patterns

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
of activity to develop prosthetic devices,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
and what I wanted to do today is show you

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
an example of this.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
It's really our first foray into this.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
It's the development of a prosthetic device

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
for treating blindness.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
So let me start in on that problem.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
There are 10 million people in the U.S.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
and many more worldwide who are blind

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
or are facing blindness due to diseases

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
of the retina, diseases like

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
macular degeneration, and there's little

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
that can be done for them.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
There are some drug treatments, but

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
they're only effective on a small fraction

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
of the population. And so, for the vast

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
majority of patients, their best hope for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
The problem is that current prosthetics

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
don't work very well. They're still very

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
limited in the vision that they can provide.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And so, you know, for example, with these

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
devices, patients can see simple things

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
like bright lights and high contrast edges,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
not very much more, so nothing close

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
to normal vision has been possible.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
So what I'm going to tell you about today

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
is a device that we've been working on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
that I think has the potential to make

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
a difference, to be much more effective,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
and what I wanted to do is show you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
how it works. Okay, so let me back up a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
little bit and show you how a normal retina

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
works first so you can see the problem

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
that we were trying to solve.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
Here you have a retina.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
So when you look at something, like this image

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
of this baby's face, it goes into your eye

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
and it lands on your retina, on the front-end

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
cells here, the photoreceptors.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
the middle part, goes to work on it,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
and what it does is it performs operations

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
on it, it extracts information from it, and it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
converts that information into a code.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
And the code is in the form of these patterns

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
of electrical pulses that get sent

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
up to the brain, and so the key thing is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
that the image ultimately gets converted

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
into a code. And when I say code,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
I do literally mean code.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,"

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
and so when the brain gets this pattern

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
of pulses, it knows that what was out there

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
was a baby's face, and if it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
got a different pattern it would know

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
that what was out there was, say, a dog,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
or another pattern would be a house.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
meaning that it's changing all the time,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
so the patterns of pulses are changing

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
all the time because the world you're

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
looking at is changing all the time too.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
So, you know, it's sort of a complicated

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
thing. You have these patterns of pulses

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
coming out of your eye every millisecond

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
So what happens when a person

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
gets a retinal degenerative disease like

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
macular degeneration? What happens is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
is that, the front-end cells die,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
the photoreceptors die, and over time,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
all the cells and the circuits that are

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
connected to them, they die too.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Until the only things that you have left

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
are these cells here, the output cells,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
the ones that send the signals to the brain,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
but because of all that degeneration

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
they aren't sending any signals anymore.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
They aren't getting any input, so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
the person's brain no longer gets

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
any visual information --

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
that is, he or she is blind.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
So, a solution to the problem, then,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
would be to build a device that could mimic

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
the actions of that front-end circuitry

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
and send signals to the retina's output cells,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and they can go back to doing their

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
normal job of sending signals to the brain.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
So this is what we've been working on,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
and this is what our prosthetic does.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
So it consists of two parts, what we call

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
an encoder and a transducer.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
And so the encoder does just

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
what I was saying: it mimics the actions

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
in and converts them into the retina's code.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And then the transducer then makes the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
output cells send the code on up

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
to the brain, and the result is

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
a retinal prosthetic that can produce

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
normal retinal output.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
So a completely blind retina,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
even one with no front-end circuitry at all,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
no photoreceptors,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
can now send out normal signals,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
signals that the brain can understand.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
So no other device has been able

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
to do this.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Okay, so I just want to take

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
a sentence or two to say something about

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
the encoder and what it's doing, because

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
it's really the key part and it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
sort of interesting and kind of cool.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
I'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
you know what I mean.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
So what it's doing is, it's replacing

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
the retinal circuitry, really the guts of

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
a set of equations that we can implement

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
on a chip. So it's just math.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
In other words, we're not literally replacing

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
the components of the retina.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
It's not like we're making a little mini-device

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
for each of the different cell types.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
We've just abstracted what the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
retina's doing with a set of equations.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
And so, in a way, the equations are serving

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
as sort of a codebook. An image comes in,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
goes through the set of equations,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and out comes streams of electrical pulses,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.330
just like a normal retina would produce.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
Now let me put my money

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
where my mouth is and show you that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
we can actually produce normal output,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
and what the implications of this are.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Here are three sets of

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
firing patterns. The top one is from

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
a normal animal, the middle one is from

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
a blind animal that's been treated with

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
this encoder-transducer device, and the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
bottom one is from a blind animal treated

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
with a standard prosthetic.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
device that's out there right now, which is

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
basically made up of light detectors,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
but no encoder. So what we did was we

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
presented movies of everyday things --

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
people, babies, park benches,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
you know, regular things happening -- and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
we recorded the responses from the retinas

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
of these three groups of animals.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Now just to orient you, each box is showing

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
the firing patterns of several cells,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
and just as in the previous slides,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
each row is a different cell,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
and thinner so I could show you

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
a long stretch of data.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
So as you can see, the firing patterns

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
from the blind animal treated with

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
the encoder-transducer really do very

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
closely match the normal firing patterns --

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good --

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
and the blind animal treated with

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
the standard prosthetic,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
the responses really don't.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
And so with the standard method,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
the cells do fire, they just don't fire

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
in the normal firing patterns because

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
they don't have the right code.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
How important is this?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
What's the potential impact

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
on a patient's ability to see?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
So I'm just going to show you one

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
bottom-line experiment that answers this,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
and of course I've got a lot of other data,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
so if you're interested I'm happy

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
to show more. So the experiment

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
is called a reconstruction experiment.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
So what we did is we took a moment

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
in time from these recordings and asked,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
what was the retina seeing at that moment?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Can we reconstruct what the retina

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
was seeing from the responses

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
from the firing patterns?

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
So, when we did this for responses

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
from the standard method and from

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
our encoder and transducer.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
So let me show you, and I'm going to

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
start with the standard method first.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
So you can see that it's pretty limited,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
and because the firing patterns aren't

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
in the right code, they're very limited in

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
what they can tell you about

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
what's out there. So you can see that

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
there's something there, but it's not so clear

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
what that something is, and this just sort of

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
circles back to what I was saying in the

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
beginning, that with the standard method,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
patients can see high-contrast edges, they

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
can see light, but it doesn't easily go

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
further than that. So what was

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
the image? It was a baby's face.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
So what about with our approach,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
adding the code? And you can see

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
that it's much better. Not only can you

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
tell that it's a baby's face, but you can

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
tell that it's this baby's face, which is a

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
really challenging task.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
So on the left is the encoder

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
alone, and on the right is from an actual

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
But the key one really is the encoder alone,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
because we can team up the encoder with

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
the different transducer.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
This is just actually the first one that we tried.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
I just wanted to say something about the standard method.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
When this first came out, it was just a really

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
exciting thing, the idea that you

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
even make a blind retina respond at all.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
But there was this limiting factor,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
the issue of the code, and how to make

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
the cells respond better,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
produce normal responses,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
and so this was our contribution.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
Now I just want to wrap up,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
and as I was mentioning earlier

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
of course I have a lot of other data

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
if you're interested, but I just wanted to give

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
this sort of basic idea

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
of being able to communicate

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
with the brain in its language, and

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
the potential power of being able to do that.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
So it's different from the motor prosthetics

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
where you're communicating from the brain

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
to a device. Here we have to communicate

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
from the outside world

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
into the brain and be understood,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
and be understood by the brain.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
And then the last thing I wanted

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
to say, really, is to emphasize

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
that the idea generalizes.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So the same strategy that we used

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
to find the code for the retina we can also

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
use to find the code for other areas,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
for example, the auditory system and

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
the motor system, so for treating deafness

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
and for motor disorders.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
So just the same way that we were able to

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
jump over the damaged

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
output cells, we can jump over the

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
damaged circuitry in the cochlea

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
to get the auditory nerve,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
or jump over damaged areas in the cortex,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
produced by a stroke.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
I just want to end with a simple

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
message that understanding the code

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
is really, really important, and if we

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
can understand the code,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
the language of the brain, things become

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
possible that didn't seem obviously

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
possible before. Thank you.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.330
(Applause)
