00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.607
At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:24.515
dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:28.725
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.922
by regular janitors,

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:36.094
but I never have the decency to honor their names.

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:39.262
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths

00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:41.813
when teenage girls wear clothes that covers

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:46.652
their insecurities but exposes everything else.

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:50.470
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.312
camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:55.671
but need hugs.

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:58.939
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.605
Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.874
but never learn to swim,

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:07.016
part like the Red Sea when the bell rings.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:09.794
This is a training ground.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:12.101
My high school is Chicago,

00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:15.362
diverse and segregated on purpose.

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:18.875
Social lines are barbed wire.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:24.131
Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.

00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:28.515
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.883
who are soldiers in territory that owns them.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.537
This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:37.795
from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:41.581
built to recycle the trash of this system.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.575
Trained at a young age to capitalize,

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:47.579
letters taught now that capitalism raises you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.428
but you have to step on someone else to get there.

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:53.621
This is a training ground where one group

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:56.528
is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:59.163
No wonder so many of my people spit bars,

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:02.027
because the truth is hard to swallow.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:06.296
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.

00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:08.436
Homework is stressful,

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:11.036
but when you go home every day and your home is work,

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.013
you don't want to pick up any assignments.

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:14.987
Reading textbooks is stressful,

00:02:14.987 --> 00:02:17.243
but reading does not matter when you feel

00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:19.299
your story is already written,

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.375
either dead or getting booked.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.200
Taking tests is stressful,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.788
but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:28.979
bullets from bursting.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.564
I hear education systems are failing,

00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:36.106
but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.244
to train you, to keep you on track,

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:41.550
to track down an American dream that has failed

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.484
so many of us all.

00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:52.770
(Applause)
