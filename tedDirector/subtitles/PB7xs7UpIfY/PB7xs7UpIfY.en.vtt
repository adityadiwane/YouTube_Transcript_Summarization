00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.271
I have a question:

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:17.648
Who here remembers when they first realized

00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:21.071
they were going to die?

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.573
I do. I was a young boy,

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:26.628
and my grandfather had just died,

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:30.546
and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:34.180
trying to make sense of what had happened.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.815
What did it mean that he was dead?

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.599
Where had he gone?

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:42.021
It was like a hole in reality had opened up

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.156
and swallowed him.

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.958
But then the really shocking
question occurred to me:

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.448
If he could die, could it happen to me too?

00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:53.747
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.537
Would it open up beneath my bed

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:58.771
and swallow me as I slept?

00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.959
Well, at some point, all children
become aware of death.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.864
It can happen in different ways, of course,

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.697
and usually comes in stages.

00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:10.210
Our idea of death develops as we grow older.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.939
And if you reach back into the dark corners

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.636
of your memory,

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.639
you might remember something like what I felt

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.894
when my grandfather died and when I realized

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:22.844
it could happen to me too,

00:01:22.844 --> 00:01:25.423
that sense that behind all of this

00:01:25.423 --> 00:01:28.760
the void is waiting.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.037
And this development in childhood

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:33.858
reflects the development of our species.

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:37.173
Just as there was a point in your development

00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:40.699
as a child when your sense of self and of time

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:42.798
became sophisticated enough

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:46.720
for you to realize you were mortal,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.426
so at some point in the evolution of our species,

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.441
some early human's sense of self and of time

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:55.684
became sophisticated enough

00:01:55.684 --> 00:01:58.799
for them to become the first human to realize,

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.232
"I'm going to die."

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:04.451
This is, if you like, our curse.

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:08.494
It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.593
We have to live in the knowledge

00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:13.254
that the worst thing that can possibly happen

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:14.878
one day surely will,

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:16.384
the end of all our projects,

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:19.848
our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:23.029
We each live in the shadow of a personal

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.018
apocalypse.

00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:27.522
And that's frightening. It's terrifying.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.982
And so we look for a way out.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.263
And in my case, as I was about five years old,

00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:36.258
this meant asking my mum.

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.720
Now when I first started asking

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.501
what happens when we die,

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.593
the grown-ups around me at the time

00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:45.796
answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:48.783
and half-hearted Christianity,

00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:50.727
and the phrase I heard most often

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:52.286
was that granddad was now

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:54.750
"up there looking down on us,"

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.715
and if I should die too, which
wouldn't happen of course,

00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.511
then I too would go up there,

00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:02.561
which made death sound a lot like

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.215
an existential elevator.

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:08.333
Now this didn't sound very plausible.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.236
I used to watch a children's
news program at the time,

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:13.676
and this was the era of space exploration.

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:15.850
There were always rockets going up into the sky,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.546
up into space, going up there.

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:20.875
But none of the astronauts when they came back

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:24.107
ever mentioned having met my granddad

00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:26.566
or any other dead people.

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:27.869
But I was scared,

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.309
and the idea of taking the existential elevator

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.915
to see my granddad

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.330
sounded a lot better than being swallowed

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.401
by the void while I slept.

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.670
And so I believed it anyway,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.341
even though it didn't make much sense.

00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:43.583
And this thought process that I went through

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:46.114
as a child, and have been through many times since,

00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:48.024
including as a grown-up,

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:50.471
is a product of what psychologists call

00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.935
a bias.

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.209
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.927
get things wrong,

00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:59.611
ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:03.200
distort reality, or see what we want to see,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.432
and the bias I'm talking about

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:06.870
works like this:

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.105
Confront someone with the fact

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:10.652
that they are going to die

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:13.685
and they will believe just about any story

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:15.543
that tells them it isn't true

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:17.957
and they can, instead, live forever,

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:22.042
even if it means taking the existential elevator.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:26.470
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.345
It has been demonstrated in over 400

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:31.026
empirical studies.

00:04:31.026 --> 00:04:33.535
Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:35.470
They work like this.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.960
You take two groups of people

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.743
who are similar in all relevant respects,

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:42.432
and you remind one group that they're going to die

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.061
but not the other, then you compare their behavior.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:48.934
So you're observing how it biases behavior

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.688
when people become aware of their mortality.

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:55.600
And every time, you get the same result:

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.687
People who are made aware of their mortality

00:04:58.687 --> 00:05:00.698
are more willing to believe stories

00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:02.561
that tell them they can escape death

00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.333
and live forever.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:06.622
So here's an example: One recent study

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:09.392
took two groups of agnostics,

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.988
that is people who are undecided

00:05:10.988 --> 00:05:13.503
in their religious beliefs.

00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:17.087
Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.732
The other group was asked to think about

00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:20.565
being lonely.

00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:23.381
They were then asked again
about their religious beliefs.

00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:26.245
Those who had been asked
to think about being dead

00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:29.818
were afterwards twice as likely to express faith

00:05:29.818 --> 00:05:31.478
in God and Jesus.

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:33.256
Twice as likely.

00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:35.964
Even though the before they
were all equally agnostic.

00:05:35.964 --> 00:05:37.725
But put the fear of death in them,

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:41.584
and they run to Jesus.

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:45.096
Now, this shows that reminding people of death

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:48.341
biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,

00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:50.366
and it works not just for religion,

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.603
but for any kind of belief system

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:56.063
that promises immortality in some form,

00:05:56.063 --> 00:05:57.868
whether it's becoming famous

00:05:57.868 --> 00:05:59.282
or having children

00:05:59.282 --> 00:06:00.629
or even nationalism,

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.902
which promises you can live
on as part of a greater whole.

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:05.833
This is a bias that has shaped

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:09.172
the course of human history.

00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:11.439
Now, the theory behind this bias

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.176
in the over 400 studies

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.305
is called terror management theory,

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:17.655
and the idea is simple. It's just this.

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:20.204
We develop our worldviews,

00:06:20.204 --> 00:06:22.361
that is, the stories we tell ourselves

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:25.097
about the world and our place in it,

00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:27.379
in order to help us manage

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.293
the terror of death.

00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:32.092
And these immortality stories

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:35.089
have thousands of different manifestations,

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:38.673
but I believe that behind the apparent diversity

00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:41.372
there are actually just four basic forms

00:06:41.372 --> 00:06:44.883
that these immortality stories can take.

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.688
And we can see them repeating themselves

00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:49.858
throughout history, just with slight variations

00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:52.623
to reflect the vocabulary of the day.

00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:55.131
Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.384
basic forms of immortality story,

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:58.954
and I want to try to give you some sense

00:06:58.954 --> 00:07:01.267
of the way in which they're retold by each culture

00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:03.034
or generation

00:07:03.034 --> 00:07:05.206
using the vocabulary of their day.

00:07:05.206 --> 00:07:07.845
Now, the first story is the simplest.

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.998
We want to avoid death,

00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:12.423
and the dream of doing that in this body

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:13.783
in this world forever

00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:17.074
is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:19.533
and it might at first sound implausible,

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:23.514
but actually, almost every culture in human history

00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:25.576
has had some myth or legend

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:28.337
of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth

00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:31.316
or something that promises to keep us going

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:34.453
forever.

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:36.046
Ancient Egypt had such myths,

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:38.414
ancient Babylon, ancient India.

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:41.266
Throughout European history, we find them
in the work of the alchemists,

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:44.060
and of course we still believe this today,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.623
only we tell this story using the vocabulary

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:48.279
of science.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.885
So 100 years ago,

00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:51.704
hormones had just been discovered,

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:53.356
and people hoped that hormone treatments

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:56.055
were going to cure aging and disease,

00:07:56.055 --> 00:07:58.908
and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,

00:07:58.908 --> 00:08:01.203
genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:05.161
But the idea that science can cure death

00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:07.502
is just one more chapter in the story

00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:09.735
of the magical elixir,

00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:14.171
a story that is as old as civilization.

00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:16.951
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir

00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:18.354
and staying alive forever

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:20.155
is a risky strategy.

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:22.395
When we look back through history

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:25.179
at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,

00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:27.008
the one thing they now have in common

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:29.638
is that they're all dead.

00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:33.376
So we need a backup plan,
and exactly this kind of plan B

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:36.947
is what the second kind of immortality story offers,

00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:38.702
and that's resurrection.

00:08:38.702 --> 00:08:41.076
And it stays with the idea that I am this body,

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:43.051
I am this physical organism.

00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:45.219
It accepts that I'm going to have to die

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:46.593
but says, despite that,

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:49.096
I can rise up and I can live again.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:51.714
In other words, I can do what Jesus did.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:53.759
Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:56.870
and then he rose up and lived again.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.989
And the idea that we can all be
resurrected to live again

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:02.277
is orthodox believe, not just for Christians

00:09:02.277 --> 00:09:04.980
but also Jews and Muslims.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.144
But our desire to believe this story

00:09:07.144 --> 00:09:09.154
is so deeply embedded

00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:11.252
that we are reinventing it again

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:12.744
for the scientific age,

00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:15.567
for example, with the idea of cryonics.

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.157
That's the idea that when you die,

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.156
you can have yourself frozen,

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:21.545
and then, at some point when technology

00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:22.756
has advanced enough,

00:09:22.756 --> 00:09:24.876
you can be thawed out and repaired and revived

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:26.165
and so resurrected.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:29.013
And so some people believe an omnipotent god

00:09:29.013 --> 00:09:30.892
will resurrect them to live again,

00:09:30.892 --> 00:09:35.035
and other people believe an 
omnipotent scientist will do it.

00:09:35.035 --> 00:09:37.749
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,

00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:39.752
of climbing out of the grave,

00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:42.471
it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.

00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:45.262
They find the body too messy, too unreliable

00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:47.410
to guarantee eternal life,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.501
and so they set their hopes on the third,

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:52.618
more spiritual immortality story,

00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:54.954
the idea that we can leave our body behind

00:09:54.954 --> 00:09:57.251
and live on as a soul.

00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:59.240
Now, the majority of people on Earth

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.013
believe they have a soul,

00:10:01.013 --> 00:10:03.423
and the idea is central to many religions.

00:10:03.423 --> 00:10:05.737
But even though, in its current form,

00:10:05.737 --> 00:10:07.652
in its traditional form,

00:10:07.652 --> 00:10:09.815
the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,

00:10:09.815 --> 00:10:11.247
nonetheless we are again

00:10:11.247 --> 00:10:13.471
reinventing it for the digital age,

00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:14.948
for example with the idea

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.938
that you can leave your body behind

00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:19.184
by uploading your mind, your essence,

00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:21.140
the real you, onto a computer,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.752
and so live on as an avatar in the ether.

00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:27.775
But of course there are skeptics who say

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.619
if we look at the evidence of science,

00:10:29.619 --> 00:10:31.263
particularly neuroscience,

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.092
it suggests that your mind,

00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:34.672
your essence, the real you,

00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:37.085
is very much dependent on a particular part

00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:39.306
of your body, that is, your brain.

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.827
And such skeptics can find comfort

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.085
in the fourth kind of immortality story,

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:46.442
and that is legacy,

00:10:46.442 --> 00:10:47.922
the idea that you can live on

00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:50.173
through the echo you leave in the world,

00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:52.522
like the great Greek warrior Achilles,

00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:55.151
who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy

00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:58.204
so that he might win immortal fame.

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:00.470
And the pursuit of fame is as widespread

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.611
and popular now as it ever was,

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:04.190
and in our digital age,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.718
it's even easier to achieve.

00:11:05.718 --> 00:11:08.042
You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.735
or a great king or hero.

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:14.558
All you need is an Internet connection
and a funny cat. (Laughter)

00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:17.021
But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,

00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:19.865
biological legacy -- children, for example.

00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:22.141
Or they like, they hope, to live on

00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:23.858
as part of some greater whole,

00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:26.307
a nation or a family or a tribe,

00:11:26.307 --> 00:11:28.773
their gene pool.

00:11:28.773 --> 00:11:30.286
But again, there are skeptics

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.999
who doubt whether legacy

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:33.974
really is immortality.

00:11:33.974 --> 00:11:36.051
Woody Allen, for example, who said,

00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:38.547
"I don't want to live on in
the hearts of my countrymen.

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:40.744
I want to live on in my apartment."

00:11:40.744 --> 00:11:42.511
So those are the four

00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:44.694
basic kinds of immortality stories,

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:46.336
and I've tried to give just some sense

00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:48.629
of how they're retold by each generation

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:50.216
with just slight variations

00:11:50.216 --> 00:11:52.521
to fit the fashions of the day.

00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:56.010
And the fact that they recur in this way,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.998
in such a similar form but
in such different belief systems,

00:11:58.998 --> 00:12:00.576
suggests, I think,

00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:02.978
that we should be skeptical of the truth

00:12:02.978 --> 00:12:06.739
of any particular version of these stories.

00:12:06.739 --> 00:12:08.850
The fact that some people believe

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.515
an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again

00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:15.216
and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it

00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:18.254
suggests that neither are really believing this

00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:20.924
on the strength of the evidence.

00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:23.350
Rather, we believe these stories

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.333
because we are biased to believe them,

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:27.161
and we are biased to believe them

00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:31.431
because we are so afraid of death.

00:12:31.431 --> 00:12:33.486
So the question is,

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:36.958
are we doomed to lead the one life we have

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.651
in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,

00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:43.726
or can we overcome this bias?

00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:46.193
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus

00:12:46.193 --> 00:12:47.921
thought we could.

00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:51.469
He argued that the fear of death is natural,

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:53.884
but it is not rational.

00:12:53.884 --> 00:12:56.542
"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:59.392
because when we are here, death is not,

00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:03.145
and when death is here, we are gone."

00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:04.943
Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult

00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:07.265
to really grasp, to really internalize,

00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:09.428
because exactly this idea of being gone

00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:11.567
is so difficult to imagine.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.798
So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,

00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:17.255
Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.199
"Death is not an event in life:

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.841
We do not live to experience death.

00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.035
And so," he added,

00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:27.970
"in this sense, life has no end."

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.146
So it was natural for me as a child

00:13:31.146 --> 00:13:33.513
to fear being swallowed by the void,

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:35.392
but it wasn't rational,

00:13:35.392 --> 00:13:37.377
because being swallowed by the void

00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:39.455
is not something that any of us

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:42.725
will ever live to experience.

00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:45.254
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because

00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:48.213
the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,

00:13:48.213 --> 00:13:52.695
yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,

00:13:52.695 --> 00:13:54.825
and when we bring out into the open

00:13:54.825 --> 00:13:57.523
the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,

00:13:57.523 --> 00:13:59.374
then we can at least start

00:13:59.374 --> 00:14:02.008
to try to minimize the influence it has

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.891
on our lives.

00:14:03.891 --> 00:14:06.709
Now, I find it helps to see life

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:08.553
as being like a book:

00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:11.021
Just as a book is bounded by its covers,

00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:12.298
by beginning and end,

00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:16.036
so our lives are bounded by birth and death,

00:14:16.036 --> 00:14:19.551
and even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.687
it can encompass distant landscapes,

00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:24.917
exotic figures, fantastic adventures.

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:28.266
And even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:30.089
the characters within it

00:14:30.089 --> 00:14:32.931
know no horizons.

00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:36.088
They only know the moments
that make up their story,

00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:39.028
even when the book is closed.

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:41.164
And so the characters of a book

00:14:41.164 --> 00:14:44.646
are not afraid of reaching the last page.

00:14:44.646 --> 00:14:46.924
Long John Silver is not afraid of you

00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:49.759
finishing your copy of "Treasure Island."

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:51.459
And so it should be with us.

00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:53.603
Imagine the book of your life,

00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:56.387
its covers, its beginning and end,
and your birth and your death.

00:14:56.387 --> 00:14:58.564
You can only know the moments in between,

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.499
the moments that make up your life.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.446
It makes no sense for you to fear

00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:04.536
what is outside of those covers,

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.006
whether before your birth

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.982
or after your death.

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:10.511
And you needn't worry how long the book is,

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:13.984
or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.

00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:15.526
The only thing that matters

00:15:15.526 --> 00:15:19.024
is that you make it a good story.

00:15:19.024 --> 00:15:21.244
Thank you.

00:15:21.244 --> 00:15:25.429
(Applause)
