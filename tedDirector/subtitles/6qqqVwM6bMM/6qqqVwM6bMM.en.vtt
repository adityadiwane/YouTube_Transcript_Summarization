00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'd like to take you to another world.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And I'd like to share

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
a 45 year-old love story

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
with the poor,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
living on less than one dollar a day.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I went to a very elitist, snobbish,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
expensive education in India,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and that almost destroyed me.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I was all set

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
all laid out.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
for three years.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
(Laughter)

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
The whole world was laid out for me.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Everything was at my feet.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I could do nothing wrong.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And then I thought out of curiosity

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I'd like to go and live and work

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and just see what a village is like.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So in 1965,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and I saw starvation, death,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
people dying of hunger, for the first time.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
It changed my life.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I came back home,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
told my mother,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
"I'd like to live and work in a village."

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Mother went into a coma.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
(Laughter)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
"What is this?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and you want to go and work in a village?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
It made me think.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And I wanted to give something back

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
in my own way."

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
"What do you want to do in a village?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
No job, no money,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
no security, no prospect."

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I said, "I want to live

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and dig wells for five years."

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
"Dig wells for five years?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
You went to the most expensive school and college in India,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and you want to dig wells for five years?"

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
She didn't speak to me for a very long time,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
because she thought I'd let my family down.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But then,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that very poor people have,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
which are never brought into the mainstream --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
which is never identified, respected,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
applied on a large scale.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
college only for the poor.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
What the poor thought was important

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
would be reflected in the college.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I went to this village for the first time.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Elders came to me

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and said, "Are you running from the police?"

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I said, "No."

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
(Laughter)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
"You failed in your exam?"

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I said, "No."

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
"What are you doing here?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Why are you here?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
The education system in India

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
what are you doing in this village?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I said, "No, I want to actually start a college

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
only for the poor.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
They said, "Please,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
into your college."

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
So it's the only college in India

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
you are disqualified to come.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to come to our college.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
You have to work with your hands.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
You have to have a dignity of labor.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and provide a service to the community.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So we started the Barefoot College,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and we redefined professionalism.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Who is a professional?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
A professional is someone

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
who has a combination of competence,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
confidence and belief.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
A water diviner is a professional.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
A traditional midwife

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is a professional.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
A traditional bone setter is a professional.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
These are professionals all over the world.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and show that the knowledge and skills that they have

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is universal.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
It needs to be used, needs to be applied,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
needs to be shown to the world outside --

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that these knowledge and skills

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
are relevant even today.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
So the college works

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
There are no contracts, no written contracts.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And no one can get more than $100 a month.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
You come for the work and the challenge,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
you'll come to the Barefoot College.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It doesn't matter if you fail.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Battered, bruised, you start again.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and the learner is the teacher.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
You are certified by the community you serve.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
to show that you are an engineer.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So when I said that,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.260
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
So we built the first Barefoot College

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
in 1986.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
who can't read and write,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
built on $1.50 a sq. ft.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.260
150 people lived there, worked there.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.260
but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
because they didn't believe us,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I asked a forester --

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
high-powered, paper-qualified expert --

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
I said, "What can you build in this place?"

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Not even worth it.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
No water, rocky soil."

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I was in a bit of a spot.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
He looked quietly at me and said,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
This is what it looks like today.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Went to the roof,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and all the women said, "Clear out.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
This is waterproofing the roof."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and a bit of other things I don't know.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
But it actually doesn't leak.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
This technology, the women will not share with the men.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
(Laughter)

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
It's the only college

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
which is fully solar-electrified.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
All the power comes from the sun.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
So long as the sun shines,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
we'll have no problem with power.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
But the beauty is

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that is was installed

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
by a priest, a Hindu priest,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
who's only done eight years of primary schooling --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
never been to school, never been to college.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
He knows more about solar

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
is solar cooked.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
are women,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
illiterate women,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
who actually fabricate

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
the most sophisticated solar cooker.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Unfortunately, they're almost half German,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
they're so precise.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
(Laughter)

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
You'll never find Indian women so precise.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Absolutely to the last inch,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
they can make that cooker.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And we have 60 meals twice a day

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of solar cooking.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
We have a dentist --

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
She actually looks after the teeth

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
of 7,000 children.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Barefoot technology:

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Very little water is wasted.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
All the roofs are connected underground

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to a 400,000 liter tank,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and no water is wasted.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
because we collect rainwater.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
60 percent of children don't go to school,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
because they have to look after animals --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
sheep, goats --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
domestic chores.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
So we thought of starting a school

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
at night for the children.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Because the night schools of Tilonia,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Because it's for the convenience of the child;

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
it's not for the convenience of the teacher.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And what do we teach in these schools?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Democracy, citizenship,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
how you should measure your land,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
what you should do if you're arrested,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.260
what you should do if your animal is sick.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
This is what we teach in the night schools.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
But all the schools are solar-lit.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Every five years

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
we have an election.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Between six to 14 year-old children

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
participate in a democratic process,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and they elect a prime minister.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
The prime minister is 12 years old.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
She looks after 20 goats in the morning,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
but she's prime minister in the evening.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
She has a cabinet,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And they actually monitor and supervise

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
150 schools for 7,000 children.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and she went to Sweden.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
First time ever going out of her village.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Never seen Sweden.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
She's only 12 years old,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and she's not dazzled by anything."

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And the girl, who's on her left,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
(Laughter)

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:29.260
(Applause)

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
we use puppetry.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Puppets is the way we communicate.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
You have Jokhim Chacha

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.260
who is 300 years old.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
He's my donor.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
He actually raises money,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
solves my disputes.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
He solves my problems in the village.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
If there's tension in the village,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
if attendance at the schools goes down

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and says, "Shake hands.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
The attendance must not drop."

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
These puppets

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
are made out of recycled World Bank reports.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
(Laughter)

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Applause)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.260
So this decentralized, demystified approach

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
of solar-electrifying villages,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
we've covered all over India

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
from Ladakh up to Bhutan --

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
all solar-electrified villages

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
by people who have been trained.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And we went to Ladakh,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and we asked this woman --

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and we asked this woman,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
"What was the benefit you had

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
from solar electricity?"

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And she thought for a minute and said,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.260
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
(Laughter)

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Went to Afghanistan.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.260
One lesson we learned in India

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.260
was men are untrainable.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.260
(Laughter)

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Men are restless,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
men are ambitious,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
men are compulsively mobile,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and they all want a certificate.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
(Laughter)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
All across the globe, you have this tendency

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
of men wanting a certificate.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Why? Because they want to leave the village

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and go to a city, looking for a job.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
So we came up with a great solution:

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
train grandmothers.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
What's the best way of communicating

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
in the world today?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
Television? No.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Telegraph? No.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Telephone? No.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
Tell a woman.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
(Laughter)

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.260
(Applause)

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and we picked three women

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and said, "We want to take them to India."

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
and you want to take them to India."

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So I took the husbands along.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
In six months,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
how do we train these women?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
Sign language.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
You don't choose the written word.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
You don't choose the spoken word.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
You use sign language.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And in six months

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.260
they can become solar engineers.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
This woman went back

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and solar-electrified the first village,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
set up a workshop --

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
[was] by the three women.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
This woman

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
is an extraordinary grandmother.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.260
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And they haven't collapsed.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
and told the head of the department

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
the difference between AC and DC.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
He didn't know.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Those three women have trained 27 more women

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
We went to Africa,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and we did the same thing.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
because they're all speaking a different language.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
But their body language is great.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
They're speaking to each other

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and actually becoming solar engineers.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
I went to Sierra Leone,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
comes across this village.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
They said, "These two grandmothers ... "

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
Went straight to the president.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
"What's the story."

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
But they will. The grandmothers will."

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.260
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Gambia:

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Went to this village.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
I knew which woman I would like to take.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
The community got together and said, "Take these two women."

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
"Difficult husband; not possible."

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Called the husband, the husband came,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
That was his biggest fear.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
She went like a grandmother

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and came back like a tiger.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
She walked out of the plane

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
She handled the national press,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
and she was a star.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
(Laughter)

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
Success story.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
(Laughter)

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
(Applause)

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.260
I'll just wind up by saying

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.260
that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Look for solutions within.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
They're all over the world.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
Don't even worry.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
They have all the solutions in the world.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
"First they ignore you,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
then they laugh at you,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
then they fight you,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
and then you win."

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
Thank you.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:19:01.260
(Applause)
