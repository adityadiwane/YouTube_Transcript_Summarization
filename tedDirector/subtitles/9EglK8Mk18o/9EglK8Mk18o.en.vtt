00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:16.598
So I'll be talking about the success of my campus,

00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:19.348
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.539
in educating students of all types,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.666
across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.744
What makes our story especially important

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:35.952
is that we have learned so much from a group of students

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.299
who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder --

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.297
students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:46.148
And what makes the story especially unique

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:50.982
is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:52.786
students from low-income backgrounds,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.244
to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:59.714
And so I begin with a story about my childhood.

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.786
We all are products of our childhood experiences.

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:06.964
It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:12.870
since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.037
a kid who loved getting A's,

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:17.724
a kid who loved math, who loved to read,

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:20.453
a kid who would say to the teacher --

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:23.709
when the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class,

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.790
this little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more."

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.102
And the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman."

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:34.716
And there was a designated kicker every day.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.597
And so I was always asking this question:

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:42.554
"Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:45.672
And amazingly, one week in church,

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.754
when I really didn't want to be there

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:52.855
and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:55.291
I heard this man say this:

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.773
"If we can get the children

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:03.770
to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.171
we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:13.904
and that children really do want to get the best possible education."

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:15.625
And I looked up and said, "Who is that man?"

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:18.754
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:20.685
And I said to my parents, "I've got to go.

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.254
I want to go. I want to be a part of this."

00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:24.124
And they said, "Absolutely not."

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:25.337
(Laughter)

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.255
And we had a rough go of it.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:30.708
And at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:32.995
And somehow I said, "You know, you guys are hypocrites.

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.972
You make me go to this. You make me listen.

00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:37.206
The man wants me to go, and now you say no."

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.954
And they thought about it all night.

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:41.088
And they came into my room the next morning.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:42.588
They had not slept.

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:45.104
They had been literally crying and praying and thinking,

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:48.664
"Will we let our 12-year-old

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:52.816
participate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:54.505
And they decided to do it.

00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:55.887
And when they came in to tell me,

00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:57.672
I was at first elated.

00:02:57.672 --> 00:03:01.604
And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,

00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:04.486
and I got really scared, I really did.

00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:06.588
And one of the points I make to people all the time

00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:09.823
is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:12.172
it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.

00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:15.020
It simply means that they believe it's important to do it.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.771
I wanted a better education.

00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:20.004
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:22.487
I wanted to know that the school I attended

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:24.912
not only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:26.588
And as a result of that experience,

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:28.922
in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,

00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:31.472
Dr. King came and said with our parents,

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.437
"What you children do this day

00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:39.021
will have an impact on children who have not been born."

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:43.956
I recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:47.470
had not been born at the time of 1963.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.411
And so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.673
in many ways, if they see it on TV,

00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:56.087
it's like our looking at the 1863 "Lincoln" movie:

00:03:56.087 --> 00:03:57.521
It's history.

00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.494
And the real question is, what lessons did we learn?

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.386
Well amazingly, the most important for me was this:

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:08.686
That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:11.037
They can be taught to be passionate

00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:15.578
about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions.

00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:18.373
And so it is especially significant

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:20.459
that the university I now lead,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.254
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:29.040
was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.210
And what made that institutional founding especially important

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.744
is that Maryland is the South, as you know,

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:42.326
and, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:46.402
founded at a time when students of all races could go there.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.975
And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:54.160
And it has been for 50 years an experiment.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.860
The experiment is this:

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.819
Is it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.756
where people from all backgrounds can come and learn

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:06.339
and learn to work together and learn to become leaders

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.912
and to support each other in that experience?

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:14.827
Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this:

00:05:14.827 --> 00:05:19.495
We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:22.051
And so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.834
And we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:28.467
We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:30.004
A lot of our students get into theater.

00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:31.004
It's great work.

00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:35.036
The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face --

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:36.883
that students in the sciences and engineering,

00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:38.994
black students were not succeeding.

00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:40.745
But when I looked at the data,

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:44.077
what I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.700
large numbers were not making it.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.618
And as a result of that,

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:50.952
we decided to do something that would help, first of all,

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:55.169
the group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.500
And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help."

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.953
Robert Meyerhoff said, "Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:05.751
if it's not about basketball, is not positive?

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.383
I'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive."

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:12.050
We married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.119
And what is significant about the program

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.600
is that we learned a number of things.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.952
And the question is this:

00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:22.417
How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:27.267
who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:29.916
That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:32.151
That's a big deal. It really is.

00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.727
(Applause)

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.671
You see, most people don't realize

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:40.721
that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.

00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:44.338
Quite frankly, you're talking about Americans.

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:47.786
If you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:50.121
who begin with a major in science and engineering

00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:52.273
will actually graduate in science and engineering,

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:55.827
only 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas

00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:58.485
actually succeed and graduate in those areas,

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:00.590
and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.201
And so, the real question is, what is the challenge?

00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:05.588
Well a part of it, of course, is K-12.

00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:07.537
We need to strengthen K-12.

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.833
But the other part has to do with the culture

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.493
of science and engineering on our campuses.

00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:16.338
Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:17.803
and large numbers of A.P. credits

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.505
who go to the most prestigious universities in our country

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:25.336
begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:27.802
And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:30.752
is they did not do well in first year science courses.

00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:34.535
In fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,

00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:36.669
weed-out courses or barrier courses.

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.437
How many of you in this audience know somebody

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:40.252
who started off in pre-med or engineering

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:42.137
and changed their major within a year or two?

00:07:42.137 --> 00:07:43.935
It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:45.336
I know. I know. I know.

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:46.994
And what is interesting about that

00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:49.704
is that so many students are smart and can do it.

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.970
We need to find ways of making it happen.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.577
So what are the four things we did to help minority students

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.386
that now are helping students in general?

00:07:56.386 --> 00:07:58.253
Number one: high expectations.

00:07:58.253 --> 00:08:02.758
It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students --

00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:05.102
their grades, the rigor of the course work,

00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:07.553
their test-taking skills, their attitude,

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.278
the fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.

00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:14.519
And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:19.618
But equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.

00:08:19.618 --> 00:08:22.136
I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:24.503
Smart simply means you're ready to learn.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.745
You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions.

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:32.032
I. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,

00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:34.578
all of his friends' parents would ask them

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:37.220
"What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.757
And he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,

00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:43.819
"Izzy, did you ask a good question today?"

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:46.518
And so high expectations have to do with curiosity

00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:49.036
and encouraging young people to be curious.

00:08:49.036 --> 00:08:50.552
And as a result of those high expectations,

00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:53.219
we began to find students we wanted to work with

00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:54.912
to see what could we do to help them,

00:08:54.912 --> 00:08:57.452
not simply to survive in science and engineering,

00:08:57.452 --> 00:09:00.386
but to become the very best, to excel.

00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:02.203
Interestingly enough, an example:

00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:07.105
One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.220
we said, "We need to have you retake the course,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.004
because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level."

00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.035
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level.

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:17.176
He retook the course.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:19.605
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC,

00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:23.802
to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.

00:09:23.802 --> 00:09:25.008
He now works at Harvard.

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.455
Nice story. Give him a hand for that too.

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:29.885
(Applause)

00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.381
Secondly, it's not about test scores only.

00:09:32.381 --> 00:09:34.370
Test scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.415
One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:39.464
But she had a factor that was very important.

00:09:39.464 --> 00:09:42.712
She never missed a day of school, K-12.

00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:44.133
There was fire in that belly.

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:48.257
That young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.

00:09:48.257 --> 00:09:52.444
She's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:57.286
She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:59.771
Big hand for her. Big hand for her.

00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:01.157
(Applause)

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:03.677
And so high expectations, very important.

00:10:03.677 --> 00:10:06.536
Secondly, the idea of building community among the students.

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:09.303
You all know that so often in science and engineering

00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:10.994
we tend to think cutthroat.

00:10:10.994 --> 00:10:13.310
Students are not taught to work in groups.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.202
And that's what we work to do with that group

00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:16.705
to get them to understand each other,

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:19.328
to build trust among them, to support each other,

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.037
to learn how to ask good questions,

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.524
but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.787
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,

00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:28.912
it's another thing to help someone else do well.

00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:32.827
And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.

00:10:32.827 --> 00:10:35.774
So building community among those students, very important.

00:10:35.774 --> 00:10:40.578
Third, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.

00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:43.107
Whether you're talking about artists producing artists

00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:46.022
or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:50.869
whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example --

00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:53.672
you need scientists to pull the students into the work.

00:10:53.672 --> 00:10:56.412
And so our students are working in labs regularly.

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:58.786
And one great example that you'll appreciate:

00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:01.846
During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,

00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:05.466
the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:09.890
literally came back to work in his lab after several days,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.183
and all these students had refused to leave the lab.

00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:15.267
They had food they had packed out.

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:16.582
They were in the lab working,

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:20.583
and they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:22.495
They knew they were working on AIDS research.

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:25.703
They were looking at this amazing protein design.

00:11:25.703 --> 00:11:30.036
And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.

00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:32.202
And he said, "It doesn't get any better than that."

00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:34.287
And then finally, if you've got the community

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:37.900
and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.788
you have to have people who are willing as faculty

00:11:40.788 --> 00:11:43.851
to get involved with those students, even in the classroom.

00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:46.299
I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:48.744
"I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,

00:11:48.744 --> 00:11:51.784
and he seems like he's just not excited about the work.

00:11:51.784 --> 00:11:54.019
He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him."

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:57.891
What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student

00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.807
to understand who was really involved and who was not

00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.174
and was saying, "Let me see how I can work with them.

00:12:03.174 --> 00:12:04.411
Let me get the staff to help me out."

00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:05.563
It was that connecting.

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:10.495
That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.

00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:11.707
Give him a big hand for that.

00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:13.703
(Applause)

00:12:13.703 --> 00:12:18.523
And so the significance is that we have now developed this model

00:12:18.523 --> 00:12:22.688
that is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.

00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:26.120
And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.661
And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.

00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:32.322
But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.

00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:34.869
Because so many students are bored in class.

00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:36.049
Do you know that?

00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:37.995
Many students, K-12 and in universities,

00:12:37.995 --> 00:12:40.500
don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.870
They need to be engaged.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.320
And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.285
you'll see people coming from all over the country

00:12:47.285 --> 00:12:49.864
to look at how we are redesigning courses,

00:12:49.864 --> 00:12:53.355
having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:56.585
using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,

00:12:56.585 --> 00:12:58.615
and not giving students the theories,

00:12:58.615 --> 00:13:00.847
but having them struggle with those theories.

00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:04.506
And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,

00:13:04.506 --> 00:13:06.547
more and more courses are being redesigned.

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:08.381
It's called academic innovation.

00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:09.586
And what does all of that mean?

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:12.429
It means that now, not just in science and engineering,

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:16.537
we now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,

00:13:16.537 --> 00:13:21.129
in teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:25.216
If you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:29.334
in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:32.647
And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference

00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:35.202
will be building community among students,

00:13:35.202 --> 00:13:38.198
telling young women, young minority students and students in general,

00:13:38.198 --> 00:13:39.447
you can do this work.

00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:42.717
And most important, giving them a chance to build that community

00:13:42.717 --> 00:13:44.880
with faculty pulling them into the work

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.398
and our assessing what works and what does not work.

00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:51.246
Most important, if a student has a sense of self,

00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:54.130
it is amazing how the dreams and the values

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.119
can make all the difference in the world.

00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:59.749
When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:03.013
I kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be."

00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:08.798
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham

00:14:08.798 --> 00:14:13.763
to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,

00:14:13.763 --> 00:14:16.119
where students are not there just to survive,

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:20.120
where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.661
where they will one day change the world.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:26.036
Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.

00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:32.031
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.

00:14:32.031 --> 00:14:35.963
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives."

00:14:35.963 --> 00:14:38.297
And then he said something that gives me goosebumps.

00:14:38.297 --> 00:14:43.944
He said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."

00:14:43.944 --> 00:14:51.506
Choice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values.

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:53.440
Thank you all very much.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:04.342
(Applause)
