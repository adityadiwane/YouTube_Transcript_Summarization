00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm just going to play a brief video clip.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Video:

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
The buyer

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
was Kip Forbes,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
ChÃ¢teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
the prince of any wine cellar.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
that he had made this incredible discovery.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
he would not reveal
exactly where the building was

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
and he became suspicious.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
But for those 20 years,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.160
an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
not only on wine but on lots of things,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and are they living a better life than me?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.160
I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
in about a dozen categories,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
which was a very grueling quest, 
as you can imagine.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
(Laughter)

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
This was the first one.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
It may come from Wagyu cattle,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And it arrived, and it was tiny. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And I was outraged.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
It was like, 160 dollars for this?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And then I took a bite,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
I almost couldn't finish it.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I was really happy when I was done.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160
(Laughter)

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this project

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
that I did not think that one was really worth the price.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
White truffles. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
in Manhattan -- Del Posto.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
"Would Signore like the truffles?"

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
It's in the smell.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.160
this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
10 seconds passed and it was gone.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
you know, their purpose had been served,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.160
(Laughter)

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Yeah.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
(Laughter)

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
They did give me a tour, though.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
It has 360-degree views.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
It has four balconies.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
which have antibacterial properties.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
but I have to say that nobody here

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160
(Laughter)

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.160
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you, 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
I have not gotten a compliment from anybody 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
in the months that I have owned and worn these.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
should be the test of something's value,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
that's a reasonable benchmark.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
That said, a lot of work goes into these.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
that has been shuttle loomed

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.160
But no compliments.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.160
(Laughter)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Thank you.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
so you can go online and look at your batch number

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
and see how the phenolics are developing,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
and, you know, gauge its freshness.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
It was very green, it was very peppery.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160
for six months.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.160
(Laughter)

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160
you'll start to notice.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
but I did interview a guy who owns them.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
You're paying for the bling,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Oh, yeah, you know this one?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
It's a cat that lives in trees,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160
and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.160
then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160
and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
in the unprocessed form.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
That's right. 

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
Unrelatedly --

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
(Laughter)

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.160
(Laughter)

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
There's one with a fragrance dispenser.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
and transmits the results via email to your doctor.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
It's almost like a home medical center -- 

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
This one does not have those bells and whistles,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160
and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
The seat is preheated. 

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
There's a water jet that cleans you.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
There's an air jet that dries you.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
You get up, it flushes by itself.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
The lid closes, it self-cleans.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Not only is it a technological leap forward,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
And I want to get one of these.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
(Laughter)

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
each buyer gets their name engraved on it.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.160
(Laughter)

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
Lights glaring in off the street, 

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
And you spend a third of your life in bed.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.160
(Laughter)

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
This was a fun one.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
and the most expensive production car. 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
a professional race car driver,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.160
the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And it was really amazing.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
It was such a smooth ride.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
because it was just that smooth.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
(Laughter)

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
When he tries to open the door, 

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
There was one object that I could not get my hands on,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc. 

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
And 1947 was a legendary vintage,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
But it's 60 years old.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
There's not much of it left.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Not that many people are looking to pop open

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
their one remaining bottle for a journalist.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
and it was coming up empty.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And it was going to be a double vertical --

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
and 30 vintages of Yquem.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
I went.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
It was three days, four meals. 

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
And you know, it had this fragrant softness,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
And then I tasted it, and it,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
which is characteristic of that wine --

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
There were some people who were a little less impressed.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
And I wasn't that impressed.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.160
so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And it wasn't just to that wine.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Any one of the wines served at this tasting,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
But drinking 60 great wines over three days,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
they all just blurred together,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
and it became almost a grueling experience.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160
which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
And they gave subjects the same wine,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
labeled with different price tags.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
A lot of people, you know,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
said that they liked the more expensive wine more --

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
that was more expensive.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160
their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
Thank you.
