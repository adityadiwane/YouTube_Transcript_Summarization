00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:16.930
I recently read about
what the young generation of workers want

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:18.805
in Harvard Business Review.

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.841
One thing that stuck out to me
was: don't just talk about impact,

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:25.526
but make an impact.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.547
I'm a little bit older than you,

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.228
maybe much older than you,

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:35.785
but this is exactly the same goal
that I had when I was in college.

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:41.994
I wanted to make my own impact
for those who live under injustice;

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:45.399
it's the reason that I became
a documentary journalist,

00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:46.986
the reason I became

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:50.961
a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.677
It was March 17, 2009.

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:58.242
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:02.820
but it was the day
that turned my life upside down.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:07.947
My team and I were making a documentary
about North Korean refugees

00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.441
living below human life in China.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.082
We were at the border.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.964
It was our last day of filming.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.044
There was no wire fence

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:23.338
or bars

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:25.658
or sign to show that it is the border,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:29.433
but this is a place that a lot
of North Korean defectors use

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:30.919
as an escape route.

00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:34.489
It was still winter,

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:37.006
and the river was frozen.

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:41.181
When we were in the middle
of the frozen river,

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:44.117
we were filming about
the condition of the cold weather

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:45.339
and the environment

00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:48.089
that North Koreans had to deal with

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:49.940
when they seek their freedom.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.114
And suddenly, one
of my team members shouted,

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:55.291
"Soldiers!"

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:57.454
So I looked back,

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:03.126
and there were two small soldiers
in green uniforms with rifles,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.542
chasing after us.

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.746
We all ran as fast as we could.

00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:11.582
I prayed that, please
don't let them shoot my head.

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:14.044
And I was thinking that,

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:16.802
if my feet are on Chinese soil,

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.179
I'll be safe.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.396
And I made it to Chinese soil.

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:25.522
Then I saw my colleague
Laura Ling fall on her knees.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.867
I didn't know what to do
at that short moment,

00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.518
but I knew that I could not
leave her alone there

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:34.533
when she said,
"Euna, I can't feel my legs."

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.483
In a flash, we were surrounded
by these two Korean soldiers.

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:42.850
They were not much bigger than us,

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:46.573
but they were determined
to take us to their army base.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.800
I begged and yelled for any kind of help,

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:53.976
hoping that someone
would show up from China.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:57.118
Here I was, being stubborn

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:00.296
towards a trained soldier with a gun.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.977
I looked at his eyes.

00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:05.886
He was just a boy.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.369
At that moment,
he raised his rifle to hit me,

00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:12.535
but I saw that he was hesitating.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.334
His eyes were shaking,

00:03:14.358 --> 00:03:17.496
and his rifle was still up in the air.

00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:20.299
So I shouted at him,

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:22.629
"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.551
And I got up.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.903
When we arrived at their army base,

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:33.711
my head was spinning
with these worst-case scenarios,

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:36.700
and my colleague's
statement wasn't helping.

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:38.846
She said, "We are the enemy."

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:42.457
She was right: we were the enemy.

00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:45.795
And I was supposed to be frightened, too.

00:03:46.554 --> 00:03:49.530
But I kept having these odd experiences.

00:03:49.554 --> 00:03:53.497
This time, an officer brought me his coat

00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:54.932
to keep me warm,

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:58.947
because I lost my coat on the frozen river

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.178
while battling with one of these soldiers.

00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:06.599
I will tell you what I mean
by these odd experiences.

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:08.916
I grew up in South Korea.

00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.339
To us, North Korea was always the enemy,

00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:14.801
even before I was born.

00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:20.837
South and North have been
under armistice for 63 years,

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.978
since the end of the Korean War.

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:27.498
And growing up in the South
in the '80s and '90s,

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:30.999
we were taught propaganda
about North Korea.

00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:35.649
And we heard so many graphic stories,

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:39.388
such as, a little young boy
being brutally killed

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.888
by North Korean spies
just because he said,

00:04:42.912 --> 00:04:44.285
"I don't like communists."

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:49.273
Or, I watched this cartoon series

00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:54.052
about a young South Korean boy
defeating these fat, big, red pig,

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:58.041
which represented the North Koreans'
first leader at the time.

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:03.819
And the effect of hearing
these horrible stories over and over

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.231
instilled one word in a young mind:

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:09.448
"enemy."

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.373
And I think at some point,
I dehumanized them,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.219
and the people of North Korea
became equated

00:05:19.243 --> 00:05:21.655
with the North Korean government.

00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:25.764
Now, back to my detention.

00:05:25.788 --> 00:05:27.941
It was the second day

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:29.341
of being in a cell.

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:33.255
I had not slept
since I was out at the border.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:37.530
This young guard came to my cell

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:41.070
and offered me this small boiled egg

00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:44.649
and said, "This will give you
strength to keep going."

00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.227
Do you know what it is like,

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:52.718
receiving a small kindness
in the enemy's hand?

00:05:53.832 --> 00:05:56.879
Whenever they were kind to me,
I thought the worst case

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:58.990
was waiting for me after the kindness.

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:03.931
One officer noticed my nervousness.

00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:08.390
He said, "Did you think
we were all these red pigs?"

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.616
referring to the cartoon
that I just showed you.

00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:18.457
Every day was like a psychological battle.

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.572
The interrogator had me sit at a table

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:23.096
six days a week

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.210
and had me writing down
about my journey, my work,

00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:31.949
over and over until I wrote down
the confession that they wanted to hear.

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:36.275
After about three months of detention,

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:41.161
the North Korean court sentenced me

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.669
to 12 years in a labor camp.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:47.455
So I was just sitting in my room
to be transferred.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.604
At that time, I really had
nothing else to do,

00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:53.512
so I paid attention
to these two female guards

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:55.882
and listened to what
they were talking about.

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:58.812
Guard A was older,

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:01.293
and she studied English.

00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:05.284
She seemed like she came
from an affluent family.

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:07.736
She often showed up
with these colorful dresses,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.303
and then loved to show off.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.381
And Guard B was the younger one,

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:15.215
and she was a really good singer.

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:20.991
She loved to sing Celine Dion's
"My Heart Will Go On" --

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.481
sometimes too much.

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:26.337
She knew just how
to torture me without knowing.

00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.005
(Laughter)

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:34.698
And this girl spent a lot of time
in the morning to put on makeup,

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:38.057
like you can see in any young girl's life.

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:43.161
And they loved to watch
this Chinese drama,

00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:44.971
a better quality production.

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:48.022
I remember Guard B said,

00:07:48.992 --> 00:07:52.769
"I can no longer watch our TV shows
after watching this."

00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:55.675
She got scolded

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:59.895
for degrading her own country's
produced TV shows.

00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:03.920
Guard B had more
of a free mind than Guard A,

00:08:03.944 --> 00:08:09.556
and she often got scolded by Guard A
whenever she expressed herself.

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:13.533
One day, they invited
all these female colleagues --

00:08:13.557 --> 00:08:15.458
I don't know where they came from --

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:18.024
to where I was held,

00:08:18.048 --> 00:08:19.616
and they invited me

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.414
to their guard room

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:23.023
and asked

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:26.626
if one-night stands
really happen in the US.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.836
(Laughter)

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.915
This is the country where
young couples are not even allowed

00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:36.619
to hold hands in public.

00:08:36.643 --> 00:08:39.571
I had no idea where they
had gotten this information,

00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:43.172
but they were shy and giggly
even before I said anything.

00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:47.807
I think we all forgot
that I was their prisoner,

00:08:48.668 --> 00:08:52.105
and it was like going back
to my high school classroom again.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.860
And I learned that these girls also
grew up watching a similar cartoon,

00:08:58.884 --> 00:09:03.920
but just propaganda towards
South Korea and the US.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:09.403
I started to understand where
these people's anger was coming from.

00:09:09.427 --> 00:09:13.218
If these girls grew up
learning that we are enemies,

00:09:13.242 --> 00:09:16.463
it was just natural
that they would hate us

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:18.316
just as I feared them.

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:23.705
But at that moment, we were all just girls

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.522
who shared the same interests,

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:30.161
beyond our ideologies that separated us.

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:36.296
I shared these stories with my boss
at Current TV at the time

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.730
after I came home.

00:09:37.754 --> 00:09:40.232
His first reaction was,

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:43.148
"Euna, have you heard
of Stockholm Syndrome?"

00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:48.131
Yes, and I clearly remember

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.633
the feeling of fear

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:52.164
and being threatened,

00:09:53.557 --> 00:09:57.362
and tension rising up
between me and the interrogator

00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:59.355
when we talked about politics.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:03.391
There definitely was a wall
that we couldn't climb over.

00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:08.216
But we were able to see
each other as human beings

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.641
when we talked about family,

00:10:10.665 --> 00:10:12.242
everyday life,

00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:15.177
the importance of the future
for our children.

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:21.286
It was about a month before I came home.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.642
I got really sick.

00:10:23.452 --> 00:10:27.543
Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,

00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:30.396
because she was leaving
the detention center.

00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:35.815
She made sure that no one watched us,

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:37.423
no one heard us,

00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:39.002
and quietly said,

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:40.856
"I hope you get better

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.781
and go back to your family soon."

00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:46.763
It is these people --

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.304
the officer who brought me his coat,

00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:54.844
the guard who offered me a boiled egg,

00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:59.598
these female guards who asked me
about dating life in the US --

00:10:59.622 --> 00:11:04.195
they are the ones
that I remember of North Korea:

00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:06.642
humans just like us.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:13.009
North Koreans and I were not
ambassadors of our countries,

00:11:13.033 --> 00:11:16.618
but I believe that we were representing

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:18.147
the human race.

00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:22.806
Now I'm back home and back to my life.

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:28.733
The memory of these people
has blurred as time has passed.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.056
And I'm in this place

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.377
where I read and hear
about North Korea provoking the US.

00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:38.267
I realized how easy it is

00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:41.005
to see them as an enemy again.

00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:48.110
But I have to keep reminding myself
that when I was over there,

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.389
I was able to see humanity

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:53.565
over hatred

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.180
in my enemy's eyes.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:57.996
Thank you.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.154
