00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:14.420
Here's an intriguing fact.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.836
In the developed world,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.020
everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.956
Six to eight years longer.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.860
That's, like, a huge gap.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.516
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.996
showing that men in rich countries

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.996
are twice as likely to die as women are

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.220
at any age.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.796
But there is one place in the world

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.740
where men live as long as women.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.356
It's a remote, mountainous zone,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.596
a blue zone,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.116
where super longevity

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.940
is common to both sexes.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.676
This is the blue zone in Sardinia,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.716
an Italian island in the Mediterranean,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.356
between Corsica and Tunisia,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.756
where there are six times
as many centenarians

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.676
as on the Italian mainland,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.300
less than 200 miles away.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.636
There are 10 times as many centenarians

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.460
as there are in North America.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.380
It's the only place
where men live as long as women.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.276
But why?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.940
My curiosity was piqued.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.876
I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.316
and I started with the genetic profile.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.396
I discovered soon enough

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.436
that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.980
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.580
So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.580
What are they doing right?

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.476
What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.036
It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.196
where I went to investigate this,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.940
and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.276
density is:

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.276
tightly spaced houses,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.836
interwoven alleys and streets.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460
It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.836
And as I walked through the village,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.996
I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.636
from behind doorways and curtains,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.396
from behind shutters.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.836
Because like all ancient villages,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.436
Villagrande couldn't have survived

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.716
without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.636
without its village square,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.820
because defense and social cohesion
defined its design.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.716
Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.596
because infectious disease
became the risk of the day.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.820
But what about now?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.100
Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.276
Now, a third of the population says

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900
they have two or fewer people to lean on.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.556
But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.636
to meet some centenarians.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.556
Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.636
and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.596
He was a gregarious man.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.916
He loved to recount stories

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.596
such as how he lived like a bird

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.916
from what he could find
on the forest floor

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.316
during not one but two world wars,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.436
how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.796
raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.020
where I interviewed him.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.396
Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.476
both in their 70s
and looking after their father,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.756
and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.516
who came along with me
on this research trip,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.356
because the flip side of social cohesion

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.196
is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.116
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.076
He was a happy-go-lucky guy,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.756
very outgoing with a positive outlook.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.316
And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.540
thinking positively?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.036
Actually, no.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.620
(Laughter)

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.276
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.316
the grumpiest person I have ever met.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.836
(Laughter)

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.556
And he put a lie to the notion

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.140
that you have to be positive
to live a long life.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.956
And there is evidence for this.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.516
When I asked him why he lived so long,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.956
he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.116
"Nobody has to know my secrets."

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.356
(Laughter)

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.596
But despite being a sourpuss,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.956
the niece who lived with him
and looked after him

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.540
called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure."

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.356
And she respected him and loved him,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.060
and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.076
"You just don't understand, do you?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.796
Looking after this man is a pleasure.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.796
It's a huge privilege for me.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.140
This is my heritage."

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.516
And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.820
I found a kitchen party.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:56.996
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.236
Maria above him

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.196
and beside him his great-niece Sara,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.996
who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.316
And I quickly discovered by being there

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.596
that in the blue zone, as people age,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.076
and indeed across their lifespans,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.196
they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.516
by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.836
People are always there or dropping by.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.980
They are never left
to live solitary lives.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.116
This is unlike the rest
of the developed world,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.596
where as George Burns quipped,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.660
"Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city."

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.796
(Laughter)

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.236
Now, so far we've only met men,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.356
long-living men, but I met women too,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.980
and here you see Zia Teresa.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.876
She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.556
which is called culurgiones,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.356
which are these large pasta pockets

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.540
like ravioli about this size,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.476
this size,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.036
and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.836
and drenched in tomato sauce.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.100
And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.596
so they wouldn't open,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.636
and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.620
and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.476
And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.116
is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.396
(Applause)

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.036
Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.876
prompted me to ask myself
some questions too,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.540
such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.860
And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.556
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.476
and she addressed this very question

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.996
in a series of studies

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.916
of tens of thousands of middle aged people

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.076
much like this audience here.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.036
And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle:

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.196
their diet, their exercise,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.716
their marital status,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.396
how often they went to the doctor,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.916
whether they smoked or drank, etc.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.156
She recorded all of this

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.756
and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.500
to see who would still be breathing.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.700
And of the people left standing,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.700
what reduced their chances
of dying the most?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.876
That was her question.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.436
So let's now look at her data in summary,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.196
going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.436
OK?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.716
So clean air, which is great,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.780
it doesn't predict how long you will live.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.556
Whether you have your hypertension treated

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.916
is good.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.716
Still not a strong predictor.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.236
Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.636
because it's only in third place.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.156
How much exercise you get is next,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.516
still only a moderate predictor.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.276
Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.836
getting higher now.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.476
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.756
Did anybody here know

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.580
that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise?

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.036
Whether you were drinking and quit,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.036
or whether you're a moderate drinker,

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.540
whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.996
and getting towards the top predictors

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.556
are two features of your social life.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.956
First, your close relationships.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.276
These are the people
that you can call on for a loan

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.916
if you need money suddenly,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.516
who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.356
or who will take you to the hospital,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.196
or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.196
if you're in despair.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.835
Those people, that little clutch of people

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:49.396
are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.756
And then something that surprised me,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.396
something that's called
social integration.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.476
This means how much
you interact with people

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.900
as you move through your day.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.676
How many people do you talk to?

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.276
And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.796
so not just the people
you're really close to,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.196
who mean a lot to you,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.756
but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.556
Do you talk to the postman?

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.036
Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.036
Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.236
Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.596
of how long you'll live.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.580
Now, this leads me to the next question:

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:36.076
if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.756
including sleeping,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.956
we're now up to 11 hours a day,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.476
one hour more than last year, by the way,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.316
does it make a difference?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.356
Why distinguish
between interacting in person

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.596
and interacting via social media?

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.476
Is it the same thing as being there

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.180
if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.156
Well, the short answer
to the question is no,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.836
it's not the same thing.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.676
Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.996
and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.876
and well into the future.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.420
So simply making
eye contact with somebody,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.996
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.076
is enough to release oxytocin,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.316
which increases your level of trust

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.180
and it lowers your cortisol levels.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.580
So it lowers your stress.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.076
And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.316
and it kills pain.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.260
It's like a naturally produced morphine.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.676
Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar,

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.380
which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.356
But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.716
that there is a difference.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.796
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.116
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.956
tried to map the difference

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.636
between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.876
versus when we're watching
something that's static.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.329
And what she did was
she compared the brain function

00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:04.396
of two groups of people,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.716
those interacting live with her

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.876
or with one of her research associates

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.076
in a dynamic conversation,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.596
and she compared that
to the brain activity of people

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.356
who were watching her talk
about the same subject

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.860
but in a canned video, like on YouTube.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.396
And by the way, if you want to know

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.236
how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.460
talk to me later.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.580
So what's the difference?

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.820
This is your brain
on real social interaction.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.556
What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.716
between interacting in person
and taking in static content.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.716
In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.956
social intelligence --

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.556
that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.316
and feeling and planning --

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.876
and emotional reward.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.676
And these areas become much more engaged

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.980
when we're interacting
with a live partner.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.636
Now, these richer brain signatures

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.716
might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.676
evaluating candidates

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.476
thought that the candidates were smarter

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.980
when they heard their voices

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.236
compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.676
or an email or a letter.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.476
Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.516
It shows that we're thinking, feeling,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.196
sentient human beings

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.716
who are much more than an algorithm.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.796
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.100
at the University of Chicago
Business School

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.940
is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.636
If somebody hears your voice,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.980
they think you're smarter.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.740
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.060
Now, to return to the beginning,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.756
why do women live longer than men?

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.116
And one major reason
is that women are more likely

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.516
to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.196
over their lifespans.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.876
Fresh evidence shows

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.596
that these in-person friendships

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.596
create a biological force field
against disease and decline.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.796
And it's not just true of humans

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.196
but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.876
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.796
who have a core of female friends

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.396
show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.900
they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.836
At least three stable relationships.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.356
That was the magic number.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.596
Think about it.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.906
I hope you guys have three.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.540
The power of such face-to-face contact

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.116
is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.956
among people who are socially engaged.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.796
It's why women who have breast cancer

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:51.116
are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.116
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.796
or to have coffee

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.076
or to play old-timer's hockey --

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.396
I'm Canadian, after all --

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.556
(Laughter)

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.076
are better protected
by that social contact

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.116
than they are by medication.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.236
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly --

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.716
this is something very
powerful they can do.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.436
This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.940
yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.316
We can do something about this.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.116
Like Sardinian villagers,

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.836
it's a biological imperative
to know we belong,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.876
and not just the women among us.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.036
Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.540
into our agendas

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.116
bolsters the immune system,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.156
sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.780
and helps us live longer.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.316
I call this building your village,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.940
and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.796
Thank you.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.500
(Applause)

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.716
Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.636
I'm wondering if there's a middle path.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.076
So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.756
but what about digital technology?

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.356
We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.836
like FaceTime, things like that.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.116
Does that work too?

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.396
I mean, I see my nephew.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.836
He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.876
It seems like he's connecting pretty well.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.676
Is that useful? Is that helpful?

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.036
Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.036
The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.796
and the health data trailed behind.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.196
So we're just learning,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.236
but I would say
there are some improvements

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.076
that we could make in the technology.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.556
For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.636
so for example, when you're
looking into the screen,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.556
you're not actually making eye contact.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.756
So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.036
can increase those neurotransmitters,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.636
or maybe changing
the position of the camera.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.356
So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.116
HW: Great. Thank you so much.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.356
SP: Thank you.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.530
(Applause)
