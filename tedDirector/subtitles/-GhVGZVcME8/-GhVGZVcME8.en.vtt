00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:16.170
(Guitar)

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:30.881
(Singing)

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:34.971
Rollercoaster,

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.031
carousel.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:43.332
Where the highs are heaven,

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:44.441
but the lows,

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.030
oh, they can be hell.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.806
You can grab the ring,

00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:54.241
you can ring that bell,

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.590
when the ride is over,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.554
you can never tell.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:07.678
People tell you this one thing --

00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:10.361
will make your life complete.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:11.791
So you,

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.328
you give it everything you got

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:17.858
and you wind up on the street.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.529
Then one day you wake up,

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:27.478
and they tell you "you're a queen,"

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:31.285
but then you find that someone else

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:33.462
is pulling on the strings.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:37.722
Rollercoaster,

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.282
carousel.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.825
Where the highs are heaven,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:46.901
but the lows,

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:49.540
oh, they can be hell.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.126
You can grab the ring,

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.597
you can ring that bell,

00:01:56.597 --> 00:02:00.861
when the ride is over,

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:03.295
you can never tell.

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:07.332
The one you love,

00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:08.381
they love you --

00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.012
oh yeah --

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:13.044
until the end of time.

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:16.521
But lose your edge or lose your cool,

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.353
they will drop you like a dime.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:25.500
Everyone is crowding 'round

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.360
when fortune is your friend.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.215
When your luck is running out,

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.440
you're all alone again.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.615
Rollercoaster,

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:42.994
carousel.

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:47.723
Where the highs are heaven

00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:48.903
but the lows,

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:51.239
oh, they can be hell.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.953
You can grab the ring,

00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:58.349
you can ring that bell,

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.583
when the ride is over

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.362
you can never tell.

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:11.868
Well, maybe I'm just cynical,

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:15.858
and all these words are lies,

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:18.649
but experience keeps telling me

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.671
that the cautious one is wise.

00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:27.524
But caution makes you hesitate,

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:31.422
and hesitate you're lost,

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:35.329
so take your opportunities

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.509
and never count the cost.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.559
Rollercoaster,

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.017
carousel.

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:49.671
Where the highs are heaven,

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.041
but the lows,

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.309
oh, they can be hell.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.771
You can grab the ring,

00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:00.257
you can ring that bell,

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:02.791
when the ride is over --

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.564
over, over,

00:04:04.564 --> 00:04:08.381
you can never, ever tell.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.224
Rollercoaster,

00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:16.099
carousel,

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.914
rollercoaster,

00:04:17.914 --> 00:04:20.017
yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:23.528
carousel.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:27.731
Carousel,

00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.781
carousel,

00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.617
carousel,

00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:44.452
carousel.

00:04:45.297 --> 00:04:47.895

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.631
Michael Pemberton.

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:53.082

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:55.505
Thank you so much.

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:56.580
Thank you.
