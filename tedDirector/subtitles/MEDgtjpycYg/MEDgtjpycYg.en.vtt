00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.857
Speaking up is hard to do.

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:21.507
I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago,

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.434
when my wife and I became new parents.

00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:26.791
It was an amazing moment.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.000
It was exhilarating and elating,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.345
but it was also scary and terrifying.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.571
And it got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital,

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.056
and we were unsure

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.169
whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:45.943
And we wanted to call our pediatrician,

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.542
but we also didn't want
to make a bad first impression

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.030
or come across as a crazy,
neurotic parent.

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:52.701
So we worried.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:54.107
And we waited.

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.426
When we got to the doctor's office
the next day,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.704
she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated.

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:02.746
Our son is fine now,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.726
and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her.

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.632
But in that moment,

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:10.290
I should've spoken up, but I didn't.

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:14.238
But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't,

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:18.188
and I learned that over 10 years ago
when I let my twin brother down.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.221
My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker,

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:22.775
and for one of his first films,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.414
he got an offer
from a distribution company.

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:26.776
He was excited,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.467
and he was inclined to accept the offer.

00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.584
But as a negotiations researcher,

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.561
I insisted he make a counteroffer,

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:37.815
and I helped him craft the perfect one.

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:39.520
And it was perfect --

00:01:39.544 --> 00:01:41.548
it was perfectly insulting.

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:44.136
The company was so offended,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.209
they literally withdrew the offer

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.450
and my brother was left with nothing.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:52.334
And I've asked people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up:

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:54.192
when they can assert themselves,

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.930
when they can push their interests,

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:58.149
when they can express an opinion,

00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:00.384
when they can make an ambitious ask.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:05.120
And the range of stories
are varied and diverse,

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:07.815
but they also make up
a universal tapestry.

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.517
Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake?

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:14.644
Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes?

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:18.063
Can I challenge my friend's
insensitive joke?

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.486
Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities?

00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:25.676
And through these experiences,
I've come to recognize

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.557
that each of us have something called
a range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:34.832
Now, sometimes we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.619
That's what happened with my brother.

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:41.269
Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:43.187
But sometimes we're too weak.

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:45.275
That's what happened with my wife and I.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.515
And this range of acceptable behaviors --

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.634
when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded.

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:54.827
When we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways.

00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.990
We get dismissed or demeaned
or even ostracized.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:01.273
Or we lose that raise
or that promotion or that deal.

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.693
Now, the first thing we need to know is:

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.205
What is my range?

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:10.689
But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed;

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:12.681
it's actually pretty dynamic.

00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:16.961
It expands and it narrows
based on the context.

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:21.472
And there's one thing that determines
that range more than anything else,

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:23.331
and that's your power.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:25.512
Your power determines your range.

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:26.973
What is power?

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.764
Power comes in lots of forms.

00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:31.877
In negotiations, it comes
in the form of alternatives.

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.901
So my brother had no alternatives;

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:35.112
he lacked power.

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.956
The company had lots of alternatives;

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.146
they had power.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.230
Sometimes it's being new
to a country, like an immigrant,

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.713
or new to an organization

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:44.296
or new to an experience,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.425
like my wife and I as new parents.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.950
Sometimes it's at work,

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:50.585
where someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate.

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.293
Sometimes it's in relationships,

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:55.298
where one person's more invested
than the other person.

00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:58.837
And the key thing is that when
we have lots of power,

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.690
our range is very wide.

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:03.345
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:06.141
But when we lack power, our range narrows.

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.332
We have very little leeway.

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:11.729
The problem is that when
our range narrows,

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:15.856
that produces something called
the low-power double bind.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.983
The low-power double bind happens

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:21.944
when, if we don't speak up,
we go unnoticed,

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:24.918
but if we do speak up, we get punished.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.070
Now, many of you have heard
the phrase the "double bind"

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:31.041
and connected it with one thing,
and that's gender.

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:35.275
The gender double bind is women
who don't speak up go unnoticed,

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:37.730
and women who do speak up get punished.

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:43.111
And the key thing is that women have
the same need as men to speak up,

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:45.032
but they have barriers to doing so.

00:04:46.004 --> 00:04:49.282
But what my research has shown
over the last two decades

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:52.587
is that what looks
like a gender difference

00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:55.432
is not really a gender double bind,

00:04:55.456 --> 00:04:57.812
it's a really a low-power double bind.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:04:59.720
And what looks like a gender difference

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:02.850
are really often just power
differences in disguise.

00:05:03.394 --> 00:05:06.117
Oftentimes we see a difference
between a man and a woman

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:07.339
or men and women,

00:05:07.363 --> 00:05:10.971
and think, "Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:12.241
about the sexes."

00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:14.119
But in study after study,

00:05:14.143 --> 00:05:18.349
I've found that a better explanation
for many sex differences

00:05:18.893 --> 00:05:20.405
is really power.

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:23.496
And so it's the low-power double bind.

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:28.791
And the low-power double bind
means that we have a narrow range,

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:30.645
and we lack power.

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.901
We have a narrow range,

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.847
and our double bind is very large.

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.691
So we need to find ways
to expand our range.

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:38.292
And over the last couple decades,

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:41.297
my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter.

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:45.892
The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes.

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:49.605
The second: you seem powerful
in the eyes of others.

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.484
When I feel powerful,

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.992
I feel confident, not fearful;

00:05:54.016 --> 00:05:55.858
I expand my own range.

00:05:55.882 --> 00:05:58.028
When other people see me as powerful,

00:05:58.614 --> 00:06:01.150
they grant me a wider range.

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:05.928
So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior.

00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:08.343
And I'm going to give you
a set of tools today.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.985
Speaking up is risky,

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:14.432
but these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up.

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:20.901
The first tool I'm going to give you
got discovered in negotiations

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.305
in an important finding.

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:26.225
On average, women make
less ambitious offers

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.723
and get worse outcomes than men
at the bargaining table.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.317
But Hannah Riley Bowles
and Emily Amanatullah have discovered

00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:37.019
there's one situation
where women get the same outcomes as men

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:38.642
and are just as ambitious.

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:42.804
That's when they advocate for others.

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.388
When they advocate for others,

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:50.289
they discover their own range
and expand it in their own mind.

00:06:50.313 --> 00:06:51.722
They become more assertive.

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:54.620
This is sometimes called
"the mama bear effect."

00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:57.742
Like a mama bear defending her cubs,

00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:01.714
when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice.

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.445
But sometimes, we have
to advocate for ourselves.

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:06.809
How do we do that?

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:10.838
One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves

00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:13.234
is something called perspective-taking.

00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:16.010
And perspective-taking is really simple:

00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:20.319
it's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person.

00:07:21.014 --> 00:07:24.802
It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range.

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:26.533
When I take your perspective,

00:07:26.557 --> 00:07:28.996
and I think about what you really want,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.390
you're more likely to give me
what I really want.

00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:34.961
But here's the problem:

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:37.266
perspective-taking is hard to do.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.820
So let's do a little experiment.

00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:41.858
I want you all to hold
your hand just like this:

00:07:41.882 --> 00:07:43.177
your finger -- put it up.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.002
And I want you to draw
a capital letter E on your forehead

00:07:48.026 --> 00:07:49.607
as quickly as possible.

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:55.383
OK, it turns out that we can
draw this E in one of two ways,

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:58.892
and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.837
I'm going to show you two pictures

00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:02.861
of someone with an E on their forehead --

00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:04.743
my former student, Erika Hall.

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:07.262
And you can see over here,

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.553
that's the correct E.

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:12.027
I drew the E so it looks like
an E to another person.

00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:14.158
That's the perspective-taking E

00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:17.237
because it looks like an E
from someone else's vantage point.

00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:20.271
But this E over here
is the self-focused E.

00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:22.509
We often get self-focused.

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:25.500
And we particularly get
self-focused in a crisis.

00:08:26.064 --> 00:08:28.235
I want to tell you
about a particular crisis.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:31.263
A man walks into a bank
in Watsonville, California.

00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:34.724
And he says, "Give me $2,000,

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:37.044
or I'm blowing the whole bank
up with a bomb."

00:08:37.503 --> 00:08:40.028
Now, the bank manager
didn't give him the money.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.351
She took a step back.

00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:43.329
She took his perspective,

00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:45.720
and she noticed something
really important.

00:08:45.744 --> 00:08:48.450
He asked for a specific amount of money.

00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:49.679
So she said,

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:52.928
"Why did you ask for $2,000?"

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:55.633
And he said, "My friend
is going to be evicted

00:08:55.657 --> 00:08:57.920
unless I get him $2,000 immediately."

00:08:57.944 --> 00:09:00.994
And she said, "Oh! You don't want
to rob the bank --

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:02.506
you want to take out a loan."

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.615
(Laughter)

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:05.512
"Why don't you come back to my office,

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.715
and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."

00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:08.778
(Laughter)

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:13.717
Now, her quick perspective-taking
defused a volatile situation.

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:16.095
So when we take someone's perspective,

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:20.725
it allows us to be ambitious
and assertive, but still be likable.

00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:24.450
Here's another way to be assertive
but still be likable,

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:27.005
and that is to signal flexibility.

00:09:27.413 --> 00:09:31.475
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,
and you want to sell someone a car.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.793
You're going to more likely make the sale
if you give them two options.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.564
Let's say option A:

00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:40.688
$24,000 for this car
and a five-year warranty.

00:09:41.084 --> 00:09:42.257
Or option B:

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:45.493
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.

00:09:45.845 --> 00:09:49.423
My research shows that when you give
people a choice among options,

00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:51.336
it lowers their defenses,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.558
and they're more likely
to accept your offer.

00:09:54.202 --> 00:09:56.319
And this doesn't just
work with salespeople;

00:09:56.343 --> 00:09:57.534
it works with parents.

00:09:57.558 --> 00:09:58.837
When my niece was four,

00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:01.778
she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.688
But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea.

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:07.630
What if I gave my daughter a choice?

00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:09.675
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:11.821
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:13.183
And it worked brilliantly.

00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:16.741
She got dressed quickly
and without resistance.

00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:19.785
When I've asked the question
around the world

00:10:19.809 --> 00:10:21.860
when people feel comfortable speaking up,

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:23.220
the number one answer is:

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:27.998
"When I have social support
in my audience; when I have allies."

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:31.568
So we want to get allies on our side.

00:10:31.957 --> 00:10:33.227
How do we do that?

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:36.010
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:37.510
When we advocate for others,

00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:41.063
we expand our range in our own eyes
and the eyes of others,

00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:43.243
but we also earn strong allies.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:48.513
Another way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places,

00:10:48.537 --> 00:10:51.386
is by asking other people for advice.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:57.291
When we ask others for advice,
they like us because we flatter them,

00:10:57.315 --> 00:10:58.802
and we're expressing humility.

00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:02.477
And this really works to solve
another double bind.

00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:05.159
And that's the self-promotion double bind.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.002
The self-promotion double bind

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:10.181
is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments,

00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:11.415
no one notices.

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:13.843
And if we do, we're not likable.

00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:17.433
But if we ask for advice
about one of our accomplishments,

00:11:17.457 --> 00:11:21.767
we are able to be competent
in their eyes but also be likeable.

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:24.502
And this is so powerful

00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:27.074
it even works when you see it coming.

00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:31.509
There have been multiple times in life
when I have been forewarned

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:35.971
that a low-power person has been given
the advice to come ask me for advice.

00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:38.531
I want you to notice
three things about this:

00:11:38.555 --> 00:11:41.543
First, I knew they were going
to come ask me for advice.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.932
Two, I've actually done research
on the strategic benefits

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.257
of asking for advice.

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:50.208
And three, it still worked!

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:51.873
I took their perspective,

00:11:51.897 --> 00:11:54.084
I became more invested in their cause,

00:11:54.108 --> 00:11:57.914
I became more committed to them
because they asked for advice.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.527
Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up

00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:03.690
is when we have expertise.

00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:06.299
Expertise gives us credibility.

00:12:06.862 --> 00:12:09.789
When we have high power,
we already have credibility.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.278
We only need good evidence.

00:12:11.777 --> 00:12:14.747
When we lack power,
we don't have the credibility.

00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:17.033
We need excellent evidence.

00:12:17.394 --> 00:12:21.141
And one of the ways
we can come across as an expert

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.263
is by tapping into our passion.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:27.958
I want everyone in the next few days
to go up to friend of theirs

00:12:27.982 --> 00:12:29.227
and just say to them,

00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:31.961
"I want you to describe
a passion of yours to me."

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:35.223
I've had people do this all over the world

00:12:35.247 --> 00:12:36.503
and I asked them,

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.696
"What did you notice
about the other person

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.774
when they described their passion?"

00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:42.698
And the answers are always the same.

00:12:42.722 --> 00:12:44.730
"Their eyes lit up and got big."

00:12:44.754 --> 00:12:47.703
"They smiled a big beaming smile."

00:12:47.727 --> 00:12:49.371
"They used their hands all over --

00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:51.877
I had to duck because their
hands were coming at me."

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:54.112
"They talk quickly
with a little higher pitch."

00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:55.110
(Laughter)

00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:57.578
"They leaned in
as if telling me a secret."

00:12:57.602 --> 00:12:58.923
And then I said to them,

00:12:58.947 --> 00:13:02.021
"What happened to you
as you listened to their passion?"

00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:04.654
They said, "My eyes lit up.

00:13:04.678 --> 00:13:05.948
I smiled.

00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:07.345
I leaned in."

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:09.438
When we tap into our passion,

00:13:09.462 --> 00:13:12.828
we give ourselves the courage,
in our own eyes, to speak up,

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:15.720
but we also get the permission
from others to speak up.

00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:21.824
Tapping into our passion even works
when we come across as too weak.

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:27.007
Both men and women get punished
at work when they shed tears.

00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:33.762
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when
we frame our strong emotions as passion,

00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:39.872
the condemnation of our crying
disappears for both men and women.

00:13:40.598 --> 00:13:44.066
I want to end with a few words
from my late father

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.251
that he spoke at my twin
brother's wedding.

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.260
Here's a picture of us.

00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:51.921
My dad was a psychologist like me,

00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:55.667
but his real love and his real
passion was cinema,

00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:56.891
like my brother.

00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:59.481
And so he wrote a speech
for my brother's wedding

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.654
about the roles we play
in the human comedy.

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:04.967
And he said, "The lighter your touch,

00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:08.843
the better you become at improving
and enriching your performance.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.256
Those who embrace their roles
and work to improve their performance

00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:16.620
grow, change and expand the self.

00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.375
Play it well,

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.372
and your days will be mostly joyful."

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:22.571
What my dad was saying

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:26.381
is that we've all been assigned
ranges and roles in this world.

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:30.513
But he was also saying
the essence of this talk:

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:36.022
those roles and ranges are constantly
expanding and evolving.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.532
So when a scene calls for it,

00:14:39.114 --> 00:14:40.730
be a ferocious mama bear

00:14:41.251 --> 00:14:42.893
and a humble advice seeker.

00:14:43.802 --> 00:14:47.515
Have excellent evidence and strong allies.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.248
Be a passionate perspective taker.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.490
And if you use those tools --

00:14:52.514 --> 00:14:56.080
and each and every one of you
can use these tools --

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.970
you will expand your range
of acceptable behavior,

00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:02.952
and your days will be mostly joyful.

00:15:04.082 --> 00:15:05.232
Thank you.

00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:07.687
(Applause)
