00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:20.958
Life is about opportunities --
creating them and embracing them.

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:24.069
And for me, that was the Olympic dream.

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:26.898
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.937
As a cross-country skier
and member of the Australian ski team

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.068
headed towards the Winter Olympics,

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:36.472
I was on a training bike ride
with my fellow teammates.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:40.800
As we made our way up
towards the spectacular Blue Mountains

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:41.975
west of Sydney,

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.439
it was the perfect autumn day:

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:48.625
sunshine, the smell
of eucalypt and a dream.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.894
Life was good.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.121
We'd been on our bikes
for around five-and-a-half hours

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.571
when we got to the part
of the ride that I loved,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.316
and that was the hills,
because I loved the hills.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.241
I got up off the seat of my bike
and I started pumping my legs,

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:06.083
and as I sucked in the cold mountain air,
I could feel it burning my lungs,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.213
and I looked up to see
the sun shining in my face.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.258
And then everything went black.

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:15.951
Where was I? What was happening?

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.801
My body was consumed by pain.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.928
I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck

00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:25.487
with only 10 minutes
to go on the bike ride.

00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:29.426
I was airlifted from the scene
of the accident by a rescue helicopter

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.721
to a large spinal unit in Sydney.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.491
I had extensive
and life-threatening injuries.

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:38.494
I'd broken my neck
and my back in six places.

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:41.461
I broke five ribs on my left side.

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:44.269
I broke my right arm.
I broke my collarbone.

00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:46.138
I broke some bones in my feet.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.665
My whole right side was ripped open,
filled with gravel.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.070
My head was cut open
across the front, lifted back,

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:53.767
exposing the skull underneath.

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.893
I had head injures.
I had internal injuries.

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:57.247
I had massive blood loss.

00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.350
In fact, I lost
about five liters of blood,

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:01.929
which is all someone my size
would actually hold.

00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:05.523
By the time the helicopter arrived
at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,

00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:08.127
my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.247
I was having a really bad day.

00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:17.602
(Laughter)

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.436
For over 10 days, I drifted
between two dimensions.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.659
I had an awareness of being in my body,

00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.935
but also being out of my body,
somewhere else,

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.982
watching from above,
as if it was happening to someone else.

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.364
Why would I want to go back
to a body that was so broken?

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:37.172
But this voice kept calling me:

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:39.390
"Come on, stay with me."

00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:42.192
"No, it's too hard."

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:45.127
"Come on. This is our opportunity."

00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:49.737
"No. That body is broken.
It can no longer serve me."

00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.686
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it.
We can do it together."

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:56.513
I was at a crossroads.

00:02:57.137 --> 00:03:00.799
I knew if I didn't return to my body,
I'd have to leave this world forever.

00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:03.666
It was the fight of my life.

00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:09.303
After 10 days, I made the decision
to return to my body.

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.576
And the internal bleeding stopped.

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:17.397
The next concern
was whether I would walk again,

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:19.731
because I was paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:23.414
They said to my parents
that the neck break was a stable fracture,

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:25.179
but the back was completely crushed:

00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:28.589
the vertebra at L1
was like you'd dropped a peanut,

00:03:28.613 --> 00:03:31.704
stepped on it, smashed it
into thousands of pieces.

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:33.120
They'd have to operate.

00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:36.642
They went in. They put me on a beanbag.

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.750
They cut me -- literally cut me in half.

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.208
I have a scar that wraps
around my entire body.

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:44.977
They picked as much
broken bone as they could

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:46.678
that had lodged in my spinal cord.

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:50.636
They took out two of my broken ribs
and they rebuilt my back --

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.303
L1, they rebuilt it,
they took out another broken rib,

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:56.716
they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.921
Then they stitched me up;
they took an entire hour to stitch me up.

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:01.574
I woke up in intensive care,

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:05.230
and the doctors were really excited
that the operation had been a success,

00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:07.825
because at that stage,
I had a little bit of movement

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.007
in one of my big toes,

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:12.071
and I thought, "Great,
because I'm going to the Olympics!"

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.131
(Laughter)

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:15.761
I had no idea.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:19.317
That's the sort of thing that happens
to someone else, not me, surely.

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:21.722
But then the doctor
came over to me and she said,

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:24.556
"Janine, the operation was a success,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.318
and we've picked as much bone
out of your spinal cord as we could.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:29.731
But the damage is permanent.

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:32.803
The central nervous system
nerves -- there is no cure.

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.676
You're what we call a partial paraplegic,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.668
and you'll have all of the injuries
that go along with that.

00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:41.555
You'll have no feeling
from the waist down,

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:44.606
and at most, you might get
10 or 20 percent return.

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.018
You'll have internal injuries
for the rest of your life.

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.777
You'll have to use a catheter
for the rest of your life.

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.938
And if you walk again, it will be
with calipers and a walking frame."

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.137
And then she said,

00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.287
"Janine, you'll have to rethink
everything you do in your life,

00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.982
because you're never going to be able
to do the things you did before."

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.083
(Gasps)

00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:07.519
I tried to grasp what she was saying.

00:05:07.543 --> 00:05:10.260
I was an athlete. That's all I knew.
That's all I'd done.

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:13.088
If I couldn't do that,
then what could I do?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.922
And the question I asked myself is:

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:16.423
If I couldn't do that,

00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:18.617
then who was I?

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:26.385
They moved me from intensive care
to acute spinal.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.639
I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.

00:05:28.663 --> 00:05:30.124
I had no movement in my legs.

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:33.496
I had tight stockings on
to protect from blood clots.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.387
I had one arm in plaster,
one arm tied down by drips.

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.387
I had a neck brace and sandbags
on either side of my head

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:41.357
and I saw my world through a mirror

00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.455
that was suspended above my head.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.813
I shared the ward with five other people,

00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:49.139
and the amazing thing is,

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:52.709
because we were all lying paralyzed
in a spinal ward,

00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:55.139
we didn't know
what each other looked like.

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:56.957
How amazing is that?

00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:03.115
How often in life do you get to make
friendships, judgment-free,

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.105
purely based on spirit?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.693
And there were
no superficial conversations

00:06:08.717 --> 00:06:11.767
as we shared our innermost
thoughts, our fears,

00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:14.743
and our hopes for life
after the spinal ward.

00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:20.213
I remember one night,
one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,

00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:23.287
with a whole lot of plastic straws.

00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.573
He put a pile on top
of each of us, and he said,

00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:27.773
"Start threading them together."

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:31.723
Well, there wasn't much else to do
in the spinal ward, so we did.

00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:32.772
(Laughter)

00:06:32.796 --> 00:06:35.613
And when we'd finished,
he went around silently

00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:40.953
and he joined all of the straws up
till it looped around the whole ward.

00:06:40.977 --> 00:06:42.144
And then he said,

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:45.012
"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.287
And we did. And he said, "Right ...

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:51.128
Now we're all connected."

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.968
And as we held on and we breathed as one,

00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:00.603
we knew we weren't on this journey alone.

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:06.019
And even lying paralyzed
in the spinal ward ...

00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:10.195
there were moments of incredible
depth and richness,

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:12.695
of authenticity and connection

00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:15.901
that I had never experienced before.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:20.736
And each of us knew
that when we left the spinal ward,

00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:24.152
we would never be the same.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:30.284
After six months, it was time to go home.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.702
I remember Dad pushing me
outside in my wheelchair,

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.860
wrapped in a plaster body cast,

00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:40.866
and feeling the sun on my face
for the first time.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.289
I soaked it up and I thought,

00:07:42.313 --> 00:07:45.541
"How could I ever
have taken this for granted?"

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.461
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.

00:07:50.463 --> 00:07:51.843
But before I left hospital,

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:54.899
the head nurse had said to me,
"Janine, I want you to be ready,

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:57.608
because when you get home,
something's going to happen."

00:07:57.632 --> 00:07:58.797
And I said, "What?"

00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.534
And she said, "You're going
to get depressed."

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:04.544
And I said, "Not me,
not Janine the Machine,"

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:06.282
which was my nickname.

00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:09.389
She said, "You are, because,
see, it happens to everyone.

00:08:09.413 --> 00:08:13.664
In the spinal ward, that's normal.
You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:17.283
But you're going to get home
and realize how different life is."

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.346
And I got home.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:21.989
And something happened.

00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.974
I realized Sister Sam was right.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:28.648
I did get depressed.

00:08:30.203 --> 00:08:31.956
I was in my wheelchair.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.833
I had no feeling from the waist down,

00:08:33.857 --> 00:08:35.310
attached to a catheter bottle.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:36.484
I couldn't walk.

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:39.240
I'd lost so much weight in hospital,

00:08:39.264 --> 00:08:41.836
I now weighed about 80 pounds.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.146
And I wanted to give up.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.242
All I wanted to do was put my running
shoes on and run out the door.

00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:52.425
I wanted my old life back.
I wanted my body back.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.851
And I can remember
Mom sitting on the end of my bed

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:57.857
and saying, "I wonder if life
will ever be good again."

00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:00.771
And I thought, "How could it?

00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:05.086
Because I've lost
everything that I valued,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.219
everything that I'd worked towards.

00:09:07.243 --> 00:09:08.393
Gone."

00:09:10.253 --> 00:09:14.069
And the question I asked was,
"Why me? Why me?"

00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:16.697
And then I remembered

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.012
my friends that were still
in the spinal ward,

00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:22.346
particularly Maria.

00:09:23.147 --> 00:09:24.608
Maria was in a car accident,

00:09:24.632 --> 00:09:26.557
and she woke up on her 16th birthday

00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.676
to the news that she was
a complete quadriplegic,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.969
had no movement from the neck down,

00:09:31.993 --> 00:09:34.991
had damage to her vocal chords,
and she couldn't talk.

00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:38.360
They told me, "We're going
to move you next to her

00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:40.420
because we think it will be good for her."

00:09:41.453 --> 00:09:45.186
I was worried. I didn't know
how I'd react to being next to her.

00:09:45.963 --> 00:09:49.829
I knew it would be challenging,
but it was actually a blessing,

00:09:49.853 --> 00:09:54.672
because Maria always smiled.

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:59.432
She was always happy,
and even when she began to talk again,

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:04.688
albeit difficult to understand,
she never complained, not once.

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:10.460
And I wondered how had she ever
found that level of acceptance.

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:15.285
And I realized
that this wasn't just my life;

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:17.094
it was life itself.

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:22.079
I realized that this wasn't just my pain;
it was everybody's pain.

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:25.420
And then I knew, just like before,

00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:29.222
that I had a choice:
I could keep fighting this,

00:10:30.204 --> 00:10:34.807
or I could let go
and accept not only my body,

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.225
but the circumstances of my life.

00:10:38.315 --> 00:10:40.980
And then I stopped asking, "Why me?"

00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:44.065
And I started to ask, "Why not me?"

00:10:45.192 --> 00:10:47.484
And then I thought to myself,

00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:52.139
maybe being at rock bottom
is actually the perfect place to start.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.675
I had never before thought of myself
as a creative person.

00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:02.860
I was an athlete; my body was a machine.

00:11:03.773 --> 00:11:08.195
But now I was about to embark
on the most creative project

00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:10.203
that any of us could ever do:

00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:12.062
that of rebuilding a life.

00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:16.687
And even though I had absolutely
no idea what I was going to do,

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.951
in that uncertainty came
a sense of freedom.

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.158
I was no longer tied to a set path.

00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:28.764
I was free to explore
life's infinite possibilities.

00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:33.648
And that realization
was about to change my life.

00:11:35.855 --> 00:11:40.444
Sitting at home in my wheelchair
and my plaster body cast,

00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:42.611
an airplane flew overhead.

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:47.413
I looked up, and I thought
to myself, "That's it!

00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:50.881
If I can't walk,
then I might as well fly."

00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:51.920
(Laughter)

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:54.573
I said, "Mom, I'm going
to learn how to fly."

00:11:54.597 --> 00:11:56.351
She said, "That's nice, dear."

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:58.450
(Laughter)

00:11:58.474 --> 00:12:00.845
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages."

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:03.602
She passed me the phone book,
I rang up the flying school,

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:06.447
I said I'd like to make a booking
to come out for a flight.

00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:08.787
They said, "When do you want to come out?"

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:12.381
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend
to drive me because I can't drive.

00:12:12.405 --> 00:12:14.799
Sort of can't walk, either.
Is that a problem?"

00:12:14.823 --> 00:12:16.473
I made a booking, and weeks later,

00:12:16.497 --> 00:12:19.270
my friend Chris and my mom
drove me out to the airport,

00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:21.692
all 80 pounds of me covered
in a plaster body cast

00:12:21.716 --> 00:12:23.150
in a baggy pair of overalls.

00:12:23.174 --> 00:12:24.272
(Laughter)

00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:27.052
I can tell you, I did not
look like the ideal candidate

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:28.442
to get a pilot's license.

00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.060
(Laughter)

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:32.537
I'm holding on to the counter
because I can't stand.

00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.625
I said, "Hi, I'm here
for a flying lesson."

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:38.283
They took one look and ran
out the back to draw short straws.

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:41.250
"You get her." "No, no, you take her."

00:12:41.274 --> 00:12:44.469
Finally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm going to take you flying."

00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:45.667
I go, "Great!"

00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:47.386
They get me out on the tarmac,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.878
and there was this red, white and blue
airplane -- it was beautiful.

00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:54.688
They had to slide me up on the wing
to put me in the cockpit.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:57.471
They sat me down. There are buttons
and dials everywhere.

00:12:57.495 --> 00:13:01.100
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know
what all these buttons and dials do?"

00:13:01.124 --> 00:13:03.775
Andrew got in the front,
started the plane, and said,

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.777
"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:08.547
That's when you use your feet
to control the rudder pedals

00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:10.418
to control the airplane on the ground.

00:13:10.442 --> 00:13:12.317
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:13.524
He went, "Oh."

00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:16.350
I said, "But I can use
my hands," and he said, "OK."

00:13:16.374 --> 00:13:19.307
So he got over to the runway,
and he applied the power.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.551
And as we took off down the runway,

00:13:21.575 --> 00:13:25.275
and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac,
and we became airborne,

00:13:26.322 --> 00:13:29.949
I had the most incredible
sense of freedom.

00:13:30.925 --> 00:13:32.472
And Andrew said to me,

00:13:33.497 --> 00:13:35.353
as we got over the training area,

00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:38.148
"You see that mountain over there?"

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.053
And I said, "Yeah."

00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:44.554
And he said, "Well, you take the controls,
and you fly towards that mountain."

00:13:44.578 --> 00:13:47.037
And as I looked up, I realized

00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:50.502
that he was pointing
towards the Blue Mountains,

00:13:50.526 --> 00:13:52.229
where the journey had begun.

00:13:53.756 --> 00:13:55.335
And I took the controls,

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.602
and I was flying.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:01.176
And I was a long, long way
from that spinal ward.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.791
I knew right then
that I was going to be a pilot.

00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:07.605
Didn't know how on Earth
I'd ever pass a medical.

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:08.739
(Laughter)

00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:12.018
But I'd worry about that later,
because right now, I had a dream.

00:14:12.042 --> 00:14:15.416
So I went home, I got a training
diary out, and I had a plan.

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:19.063
And I practiced my walking
as much as I could,

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:21.783
and I went from the point
of two people holding me up ...

00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.394
to one person holding me up ...

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.698
to the point where I could
walk around the furniture

00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:29.457
as long as it wasn't too far apart.

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:31.218
And then I made great progression,

00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:33.528
to the point where I could walk
around the house,

00:14:33.552 --> 00:14:35.242
holding onto the walls, like this.

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.916
And Mom said she was forever following me,

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.439
wiping off my fingerprints.

00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:41.812
(Laughter)

00:14:41.836 --> 00:14:43.976
But at least she always knew where I was.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.078
(Laughter)

00:14:46.102 --> 00:14:48.575
So while the doctors continued to operate

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:50.651
and put my body back together again,

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:52.496
I went on with my theory study.

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:57.655
And then eventually, amazingly,
I passed my pilot's medical,

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.887
and that was my green light to fly.

00:14:59.911 --> 00:15:02.729
And I spent every moment I could
out at that flying school,

00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:04.307
way out of my comfort zone,

00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:07.402
all these young guys that wanted
to be Qantas pilots, you know,

00:15:07.426 --> 00:15:10.355
and little old hop-along me
in first my plaster cast,

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:12.854
and then my steel brace,
my baggy overalls,

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:16.454
my bag of medication
and catheters and my limp.

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:18.092
They use to look at me and think,

00:15:18.116 --> 00:15:21.394
"Oh, who is she kidding?
She's never going to be able to do this."

00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:23.202
And sometimes I thought that, too.

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:24.829
But that didn't matter,

00:15:24.853 --> 00:15:27.635
because now there was something
inside that burned

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.675
that far outweighed my injuries.

00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:33.981
And little goals
kept me going along the way,

00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:36.879
and eventually I got
my private pilot's license.

00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:41.667
Then I learned to navigate,
and I flew my friends around Australia.

00:15:42.612 --> 00:15:45.563
And then I learned to fly
an airplane with two engines

00:15:45.587 --> 00:15:47.389
and I got my twin-engine rating.

00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:51.316
And then I learned to fly in bad weather
as well as fine weather,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.139
and got my instrument rating.

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:56.496
And then I got
my commercial pilot's license.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.748
And then I got my instructor rating.

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:02.418
And then I found myself
back at that same school

00:16:02.442 --> 00:16:04.910
where I'd gone for that very first flight,

00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:06.814
teaching other people how to fly ...

00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:12.052
just under 18 months
after I'd left the spinal ward.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:19.076
(Applause)

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.894
(Applause ends)

00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:25.921
And then I thought, "Why stop there?

00:16:25.945 --> 00:16:27.967
Why not learn to fly upside down?"

00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:29.093
(Laughter)

00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:31.903
And I did, and I learned
to fly upside down

00:16:31.927 --> 00:16:34.252
and became an aerobatics
flying instructor.

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:36.124
(Laughter)

00:16:36.148 --> 00:16:39.131
And Mom and Dad? Never been up.

00:16:39.155 --> 00:16:42.623
(Laughter)

00:16:42.647 --> 00:16:47.876
But then I knew for certain
that although my body might be limited,

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.662
it was my spirit that was unstoppable.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.019
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,

00:16:57.003 --> 00:16:59.002
"When you let go of what you are,

00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:01.511
you become what you might be."

00:17:02.457 --> 00:17:07.733
I now know that it wasn't until I let go
of who I thought I was

00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:10.841
that I was able to create
a completely new life.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.978
It wasn't until I let go
of the life I thought I should have ...

00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:20.126
that I was able to embrace
the life that was waiting for me.

00:17:21.532 --> 00:17:24.181
I now know that my real strength

00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:26.267
never came from my body.

00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:32.500
And although my physical capabilities
have changed dramatically,

00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:35.563
who I am is unchanged.

00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:40.527
The pilot light inside of me
was still alight,

00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:43.431
just as it is in each and every one of us.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.322
I know that I'm not my body.

00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:50.897
And I also know that you're not yours.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:56.226
And then it no longer matters
what you look like,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.721
where you come from,
or what you do for a living.

00:18:00.657 --> 00:18:06.341
All that matters is that we continue
to fan the flame of humanity

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:10.295
by living our lives
as the ultimate creative expression

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.392
of who we really are,

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:15.937
because we are all connected

00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:19.486
by millions and millions of straws.

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:24.092
And it's time to join those up

00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:25.435
and to hang on.

00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:29.399
And if we are to move
towards our collective bliss ...

00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:32.971
it's time we shed our focus
on the physical

00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:36.357
and instead embrace
the virtues of the heart.

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:39.109
So raise your straws if you'll join me.

00:18:39.964 --> 00:18:41.114
(Applause)

00:18:41.138 --> 00:18:42.299
Thank you.

00:18:42.323 --> 00:18:47.370
(Applause)

00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:48.720
Thank you.

00:18:48.744 --> 00:18:52.490
(Applause)
