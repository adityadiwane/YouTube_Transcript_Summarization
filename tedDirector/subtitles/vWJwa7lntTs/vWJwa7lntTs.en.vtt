00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:16.956
Two months ago, my kids and I
huddled around a cell phone

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.276
watching the live stream
of the Game Awards,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.196
one of the video game
industry's biggest nights.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.876
They announced the nominees
for the Game for Impact,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.956
an award that's given
to a thought-provoking video game

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.756
with a profound prosocial
message or meaning.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.476
They opened the envelope

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.716
and they read the title of our video game.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.116
An award ...

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.956
for impact.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.676
It was almost funny, actually,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.356
because I always thought
that winning an award like that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.036
would have this huge impact on my life,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.820
but I found that the opposite is true.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.076
The big nights,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.196
the accomplishments --

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.796
they fade.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.236
But the hardest nights of my life
have stuck with me,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.756
impacting who I am

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.500
and what I do.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.380
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed
with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.236
And before that year was finished,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.796
doctors sat my husband and I down

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.076
and let us know
that his tumor had returned

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.820
despite the most aggressive chemotherapy
and radiation that they could offer him.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.796
On that terrible night,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.916
after learning that Joel
had perhaps four months to live,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.796
I cuddled up with
my two older sons in bed --

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.356
they were five and three at the time --

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.476
and I never really knew
how much they understood,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.196
so I started telling them a bedtime story.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.076
I told them about this
very brave knight named Joel

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.740
and his adventure fighting
a terrible dragon called cancer.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.596
Every night, I told them
more of the story,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.636
but I never let the story end.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.796
I was just building up a context
that they could understand

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.076
and hoping that our prayers
would be answered

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.596
and I would never
have to tell them that that knight,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.916
who had fought so bravely,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.476
was done fighting

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.780
and could rest now, forever.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.756
Fortunately, I never did have to
finish that bedtime story.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.956
My children outgrew it.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.076
Joel responded better than anyone expected
to palliative treatment,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.756
and so instead of months,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.060
we spent years learning how to love
our dying child with all of our hearts.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.436
Learning to recognize
that shameful feeling

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.356
of holding back just a little love

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.236
to try to spare ourselves
just a little pain

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.820
somewhere further down the road.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.036
We pushed past that self-preservation

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.980
because Joel was worth loving
even if that love could crush us.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.460
And that lesson of intense
vulnerability has changed me ...

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.820
more than any award ever could.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.556
We started living like Joel could live,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.820
and we began developing a video game
called "That Dragon, Cancer."

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.860
It was the story of Joel.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.076
It was the story of hope
in the shadow of death.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.620
It was the story of faith

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.916
and doubt,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.060
and the realization that a wrestle
with doubt is a part of faith --

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.500
maybe the biggest part of it.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.836
It was a story that began as a miracle

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.300
and ended as a memorial.

[That Dragon, Cancer]

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.220
(Music)

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.276
When you play "That Dragon, Cancer,"

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.276
you're transformed
into a witness of Joel's life,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.476
exploring an emotional landscape,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.036
clicking to discover more of what
we as a family felt and experienced.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.596
It feels a little bit
like analyzing interactive poetry

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.956
because every game mechanic is a metaphor,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.356
and so the more the player asks themselves

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.316
what we as designers
were trying to express and why,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.700
the richer the experience becomes.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.236
We took that vulnerability
that Joel taught us,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.820
and we encoded the game with it.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.916
Players expect their video games
to offer them branching narrative

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.476
so that every decision
that they make feels important

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.196
and can change the outcome of the game.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.996
We subverted that principle
of game design,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.396
collapsing the choices in on the player

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.196
so that they discover for themselves

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.420
that there is nothing that they can do
that will change the outcome for Joel.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.876
And they feel that discovery
as deeply and desperately as we felt it

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.076
on nights when we held Joel
in our arms praying for hours,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.540
stubbornly holding out hope for a grace
that we could not create for ourselves.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.140
We'd all prefer to win,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.340
but when you discover that you can't win,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.020
what do you value instead?

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.636
I never planned to write video games,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.196
but these moments
that really change our lives,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.340
they often come as the result
of our hardship -- and not our glory.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.436
When we thought that Joel could live,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.596
I left the game designing to my husband.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.676
I chimed in here and there

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.676
with a scene or two and some suggestions.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.340
But after the night that Joel died,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.716
the passion,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.916
the possibility of sharing Joel's life
through our video game --

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.076
it was something that I couldn't resist.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.436
I started writing more,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.876
I sat in on our team's design meetings,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.996
I added more ideas
and I helped direct scenes.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.916
And I discovered that creating
a video game is telling a story,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.676
but with an entirely new vocabulary.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.236
All the same elements of imagination
and symbolism are there,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.876
but they're just partnered
with player agency

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.900
and system responsiveness.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.556
It's challenging work.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.596
I have to think
in a totally new way to do it,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.276
but I love it.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.900
And I wouldn't have known
that without Joel.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.396
Maybe you're a little surprised

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.500
by our choice to share our story
of terminal cancer through a video game.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.516
Perhaps you're even thinking
like so many people before you:

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.860
cancer is not a game.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.276
Well, tell that
to any pediatric cancer parent

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.236
that's ever taken an exam glove
and blown it up into a balloon,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.996
or transformed a syringe
into a rocket ship,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.156
or let their child ride their IV pole
through the hospital halls

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.860
like it was a race car.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.796
Because when you have children,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.660
everything is a game.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.396
And when your young child
experiences something traumatic,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.476
you work even harder to make sure
that their life feels like a game

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.380
because children naturally
explore their worlds through play.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.076
While cancer can steal
many things from a family,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.700
it shouldn't steal play.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.276
If you're listening to me
and you're trying to imagine this family

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.516
that revolves entirely
around a dying child,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.556
and you can't imagine joy
as part of that picture,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.636
then we were right
to share our story with you,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.316
because that season of our life was hard.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.116
Unspeakably hard at times,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.220
but it was also pure hope,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.436
deep love

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.340
and joy like I have never
experienced since.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.676
Our video game was our attempt
to share that world

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.916
with people who hadn't
experienced it before,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.740
because we never could imagine
that world until it became ours.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.060
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.436
It will never be a blockbuster.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.196
People have to prepare themselves
to invest emotionally

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.740
in a story that they know
will break their hearts.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.036
But when our hearts break,

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.380
they heal a little differently.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.715
My broken heart has been healing
with a new and a deeper compassion --

00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:49.676
a desire to sit with people in their pain,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.715
to hear their stories
and try to help tell them

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.700
so that they know that they're seen.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.756
On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer"
won the Game for Impact Award,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.196
we cheered,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.396
we smiled and we talked about Joel

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.676
and the impact he had on our life --

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.796
on all of those hard and hopeful nights
that we shared with him

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.276
when he changed our hearts

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:19.180
and taught us so much more
about life and love and faith and purpose.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:26.140
That award will never mean as much to me
as even a single photograph of my son,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.676
but it does represent all of the people
who his life has impacted,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.796
people I'll never meet.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.180
They write me emails sometimes.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.156
They tell me that they miss Joel,
even though they never met him.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.820
They describe the tears
that they've shed for my son,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.556
and it makes my burden of grief
just a little bit lighter

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.676
knowing that it's shared
with a 10-year-old

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.716
watching a YouTube playthrough,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.956
or a doctor playing on his airplane
with a smartphone,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.420
or a professor introducing Joel
to her first-year philosophy students.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.220
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.036
But that feels just right to me,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.636
because the hardest moments of our lives

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.140
change us more than any goal
we could ever accomplish.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.796
Tragedy has shifted my heart

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.860
more than any dream
I could ever see come true.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.156
Thank you.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.418
(Applause)
