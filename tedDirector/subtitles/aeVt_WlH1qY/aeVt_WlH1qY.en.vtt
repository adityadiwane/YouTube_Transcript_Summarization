00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.365
I'm going to talk about the power of a word:

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:22.421
jihad.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:26.777
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims,

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.801
jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:35.487
It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:37.777
temptation, lust, greed.

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:41.406
It is a struggle to try and live a life

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:48.104
that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:53.574
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:59.432
to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:03.178
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:08.160
and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.546
And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:13.365
Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.887
their daughters as much as their sons, in the same way

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:19.709
that, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.677
and Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,

00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:29.149
which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.914
But there have always been, in Islam, a small group,

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.383
a minority, who believe that jihad

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:37.357
is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:43.733
against forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.854
And some of these people believe that in that struggle,

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:50.453
it is sometimes okay to take up arms.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:53.160
And so the thousands of young Muslim men

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.077
who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:59.805
to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,

00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:02.533
in their minds they were fighting a jihad,

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.949
they were doing jihad,

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:07.741
and they named themselves the Mujahideen,

00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:12.525
which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:15.365
And we forget this now, but back then

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:19.323
the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:21.821
We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:25.577
the good fight to the ungodly communists.

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:27.622
America gave them weapons, gave them money,

00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:30.621
gave them support, encouragement.

00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:32.947
But within that group, a tiny, smaller group,

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:36.829
a minority within a minority within a minority,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.814
were coming up with a new and dangerous

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:42.633
conception of jihad,

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:47.942
and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,

00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:49.442
and he refined the idea.

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:54.080
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.590
primarily targeted at the far enemy,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.989
at the crusaders from the West, against America.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.828
And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.508
were so horrendous, so monstrous,

00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:08.483
and had such great impact,

00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:12.687
that his definition was the one that stuck,

00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:13.966
not just here in the West.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:17.825
We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.395
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:27.605
were calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:30.862
But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,

00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:35.533
his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:38.885
A year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.825
of a very small mosque, an old man.

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:44.790
Fifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.757
after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that

00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:52.189
would inspire her to live a spiritual life.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.869
But he told me that after 9/11,

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.549
he began to have second thoughts.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.495
He worried that if he called her by that name,

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:02.020
especially outdoors, outside in public,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.938
he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:10.401
On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons

00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:14.818
trying to reclaim the meaning of the word,

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:18.557
but his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:20.785
they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures

00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:26.527
of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.553
They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.514
and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:36.810
that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.082
He was wrong. Some people were paying attention,

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:41.988
but for the wrong reasons.

00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:44.762
The United States, at this point, was putting pressure

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:47.201
on all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,

00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:51.538
to stamp out extremism in their societies,

00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:55.005
and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:57.876
of the Tunisian intelligence service.

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.332
They had never paid him any attention before --

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.557
old man, small mosque --

00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:04.767
but now they began to pay visits,

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:06.429
and sometimes they would drag him in for questions,

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:07.777
and always the same question:

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:11.988
"Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?

00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:16.587
Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.652
Do you hate Americans?

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:22.772
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"

00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:24.787
So to the Tunisian intelligence agency,

00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:27.620
and organizations like it all over the Arab world,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.084
jihad equaled extremism,

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:36.018
Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.

00:05:36.018 --> 00:05:39.807
That was the power of that word that he was able to do.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:45.529
And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.444
He told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,

00:05:48.444 --> 00:05:51.516
in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:55.314
that he took this word, this beautiful idea.

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:59.780
He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.660
and debased it and corrupted it

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.020
and turned it into something it was never meant to be,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.697
and then persuaded all of us that it always was

00:06:11.697 --> 00:06:14.339
a global jihad.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.882
But the good news is

00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:23.661
that the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.

00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:26.219
It was dying well before he did,

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.528
and now it's on its last legs.

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:30.867
Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:35.419
that there is very little interest among Muslims

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.929
in a global holy war against the West,

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:41.243
against the far enemy.

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:45.453
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.

00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:48.148
The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps —

00:06:48.148 --> 00:06:50.811
the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.619
The wealthy fanatics who were previously

00:06:53.619 --> 00:07:00.235
sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.

00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:01.668
What does that mean for us in the West?

00:07:01.668 --> 00:07:05.387
Does it mean we can break out the champagne,

00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:10.615
wash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?

00:07:10.615 --> 00:07:15.699
No. Disengagement is not an option,

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:22.195
because if you let local jihad survive,

00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:24.979
it becomes international jihad.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.660
And so there's now a lot of different

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.196
violent jihads all over the world.

00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:32.483
In Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,

00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:37.634
in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:43.032
to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:44.548
They use his rhetoric.

00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:49.715
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:53.873
So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.502
there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,

00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:58.152
there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.

00:07:58.152 --> 00:08:00.239
There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram,

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:06.352
in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.286
But if you look closely,

00:08:08.286 --> 00:08:11.087
they're not fighting a global jihad.

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:15.173
They're fighting battles over much narrower issues.

00:08:15.173 --> 00:08:19.542
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:20.734
or it's a power struggle.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.574
More often than not, it's a power struggle

00:08:22.574 --> 00:08:26.170
in one country, or even a small region within one country.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.134
Occasionally they will go across a border,

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:35.413
from Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,

00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:37.293
from Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting

00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:42.334
a global jihad against some far enemy.

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.421
But that doesn't mean

00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:47.748
that we can relax.

00:08:47.748 --> 00:08:49.999
I was in Yemen recently, where -- it's the home

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.310
of the last al Qaeda franchise

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.422
that still aspires to attack America, attack the West.

00:08:57.422 --> 00:08:59.645
It's old school al Qaeda.

00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:00.832
You may remember these guys.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.513
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,

00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:06.462
and they were using the Internet to try and instigate

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.302
violence among American Muslims.

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:10.642
But they have been distracted recently.

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:13.349
Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,

00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:16.106
and ran it, Taliban-style.

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:18.905
And then the Yemeni military got its act together,

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:22.222
and ordinary people rose up against these guys

00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:25.508
and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,

00:09:25.508 --> 00:09:29.709
most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:33.750
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.246
that, just like all politics, all jihad is local.

00:09:37.246 --> 00:09:41.718
But that's still not reason for us to disengage,

00:09:41.718 --> 00:09:45.463
because we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.

00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:49.262
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,

00:09:49.262 --> 00:09:51.958
we disengaged.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:59.047
And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,

00:09:59.047 --> 00:10:01.827
the Taliban had taken over in Kabul,

00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:05.741
and we said, "Local jihad, not our problem."

00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:08.467
And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:11.003
to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.

00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:17.284
Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.891
The good news is that it doesn't have to be.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:23.064
We know how to fight it now.

00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:25.835
We have the tools. We have the knowhow,

00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:27.422
and we can take the lessons we've learned

00:10:27.422 --> 00:10:31.323
from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,

00:10:31.323 --> 00:10:34.803
and apply those to local jihad.

00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:39.595
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.530
SEAL Team Six.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.992
Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?

00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:49.355
Who ended the global jihad?

00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:52.726
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.

00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:57.004
Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.

00:10:57.004 --> 00:10:59.395
He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.

00:10:59.395 --> 00:11:03.547
In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.

00:11:03.547 --> 00:11:06.419
He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:10.603
the Muslim world with horror and revulsion,

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:13.796
and what that meant was that his idea of jihad

00:11:13.796 --> 00:11:15.375
could never become mainstream.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:19.254
He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes

00:11:19.254 --> 00:11:23.315
of his own community.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:28.423
9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.

00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:33.241
Who killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.

00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:36.434
He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq

00:11:36.434 --> 00:11:39.755
who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack

00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:46.227
not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.

00:11:46.227 --> 00:11:50.195
Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam

00:11:50.195 --> 00:11:53.038
against the Western crusaders

00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:58.712
was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.

00:11:58.712 --> 00:12:02.115
Who killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.

00:12:02.115 --> 00:12:04.823
Who killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:09.883
Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,

00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:12.900
because they circumvented the old, state-owned

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.395
television stations in a lot of these countries

00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:19.387
which were designed to keep information from people.

00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:22.835
Al Jazeera brought information to them, showed them

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:26.232
what was being said and done in the name of their religion,

00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:31.505
exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,

00:12:31.505 --> 00:12:33.411
and allowed them, gave them the information

00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:37.904
that allowed them to come to their own conclusions.

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:41.240
Who killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.704
because it showed a way for young Muslims

00:12:44.704 --> 00:12:48.552
to bring about change

00:12:48.552 --> 00:12:50.337
in a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:54.000
limited imagination, could never have conceived.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.398
Who defeated the global jihad? The American military did,

00:12:57.398 --> 00:12:59.880
the American soldiers did, with their allies,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.896
fighting in faraway battlefields.

00:13:04.896 --> 00:13:10.072
And perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:13.129
So all these factors, and many more besides,

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:16.296
we don't even fully understand some of them yet,

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.129
these came together

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:22.920
to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.768
the global jihad, you needed this group effort.

00:13:26.768 --> 00:13:28.848
Now, not all of these things will work in local jihad.

00:13:28.848 --> 00:13:31.770
The American military is not going to march into Nigeria

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.379
to take on Boko Haram,

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.316
and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:40.850
into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.404
But many of these other factors that were in play

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:50.278
are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.

00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:53.299
We don't have to reinvent the wheel.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:56.770
The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.346
than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:03.962
We don't have to go back to that.

00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:07.996
Satellite television and the Internet are informing

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:12.383
and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.

00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:15.008
And the Arab Spring has produced governments,

00:14:15.008 --> 00:14:18.112
many of them Islamist governments,

00:14:18.112 --> 00:14:21.077
who know that, for their own self-preservation,

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:26.987
they need to take on the extremists in their midsts.

00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:29.842
We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,

00:14:29.842 --> 00:14:35.088
because they haven't really come to this place before.

00:14:35.088 --> 00:14:38.842
The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need

00:14:38.842 --> 00:14:41.641
we already have, and we are very good at giving:

00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:45.564
economic assistance, not just money, but expertise,

00:14:45.564 --> 00:14:48.201
technology, knowhow,

00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:52.239
private investment, fair terms of trade,

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:56.449
medicine, education, technical support for training

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:59.540
for their police forces to become more effective,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.407
for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.

00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:05.821
We've got plenty of these things.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.114
Some of the other things that they need

00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:11.569
we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.

00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:16.766
Time, patience, subtlety, understanding --

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:18.808
these are harder to give.

00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:21.185
I live in New York now. Just this week,

00:15:21.185 --> 00:15:23.723
posters have gone up in subway stations in New York

00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:29.449
that describe jihad as savage.

00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:33.802
But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:37.034
I have never been as optimistic as I am today

00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:40.697
that the gap between the Muslim world and the West

00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:43.321
is narrowing fast,

00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:44.994
and one of the many reasons for my optimism

00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:48.306
is that, because I know there are millions,

00:15:48.306 --> 00:15:52.129
hundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:58.871
in Tunis, who are reclaiming this word

00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:04.219
and restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.

00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:06.835
Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:11.216
His definition of jihad can now be expunged.

00:16:11.216 --> 00:16:15.757
To that jihad we can say, "Goodbye. Good riddance."

00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:22.291
To the real jihad we can say, "Welcome back. Good luck."

00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:25.923
Thank you. (Applause)
