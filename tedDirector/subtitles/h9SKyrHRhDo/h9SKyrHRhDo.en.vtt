00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:17.709
The world's largest and most devastating
environmental and industrial project

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.574
is situated in the heart of the largest
and most intact forest in the world,

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:23.402
Canada's boreal forest.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:27.849
It stretches right across
Northern Canada, in Labrador,

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:31.046
it's home to the largest remaining
wild caribou herd in the world:

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.541
the George River caribou herd,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.734
numbering approximately 400,000 animals.

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:37.616
Unfortunately, when I was there,
I couldn't find one of them,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.518
but you have the antlers as proof.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.327
All across the boreal,

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.745
we're blessed with this incredible
abundance of wetlands.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.769
Wetlands, globally, are one
of the most endangered ecosystems.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.008
They're absolutely critical ecosystems,

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:54.613
they clean air, they clean water,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.706
they sequester large amounts
of greenhouse gases,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.131
and they're home
to a huge diversity of species.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:03.512
In the boreal, they are also the home

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:07.887
where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird
species found in North America

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:10.468
migrate north to breed
and raise their young.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:17.580
In Ontario, the boreal marches down south
to the north shore of Lake Superior.

00:01:18.032 --> 00:01:21.545
And these incredibly
beautiful boreal forests

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.514
were the inspiration for some of the most
famous art in Canadian history,

00:01:25.538 --> 00:01:29.868
the Group of Seven
were very inspired by this landscape,

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:35.250
and so the boreal is not just a really key
part of our natural heritage,

00:01:35.274 --> 00:01:38.033
but also an important part
of our cultural heritage.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:42.514
In Manitoba, this is an image
from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,

00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:47.293
and this is the home of the newly
designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.

00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.549
In Saskatchewan,
as across all of the boreal,

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:53.986
home to some of our most famous rivers,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.066
an incredible network of rivers and lakes
that every school-age child learns about,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.883
the Peace, the Athabasca,
the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.850
and these networks
were the historical routes

00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:09.098
for the voyageur and the coureur de bois,

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:12.429
the first non-aboriginal
explorers of Northern Canada

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:15.212
that, taking from
the First Nations people,

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.616
used canoes and paddled to explore

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.350
for a trade route,
a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:25.585
In the North, the boreal
is bordered by the tundra,

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.632
and just below that, in Yukon,

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:32.134
we have this incredible valley,
the Tombstone Valley.

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:36.844
And the Tombstone Valley is home
to the Porcupine caribou herd.

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:39.586
Now you've probably heard
about the Porcupine caribou herd

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.162
in the context of its breeding ground
in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.408
Well, the wintering ground
is also critical

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.033
and it also is not protected,

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:53.188
and is potentially, could be potentially,
exploited for gas and mineral rights.

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.309
The western border of the boreal
in British Columbia

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.950
is marked by the Coast Mountains,

00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:00.945
and on the other side of those mountains

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.797
is the greatest remaining
temperate rainforest in the world,

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.163
the Great Bear Rainforest,

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:08.047
and we'll discuss that in a few minutes
in a bit more detail.

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:09.501
All across the boreal,

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:14.519
it's home for a huge incredible range
of indigenous peoples,

00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:17.129
and a rich and varied culture.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.122
And I think that one of the reasons

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:23.620
why so many of these groups have
retained a link to the past,

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:25.656
know their native languages,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.018
the songs, the dances, the traditions,

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.553
I think part of that reason
is because of the remoteness,

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:32.879
the span and the wilderness

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:36.567
of this almost 95 percent
intact ecosystem.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:38.643
And I think particularly now,

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:41.799
as we see ourselves in a time
of environmental crisis,

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:43.736
we can learn so much from these people

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.985
who have lived so sustainably
in this ecosystem

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.823
for over 10,000 years.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.533
In the heart of this ecosystem
is the very antithesis

00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:55.036
of all of these values
that we've been talking about,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.198
and I think these
are some of the core values

00:03:57.222 --> 00:03:58.900
that make us proud to be Canadians.

00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:00.740
This is the Alberta tar sands,

00:04:00.764 --> 00:04:05.366
the largest oil reserves on the planet
outside of Saudi Arabia.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.286
Trapped underneath the boreal forest
and wetlands of northern Alberta

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.100
are these vast reserves
of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.

00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:16.217
And the mining
and the exploitation of that

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:20.522
is creating devastation on a scale
that the planet has never seen before.

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:26.246
I want to try to convey
some sort of a sense of the size of this.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.836
If you look at that truck there,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.276
it is the largest truck
of its kind on the planet.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.046
It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.070
and its dimensions are 45 feet long
by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:42.690
If I stand beside that truck,

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:46.125
my head comes to around the bottom
of the yellow part of that hubcap.

00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:48.685
Within the dimensions of that truck,

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:52.974
you could build a 3,000-square-foot
two-story home quite easily.

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:54.203
I did the math.

00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:59.407
So instead of thinking of that as a truck,
think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.

00:04:59.802 --> 00:05:01.698
That's not a bad size home.

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:05.079
And line those trucks / homes
back and forth

00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:09.348
across there from the bottom
all the way to the top.

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:15.070
And then think of how large
that very small section of one mine is.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.246
Now, you can apply that same kind
of thinking here as well.

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:22.201
Now, here you see --
of course, as you go further on,

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:23.872
these trucks become like a pixel.

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:27.607
Again, imagine those
all back and forth there.

00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:30.041
How large is that one portion of a mine?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.126
That would be a huge,
vast metropolitan area,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.502
probably much larger
than the city of Victoria.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:42.352
And this is just one of a number of mines,

00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.560
10 mines so far right now.

00:05:44.584 --> 00:05:47.190
This is one section of one mining complex,

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:51.053
and there are about another 40 or 50
in the approval process.

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:53.837
No tar sands mine has actually
ever been denied approval,

00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:55.866
so it is essentially a rubber stamp.

00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:00.439
The other method of extraction
is what's called the in situ.

00:06:00.463 --> 00:06:02.435
And here, massive amounts of water

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:05.466
are superheated and pumped
through the ground,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.578
through these vasts networks of pipelines,

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:11.292
seismic lines, drill paths,
compressor stations.

00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:15.459
And even though this looks
maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,

00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:17.660
it's even more damaging in some ways.

00:06:17.684 --> 00:06:23.059
It impacts and fragments
a larger part of the wilderness,

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.545
where there is 90 percent
reduction of key species,

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.886
like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.418
and it consumes
even more energy, more water,

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.995
and produces at least
as much greenhouse gas.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:40.011
So these in situ developments are at least
as ecologically damaging as the mines.

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.358
The oil produced from either method

00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:48.934
produces more greenhouse gas
emissions than any other oil.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.222
This is one of the reasons
why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.

00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:53.949
It's also one of the reasons

00:06:53.973 --> 00:06:59.169
why it is the largest and fastest-growing
single source of carbon in Canada,

00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:04.115
and it is also a reason
why Canada is now number three

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.095
in terms of producing carbon per person.

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:12.975
The tailings ponds are the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.872
Oil sands -- or rather,
I should say tar sands --

00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:19.181
oil sands is a PR-created term

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:22.264
so that the oil companies
wouldn't be trying to promote something

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:26.291
that sounds like a sticky tar-like
substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.582
So they decided to call it oil sands.

00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:32.928
The tar sands consume more water
than any other oil process,

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.239
three to five barrels of water
are taken, polluted

00:07:36.263 --> 00:07:38.559
and then returned into tailings ponds,

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.765
the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:41.084 --> 00:07:45.164
SemCrude, just one of the licensees,
in just one of their tailings ponds,

00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:49.941
dumps 250,000 tons
of this toxic gunk every single day.

00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:54.732
That's creating the largest toxic
impoundments in the history of the planet.

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:59.720
So far, this is enough toxin to cover
the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.

00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:05.926
And the tailings ponds
range in size up to 9,000 acres.

00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:10.073
That's two-thirds the size
of the entire island of Manhattan.

00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:13.534
That's like from Wall Street
at the southern edge of Manhattan

00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:15.398
up to maybe 120th Street.

00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:20.174
So this is one of the larger
tailings ponds.

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:23.241
This might be, what? I don't know,
half the size of Manhattan.

00:08:23.265 --> 00:08:24.758
And you can see in the context,

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:29.128
it's just a relatively small section
of one of 10 mining complexes

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:32.605
and another 40 to 50
on stream to be approved soon.

00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:36.954
And of course, these tailings ponds --

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:39.533
well, you can't see
many ponds from outer space

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:43.388
and you can see these, so maybe
we should stop calling them ponds --

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:47.216
these massive toxic wastelands are built

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.886
unlined and on the banks
of the Athabasca River.

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:54.375
And the Athabasca River drains downstream
to a range of aboriginal communities.

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:59.285
In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,
are finding toxins in the food chain,

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:01.172
this has been scientifically proven.

00:09:01.719 --> 00:09:03.738
The tar sands toxins
are in the food chain,

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:06.673
and this is causing cancer
rates up to 10 times

00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:08.765
what they are in the rest of Canada.

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:15.025
In spite of that, people have to live,
have to eat this food in order to survive.

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:18.279
The incredibly high price of flying food

00:09:18.303 --> 00:09:20.892
into these remote
Northern aboriginal communities

00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:22.591
and the high rate of unemployment

00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:25.151
makes this an absolute
necessity for survival.

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:29.326
And not that many years ago,
I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,

00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:32.040
and he said, "When you
go out on the river,

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:35.170
do not under any
circumstances eat the fish.

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:36.883
It's carcinogenic."

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:41.938
And yet, on the front porch
of that man's cabin,

00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:43.369
I saw four fish.

00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:45.393
He had to feed his family to survive.

00:09:46.193 --> 00:09:51.678
And as a parent, I just can't imagine
what that does to your soul.

00:09:52.354 --> 00:09:53.924
And that's what we're doing.

00:09:55.893 --> 00:10:00.295
The boreal forest
is also perhaps our best defense

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:02.498
against global warming and climate change.

00:10:03.443 --> 00:10:07.845
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon
than any other terrestrial ecosystem.

00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:11.369
And this is absolutely key.

00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:13.804
So what we're doing is,

00:10:13.828 --> 00:10:18.386
we're taking the most concentrated
greenhouse gas sink --

00:10:19.517 --> 00:10:22.050
twice as much greenhouse
gases are sequestered

00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:25.611
in the boreal per acre
than the tropical rainforests.

00:10:26.088 --> 00:10:28.565
And what we're doing is we're destroying

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:31.287
this carbon sink,
turning it into a carbon bomb.

00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:34.757
And we're replacing that
with the largest industrial project

00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:36.152
in the history of the world,

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:41.679
which is producing the most high-carbon
greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:47.096
And we're doing this on the second largest
oil reserves on the planet.

00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:51.960
This is one of the reasons why Canada,
originally a climate change hero --

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:55.348
we were one of the first
signatories of the Kyoto Accord.

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:57.792
Now we're the country
that has full-time lobbyists

00:10:57.816 --> 00:11:00.027
in the European Union and Washington DC,

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.774
threatening trade wars

00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:07.524
when these countries talk about wanting
to bring in positive legislation

00:11:07.548 --> 00:11:10.559
to limit the import of high-carbon fuels,

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.846
of greenhouse gas emissions,
anything like this,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.384
at international conferences,
whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,

00:11:18.408 --> 00:11:20.904
international conferences
on climate change,

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:24.067
we're the country that gets
the dinosaur award every single day,

00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:27.379
as being the biggest
obstacle to progress on this issue.

00:11:29.317 --> 00:11:31.723
Just 70 miles downstream

00:11:31.747 --> 00:11:35.442
is the world's largest freshwater delta,
the Peace-Athabasca Delta,

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:39.269
the only one at the juncture
of all four migratory flyways.

00:11:39.293 --> 00:11:43.210
This is a globally significant wetland,
perhaps the greatest on the planet.

00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:46.943
Incredible habitat
for half the bird species

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:49.706
you find in North America, migrating here.

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.845
And also the last refuge
for the largest herd of wild bison,

00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:58.812
and also, of course, critical habitat
for another whole range of other species.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.949
But it too is being threatened

00:12:01.973 --> 00:12:05.613
by the massive amount of water
being drawn from the Athabasca,

00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:07.619
which feeds these wetlands,

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.736
and also the incredible toxic burden

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.533
of the largest toxic unlined
impoundments on the planet,

00:12:12.557 --> 00:12:16.540
which are leaching in to the food chain
for all the species downstream.

00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:21.628
So as bad as all that is, things are going
to get much worse -- much, much worse.

00:12:21.652 --> 00:12:24.363
This is the infrastructure
as we see it about now.

00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:27.792
This is what's planned for 2015.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.470
And you can see here
the Keystone Pipeline,

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.395
which would take tar sands raw
down to the Gulf Coast,

00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:40.702
punching a pipeline through
the agricultural heart of North America,

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:43.082
of the United States,

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:48.411
and securing the contract
with the dirtiest fuel in the world

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.379
by consumption of the United States,

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:54.264
and promoting a huge disincentive

00:12:54.288 --> 00:12:57.195
to a sustainable clean-energy
future for America.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.614
Here you see the route
down the Mackenzie valley.

00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:07.339
This would put a pipeline
to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea

00:13:07.363 --> 00:13:12.027
through the heart of the third largest
watershed basin in the world,

00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:14.589
and the only one
which is 95 percent intact.

00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:18.615
And building a pipeline
with an industrial highway

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.127
would change forever
this incredible wilderness,

00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:25.101
which is a true rarity
on the planet today.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:31.551
So the Great Bear Rainforest
is just over the hill there,

00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:34.702
within a few miles,
we go from these dry boreal forests

00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:38.115
of 100-year-old trees,
maybe 10 inches across,

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.576
and soon, we're in the coastal
temperate rainforest,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.176
rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.254
20 feet across, a completely
different ecosystem.

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:50.047
And the Great Bear Rainforest
is generally considered to be

00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:53.425
the largest coastal temperate rainforest
ecosystem in the world.

00:13:54.014 --> 00:13:55.820
Some of the greatest densities

00:13:55.844 --> 00:13:59.028
of some of the most iconic
and threatened species on the planet.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:03.404
And yet there's a proposal,
of course, to build a pipeline

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:08.335
to take huge tankers,
10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,

00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:11.814
through some of the most
difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,

00:14:11.838 --> 00:14:15.154
where only just a few years ago,
a BC ferry ran aground.

00:14:16.202 --> 00:14:18.555
When one of these tar sands tankers,

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:21.941
carrying the dirtiest oil,
10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:24.274
eventually hits a rock and goes down,

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:27.208
we're going to have
one of the worst ecological disasters

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:28.554
this planet has ever seen.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:32.879
And here we have the plan out to 2030.

00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:37.456
What they're proposing is an almost
four-times increase in production,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.755
and that would industrialize
an area the size of Florida.

00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:47.103
In doing so, we'll be removing
a large part of our greatest carbon sink

00:14:47.127 --> 00:14:52.605
and replacing it with the most high
greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.

00:14:53.581 --> 00:14:56.653
The world does not need
any more tar mines.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.637
The world does not need any more pipelines

00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:03.248
to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.

00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:05.833
And the world certainly does not need

00:15:05.857 --> 00:15:08.910
the largest toxic impoundments
to grow and multiply

00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:11.187
and further threaten
the downstream communities.

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.207
And let's face it, we all live downstream

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:15.834
in an era of global warming
and climate change.

00:15:17.043 --> 00:15:19.801
What we need, is we all need to act

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:24.497
to ensure that Canada respects
the massive amounts of freshwater

00:15:24.521 --> 00:15:26.165
that we hold in this country.

00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:29.281
We need to ensure
that these wetlands and forests

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:32.587
that are our best and greatest
and most critical defense

00:15:32.611 --> 00:15:35.073
against global warming are protected,

00:15:35.097 --> 00:15:38.630
and we are not releasing
that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.

00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:44.688
And we need to all gather together
and say no to the tar sands.

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:45.863
And we can do that.

00:15:45.887 --> 00:15:48.770
there is a huge network
all over the world,

00:15:48.794 --> 00:15:50.517
fighting to stop this project.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.834
And I quite simply think

00:15:52.858 --> 00:15:56.724
that this is not something
that should be decided just in Canada.

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:59.028
Everyone in this room,
everyone across Canada,

00:15:59.052 --> 00:16:01.013
everyone listening to this presentation

00:16:01.037 --> 00:16:03.839
has a role to play
and, I think, a responsibility.

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:09.498
Because what we do here
is going to change our history,

00:16:09.522 --> 00:16:12.215
it's going to color
our possibility to survive,

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.630
and for our children to survive
and have a rich future.

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:19.711
We have an incredible gift in the boreal,

00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:24.843
an incredible opportunity to preserve
our best defense against global warming,

00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:26.724
but we could let that slip away.

00:16:27.715 --> 00:16:31.400
The tar sands could threaten
not just a large section of the boreal.

00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:34.690
It compromises the life and the health

00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:39.238
of some of our most underprivileged
and vulnerable people,

00:16:39.262 --> 00:16:42.375
the aboriginal communities
that have so much to teach us.

00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:45.709
It could destroy the Athabasca Delta,

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:49.574
the largest and possibly greatest
freshwater delta in the planet.

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:53.958
It could destroy
the Great Bear Rainforest,

00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:56.375
the largest temperate
rainforest in the world.

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:58.825
And it could have huge impacts

00:16:58.849 --> 00:17:02.810
on the future of the agricultural
heartland of North America.

00:17:03.337 --> 00:17:06.531
I hope that you will all,
if you've been moved by this presentation,

00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:09.334
join with the growing
international community

00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:12.804
to get Canada to step up
to its responsibilities,

00:17:12.828 --> 00:17:17.214
to convince Canada to go back
to being a climate change champion

00:17:17.238 --> 00:17:18.971
instead of a climate change villain,

00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:20.652
and to say no to the tar sands,

00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:23.345
and yes to a clean energy future for all.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.693
Thank you so much.

00:17:24.717 --> 00:17:27.804
(Applause)
