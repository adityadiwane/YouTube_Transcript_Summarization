00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.516
This will not be a speech

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.807
like any one I have ever given.

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:21.297
I will talk to you today about

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:26.187
the failure of leadership in global politics

00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:29.185
and in our globalizing economy.

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:36.138
And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:38.672
But I will in the end urge you

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:44.115
to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:47.520
in what I see as a global evolution

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330
of democracy.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.585
Failure of leadership.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.346
What is the failure of leadership today?

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.813
And why is our democracy not working?

00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:01.444
Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:05.997
that we have taken you out of the process.

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:08.513
So let me, from my personal experiences,

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:12.742
give you an insight, so that you can step back

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:16.414
and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:18.489
with the challenges of today and why politics

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:22.133
is going down a blind alley.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.630
Let's start from the beginning.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.426
Let's start from democracy.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:30.451
Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,

00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.640
it was a revelation, a discovery,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.157
that we had the potential, together,

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:41.878
to be masters of our own fate,

00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.750
to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.083
and then to design a better life.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:53.269
And democracy was the political innovation

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.771
which protected this freedom,

00:01:55.771 --> 00:02:01.086
because we were liberated from fear

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.739
so that our minds in fact,

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.461
whether they be despots or dogmas,

00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.864
could be the protagonists.

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.853
Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us

00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:16.241
to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:18.988
or of high priests,

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.826
their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:25.436
Well, I first began to understand this

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.558
when I was 14 years old.

00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.668
I used to, to try to avoid homework,

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:34.844
sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:36.544
and their friends debate heatedly.

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:38.922
You see, then Greece was

00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:43.159
under control of a very powerful establishment

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.906
which was strangling the country,

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:47.599
and my father was heading a promising movement

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.419
to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.862
where freedom reigned and where, maybe,

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:56.573
the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:58.869
I used to join him in many of the campaigns,

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.808
and you can see me here next to him.

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.276
I'm the younger one there, to the side.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:06.384
You may not recognize me because

00:03:06.384 --> 00:03:08.612
I used to part my hair differently there.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:10.489
(Laughter)

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.636
So in 1967, elections were coming,

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.480
things were going well in the campaign,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.491
the house was electric.

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.779
We really could sense that there was going to be

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.776
a major progressive change in Greece.

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:29.728
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:32.106
Soldiers storm the door.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.276
They find me up on the top terrace.

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.231
A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.190
puts it to my head, and says,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.542
"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:48.724
My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:52.889
and was summarily taken to prison.

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.625
Well, we survived, but democracy did not.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:59.137
Seven brutal years of dictatorship

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:02.929
which we spent in exile.

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.153
Now, today, our democracies are again

00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:07.432
facing a moment of truth.

00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:09.259
Let me tell you a story.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.543
Sunday evening,

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.662
Brussels, April 2010.

00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:18.215
I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:21.698
I had just been elected prime minister,

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:25.291
but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:28.712
that our deficit was not 6 percent,

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:32.258
as had been officially reported only a few days earlier

00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:35.227
before the elections by the previous government,

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:40.115
but actually 15.6 percent.

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:42.547
But the deficit was only the symptom

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:44.863
of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:48.794
and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:50.039
to tackle these problems,

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.773
whether it was lack of transparency

00:04:52.773 --> 00:04:55.074
and accountability in governance,

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:57.740
or whether it was a clientelistic state

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.293
offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:07.020
abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.452
politics and media captured by special interests.

00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:13.452
But despite our electoral mandate,

00:05:13.452 --> 00:05:16.667
the markets mistrusted us.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.433
Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.340
and we were facing possible default.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.620
So I went to Brussels on a mission

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.634
to make the case for a united European response,

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:32.934
one that would calm the markets and give us the time

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:35.940
to make the necessary reforms.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.844
But time we didn't get.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:41.980
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.871
Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,

00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:47.748
progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:49.320
a prime minister shouts out,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.840
"We have to finish in 10 minutes."

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.473
I said, "Why? These are important decisions.

00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:56.628
Let's deliberate a little bit longer."

00:05:56.628 --> 00:05:59.711
Another prime minister comes in and says,

00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:03.043
"No, we have to have an agreement now,

00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:05.395
because in 10 minutes,

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:08.960
the markets are opening up in Japan,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.409
and there will be havoc in the global economy."

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.822
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.

00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:19.098
This time it was not the military,

00:06:19.098 --> 00:06:25.586
but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:29.769
What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.996
painful to me, painful to my countrymen,

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:37.018
imposing cuts, austerity,

00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:40.244
often on those not to blame for the crisis.

00:06:40.244 --> 00:06:43.371
With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy

00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.523
and the eurozone avoided a collapse.

00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:49.171
Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,

00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:52.289
and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.336
But I think today that most would agree

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:57.702
that Greece was only a symptom

00:06:57.702 --> 00:07:01.379
of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.571
vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.217
vulnerabilities of our democracies.

00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:12.554
Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,

00:07:12.554 --> 00:07:15.923
or, more accurately, too big to control.

00:07:15.923 --> 00:07:18.252
Our democracies are weakened in the global economy

00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:21.723
with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,

00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:25.044
evade environmental or labor standards.

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.926
Our democracies are undermined

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:30.084
by the growing inequality

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:33.864
and the growing concentration of power and wealth,

00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:37.518
lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets

00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:42.357
or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:45.077
have constrained our democracies,

00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:47.965
and they have constrained our capacity

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:51.963
to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,

00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:54.478
in finding solutions.

00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:56.933
Greece, you see, was only a preview

00:07:56.933 --> 00:07:59.310
of what is in store for us all.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.000
I, overly optimistically, had hoped

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.791
that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,

00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:09.266
for the world, to make radical democratic transformations

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:11.143
in our institutions.

00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:15.040
Instead, I had a very humbling experience.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.521
In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again

00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.430
to find common solutions,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.103
I realized that not one, not one of us,

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:28.574
had ever dealt with a similar crisis.

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:32.570
But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.038
We were led by our fears.

00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:40.591
And our fears led to a blind faith

00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:43.756
in the orthodoxy of austerity.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:47.559
Instead of reaching out to the common

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.939
or the collective wisdom in our societies,

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:54.251
investing in it to find more creative solutions,

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.811
we reverted to political posturing.

00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:58.417
And then we were surprised when every

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:01.715
ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,

00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:04.644
and of course that made it very easy

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.491
to look for a whipping boy

00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:08.289
for our collective European failure,

00:09:08.289 --> 00:09:11.643
and of course that was Greece.

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:16.815
Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,

00:09:16.815 --> 00:09:19.880
they are the problem. Punish them!

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.090
Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.823
that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.

00:09:27.823 --> 00:09:31.135
But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:34.087
This could be the pattern

00:09:34.087 --> 00:09:36.593
that leaders follow again and again

00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:40.255
when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:43.975
whether it's climate change, whether it's migration,

00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:47.039
whether it's the financial system.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:49.625
That is, abandoning our collective power

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.504
to imagine our potential,

00:09:51.504 --> 00:09:55.683
falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,

00:09:55.683 --> 00:09:57.943
taking our citizens out of the process

00:09:57.943 --> 00:10:02.115
rather than building the process around our citizens.

00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:04.587
And doing so will only test the faith

00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:06.995
of our citizens, of our peoples, even more

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:09.557
in the democratic process.

00:10:09.557 --> 00:10:11.255
It's no wonder that many political leaders,

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:13.773
and I don't exclude myself,

00:10:13.773 --> 00:10:16.851
have lost the trust of our people.

00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:20.414
When riot police have to protect parliaments,

00:10:20.414 --> 00:10:24.611
a scene which is increasingly common around the world,

00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:29.361
then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:33.266
That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:37.502
own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:39.405
My European counterparts, some of them, at least,

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.390
said, "You can't do this.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.938
There will be havoc in the markets again."

00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:50.194
I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,

00:10:50.194 --> 00:10:55.782
we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."

00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:58.550
Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.670
We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.243
but we remain challenged.

00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:09.702
If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:13.846
well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,

00:11:13.846 --> 00:11:16.816
and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:19.282
if not a lack of compassion.

00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:21.823
So far, we've thrown economics at the problem,

00:11:21.823 --> 00:11:24.134
actually mostly austerity,

00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:27.364
and certainly we could have designed alternatives,

00:11:27.364 --> 00:11:30.686
a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,

00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:34.138
or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:37.262
support countries in need from market pressures,

00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:40.134
these would have been much more viable alternatives.

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:42.800
Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.759
one of economics as it is one of democracy.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.347
So let's try something else.

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:51.243
Let's see how we can bring people back to the process.

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:54.346
Let's throw democracy at the problem.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:57.331
Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,

00:11:57.331 --> 00:12:00.375
believed in the wisdom of the crowd

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.266
at their best moments. In people we trust.

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:06.609
Democracy could not work without the citizens

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:10.982
deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities

00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:12.916
for public affairs.

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:15.650
Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.877
to decide on critical matters of the day.

00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:22.954
Science, theater, research, philosophy,

00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:25.037
games of the mind and the body,

00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:26.765
they were daily exercises.

00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:30.917
Actually they were an education for participation,

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.457
for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.

00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:38.993
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:42.237
You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:44.508
that term originated there.

00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:49.301
"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:52.544
A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,

00:12:52.544 --> 00:12:57.259
someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.991
And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,

00:13:00.991 --> 00:13:07.368
both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.

00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:11.424
You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:14.630
accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.593
They serve the demos, democracy.

00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:22.217
Above government, above markets

00:13:22.217 --> 00:13:24.746
was the direct rule of the people.

00:13:24.746 --> 00:13:27.730
Today we have globalized the markets

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.193
but we have not globalized our democratic institutions.

00:13:32.193 --> 00:13:36.626
So our politicians are limited to local politics,

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:40.386
while our citizens, even though they see a great potential,

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:44.866
are prey to forces beyond their control.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.697
So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?

00:13:47.697 --> 00:13:49.937
How do we democratize globalization?

00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:52.506
And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:55.160
of the United Nations or the G20.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.641
I'm talking about, how do we secure the space,

00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:00.142
the demos, the platform of values,

00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:05.702
so that we can tap into all of your potential?

00:14:05.702 --> 00:14:09.577
Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.

00:14:09.577 --> 00:14:11.977
Europe, despite its recent failures,

00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:16.545
is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:19.792
So let's see if it can't be an experiment

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:23.972
in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.

00:14:23.972 --> 00:14:27.082
Let's see if we can't design a European agora,

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:29.614
not simply for products and services,

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:32.857
but for our citizens, where they can work together,

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:34.620
deliberate, learn from each other,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.836
exchange between art and cultures,

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:41.535
where they can come up with creative solutions.

00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:44.705
Let's imagine that European citizens

00:14:44.705 --> 00:14:46.999
actually have the power to vote directly

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:49.999
for a European president,

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:53.483
or citizen juries chosen by lottery

00:14:53.483 --> 00:14:57.709
which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:00.877
a European-wide referendum where our citizens,

00:15:00.877 --> 00:15:05.279
as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.759
And here's an idea:

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:10.683
Why not have the first truly European citizens

00:15:10.683 --> 00:15:12.703
by giving our immigrants,

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:16.815
not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:20.438
but a European citizenship?

00:15:20.438 --> 00:15:23.325
And make sure we actually empower

00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:26.104
the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship

00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:29.573
where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.

00:15:29.573 --> 00:15:34.054
Where our common identity is democracy,

00:15:34.054 --> 00:15:39.018
where our education is through participation,

00:15:39.018 --> 00:15:42.491
and where participation builds trust

00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:46.462
and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.

00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:48.124
Europe of and by the people,

00:15:48.124 --> 00:15:52.222
a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening

00:15:52.222 --> 00:15:55.238
democracy beyond borders.

00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:59.076
Now, some might accuse me of being naive,

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:03.947
putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.

00:16:03.947 --> 00:16:08.716
Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:11.272
Believe me, I have been,

00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:14.932
I am, part of today's political system,

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:19.569
and I know things must change.

00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:23.857
We must revive politics as the power to imagine,

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:29.080
reimagine, and redesign for a better world.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.894
But I also know that this disruptive force of change

00:16:31.894 --> 00:16:34.958
won't be driven by the politics of today.

00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.254
The revival of democratic politics

00:16:37.254 --> 00:16:41.674
will come from you, and I mean all of you.

00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:45.660
Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.709
whether it's here in this room

00:16:46.709 --> 00:16:48.922
or just outside this room

00:16:48.922 --> 00:16:52.756
or online or locally, where everybody lives,

00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:56.076
everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality,

00:16:56.076 --> 00:16:58.796
everybody who stands up to those who preach

00:16:58.796 --> 00:17:01.060
racism rather than empathy,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.876
dogma rather than critical thinking,

00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:06.192
technocracy rather than democracy,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.167
everyone who stands up to the unchecked power,

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:11.288
whether it's authoritarian leaders,

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:14.724
plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,

00:17:14.724 --> 00:17:18.644
or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.

00:17:18.644 --> 00:17:24.077
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:25.563
Let's not be.

00:17:25.563 --> 00:17:26.803
Thank you.

00:17:26.803 --> 00:17:38.713
(Applause)

00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:40.626
Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.811
that is kind of unprepared

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.593
and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,

00:17:45.593 --> 00:17:47.953
and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,

00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:50.456
as a citizen, is terrifying.

00:17:50.456 --> 00:17:54.755
Help us understand how you felt after the decision.

00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:56.323
It was not a good decision, clearly,

00:17:56.323 --> 00:17:58.907
but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,

00:17:58.907 --> 00:18:01.096
but as George?

00:18:01.096 --> 00:18:03.638
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints

00:18:03.638 --> 00:18:07.564
which didn't allow me or others to make

00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:09.004
the types of decisions we would have wanted,

00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:11.769
and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time

00:18:11.769 --> 00:18:13.476
to make the reforms which would have dealt

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:15.969
with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.684
which was the symptom of the problem.

00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:19.883
And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,

00:18:19.883 --> 00:18:23.387
hurt the younger generation, and not only,

00:18:23.387 --> 00:18:25.324
many of them are demonstrating outside,

00:18:25.324 --> 00:18:26.948
but I think this is one of our problems.

00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:32.180
When we face these crises, we have kept the potential,

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.315
the huge potential of our society out of this process,

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.139
and we are closing in on ourselves in politics,

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:40.885
and I think we need to change that, to really find

00:18:40.885 --> 00:18:45.058
new participatory ways using the great capabilities

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:48.208
that now exist even in technology but not only in technology,

00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:51.349
the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions

00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:53.156
which are much better, but we have to be open.

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:54.816
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:58.427
is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse

00:18:58.427 --> 00:19:00.150
right now in most European countries.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.877
It's rather the other way -- more closed borders

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:06.307
and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out

00:19:06.307 --> 00:19:10.012
of some of the different parts of the European construction.

00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:11.951
How do you reconcile that?

00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:14.380
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.612
during this crisis is that we started a blame game.

00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:20.170
And the fundamental idea of Europe is that

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.276
we can cooperate beyond borders,

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:24.577
go beyond our conflicts and work together.

00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:30.546
And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,

00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.726
we have less the potential to convince our citizens

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:35.437
that we should work together,

00:19:35.437 --> 00:19:37.510
while now is the time when we really need

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.278
to bring our powers together.

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:42.232
Now, more Europe for me is not simply

00:19:42.232 --> 00:19:43.687
giving more power to Brussels.

00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:47.560
It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.408
that is, really making Europe a project of the people.

00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:53.976
So that, I think, would be a way to answer

00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:56.849
some of the fears that we have in our society.

00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:58.372
BG: George, thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:58.372 --> 00:20:01.558
GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)
