00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
that delights and disturbs the senses.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
From urban planning and master planning

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
to theater and all sorts of stuff.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
The thing that all the work has in common

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And these are everyday conventions,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And I've assembled a sampling of work

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
that all share a kind of productive nihilism

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
This is an image that won us a competition

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
but as a primary building material.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.160
of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160
which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.160
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.160
to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and rethinks our dependence on vision?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
So this is how we sought to do it.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
wind direction, wind speed, dew point,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
and it processes this data in a central computer

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
that calibrates the degree of water pressure

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
and distribution of water throughout.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
and it sits on just four very delicate columns.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
These are the fog nozzles, the interface,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Now, here we go, one side, the outside

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
and then from the inside of the space

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
you can see what the quality of the space was.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Unlike entering any normal space,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
purposeless and dimensionless.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
All references are erased,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.160
leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
So, this is an exhibition pavilion

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.160
And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
So, the audience is dispersed,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
So here the world is put out of focus,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
while our visual dependence is put into focus.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
The public, you know, once disoriented

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
can actually ascend to the angel deck above

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
So, all the waters of the world are served there,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
so we thought that, you know, after being at the water

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
and moving through the water and breathing the water,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
you could also drink this building.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And so it is sort of a theme,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
We really wanted to bring out

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
our absolute dependence on this master sense,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
10 million dollars producing an effect

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
it was kind of a meaning machine

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
but it continues to live in edible form.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
And this is the highest honor

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Anyway, moving along.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
such as installation artist, architect,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
And we did a lot of media work,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
also a lot of experimental theater projects.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.160
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.160
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
the problem of the retrospective

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
was something we were very uncomfortable with.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
It's a kind of invention of the museum

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
to the public of a body of work.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.160
and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
So, what you see here

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
And we actually had to install white walls

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.160
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
And what you see is -- actually,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.160
cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
and it was really very much fun to work with them.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.160
They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
while they were helping us with this.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
In any case, the way it works is that

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.160
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.160
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Initially these holes were lone blemishes,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
and as the exhibition continued

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
the walls became increasingly perforated.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
opening views from gallery to gallery.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
And so this was a three-month performance piece

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.160
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Also the visual separation.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.160
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
And this is one of the blackout spaces

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.160
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
the wall now actively competed for attention.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.160
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
basically exposed the discomfort of the work

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.160
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.160
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
which is on the waterfront.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
but I'll simply say that the building negotiates

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.160
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.160
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.160
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
I mean that's its primary objective,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
both its program and its architectural conceit.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160
The building incorporates the site,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
but it dispenses it in very small doses

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
in the way that the museum is choreographed.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
where the view is turned off.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.160
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.160
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
And then, this is a view going up,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
and then you could come into the theater,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.160
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
The view is denied in the galleries

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
where we receive just natural light,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.160
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
The original intention of this space,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
which was unfortunately never realized,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
was to use lenticular glass

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.160
the intention was really to not get a climax,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
but to have the view stalk you,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
This was eliminated because the view was too good,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
The architect lost here.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
is this Mediatheque,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
So, it's already sticking out into space enough,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
where the public can get onto the server

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:02.160
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
and here is a point where architecture --

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.160
to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
or a lava lamp or something like that.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
of the technological and the natural in the project.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.160
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
Moving along to Lincoln Center.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.160
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.160
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.160
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And for the purposes of this talk,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
and it happens to be our current obsession,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.160
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
and descends several levels under the street.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
before the renovation, which we just started.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
And one of the things that we were asked to do

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160
was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160
where we're framing with this kind of canopy --

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.160
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
Before and after shot. (Applause)

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
to just talk about the hall itself,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.160
which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.160
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.160
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
The walls are made of absorptive surface,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
half absorptive, half reflective,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
which is not very good for concert sound.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.160
This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.160
was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Because we can't eliminate a single seat,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.160
the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
So it's a very, very thin architecture.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.160
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
to take away the distraction of the subway noise.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.160
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
with a material, with a wood material

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
that basically covers all the surfaces:

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.160
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Just everything is lined, it incorporates --

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
every single thing that you could possibly imagine

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
is tucked into this high-performance skin.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
But one more added feature.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
everything that prevents this intimacy

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.160
with the performers, we add one little detail,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
as it is when the concert starts.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
this lighting effect,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.160
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160
in a kind of seamless continuity

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.160
that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
it connects audience with players.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.160
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.160
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
this is what they look like out there.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
(Laughter)

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.160
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.160
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:03.160
the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
And this is Tully in construction now.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160
I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.160
Thank you very much.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
(Applause)
