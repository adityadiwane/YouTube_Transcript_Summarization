00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:16.693
Technology can change our understanding of nature.

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:19.844
Take for example the case of lions.

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:22.014
For centuries, it's been said that female lions

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:24.743
do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,

00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:28.724
and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.

00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:31.736
You've heard this too, I can tell.

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:34.322
Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.994
in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:39.586
Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:41.183
on male and female lions,

00:00:41.183 --> 00:00:42.791
and we mapped their hunting behavior

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:44.239
from the air.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.905
The lower left shows a lion sizing up

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:48.917
a herd of impala for a kill,

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:50.486
and the right shows what I call

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:52.349
the lion viewshed.

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:54.971
That's how far the lion can see in all directions

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:59.146
until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.587
And what we found

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:03.093
is that male lions are not the lazy hunters

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.617
we thought them to be.

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.754
They just use a different strategy.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.506
Whereas the female lions hunt

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:09.638
out in the open savanna

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:12.299
over long distances, usually during the day,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.309
male lions use an ambush strategy

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:19.042
in dense vegetation, and often at night.

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:22.048
This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.913
of male lions on the left

00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:25.902
and females on the right.

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:28.458
Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation,

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.573
and the white are wide open spaces.

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.673
And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:36.203
of hunting male and female lions.

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:38.532
All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:41.385
of the very spooky conditions under which

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:43.465
male lions do their hunting.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:44.961
I bring up this example to begin,

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.429
because it emphasizes how little
we know about nature.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.104
There's been a huge amount of work done so far

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:55.732
to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.681
and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,

00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.595
as shown in red on the slide.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.935
I find it ironic that we're doing so much,

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:05.568
yet these areas are fairly unknown to science.

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:08.225
So how can we save what we don't understand?

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:10.887
Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:12.578
with a background in physics and chemistry

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:15.782
and biology and a lot of other boring subjects,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:18.784
but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:20.496
about our planet.

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.170
So I created this,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.447
the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.

00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:27.504
It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:30.264
but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:32.700
of high-tech sensors, computers,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.911
and a very motivated staff

00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:37.380
of Earth scientists and pilots.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.240
Two of our instruments are very unique:

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.994
one is called an imaging spectrometer

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.856
that can actually measure the chemical composition

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.785
of plants as we fly over them.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.711
Another one is a set of lasers,

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:49.442
very high-powered lasers,

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:51.402
that fire out of the bottom of the plane,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:53.274
sweeping across the ecosystem

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:57.371
and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second

00:02:57.371 --> 00:02:59.849
in high-resolution 3D.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.833
Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.005
in San Francisco, not far from where I live.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:05.808
Although we flew straight over this bridge,

00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:07.464
we imaged it in 3D, captured its color

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.511
in just a few seconds.

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:11.606
But the real power of the CAO

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.781
is its ability to capture the actual building blocks

00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.550
of ecosystems.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.249
This is a small town in the Amazon,

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.864
imaged with the CAO.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.603
We can slice through our data

00:03:20.603 --> 00:03:22.867
and see, for example, the 3D structure

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:25.200
of the vegetation and the buildings,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.109
or we can use the chemical information

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.840
to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.183
as we fly over them.

00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:34.669
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.586
And we can see biodiversity in ways

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:38.745
that you never could have imagined.

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:40.296
This is what a rainforest might look like

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:42.503
as you fly over it in a hot air balloon.

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:44.597
This is how we see a rainforest,

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:46.942
in kaleidoscopic color that tells us

00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:49.884
that there are many species living with one another.

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:51.808
But you have to remember that these trees

00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:54.104
are literally bigger than whales,

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:57.016
and what that means is that
they're impossible to understand

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:59.991
just by walking on the ground below them.

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:04.629
So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.387
and this tells us not only the species

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:08.271
that are living in the canopy,

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:10.191
but it tells us a lot of information

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:13.767
about the rest of the species
that occupy the rainforest.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:15.898
Now I created the CAO

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:18.037
in order to answer questions that have proven

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:21.389
extremely challenging to answer
from any other vantage point,

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.266
such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:27.503
I want to share three of those
questions with you today.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:29.210
The first questions is,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.939
how do we manage our carbon reserves

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.695
in tropical forests?

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:37.254
Tropical forests contain a huge
amount of carbon in the trees,

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.668
and we need to keep that carbon in those forests

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:43.082
if we're going to avoid any further global warming.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.308
Unfortunately, global carbon emissions

00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.071
from deforestation

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:50.246
now equals the global transportation sector.

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:54.549
That's all ships, airplanes, trains 
and automobiles combined.

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:57.640
So it's understandable that policy negotiators

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.128
have been working hard to reduce deforestation,

00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.999
but they're doing it on landscapes

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.138
that are hardly known to science.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:06.499
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly,

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.351
in detail, how can you know what you're losing?

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:13.408
Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.

00:05:13.408 --> 00:05:15.724
With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:18.522
of tropical forests in utter detail.

00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:21.377
The red shows, obviously,
closed-canopy tropical forest,

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.395
and then you see the cookie cutting,

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:27.302
or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.

00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:30.125
It's like cutting a cake except this cake

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.324
is about whale deep.

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.292
And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.305
and the trees at the same time.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.507
And what's amazing is, even though we flew

00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:40.784
very high above this forest,

00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:42.687
later on in analysis, we can go in

00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:44.907
and actually experience the treetrops,

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:47.254
leaf by leaf, branch by branch,

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:50.761
just as the other species that live in this forest

00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:53.578
experience it along with the trees themselves.

00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:55.744
We've been using the technology to explore

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:58.614
and to actually put out the first carbon geographies

00:05:58.614 --> 00:06:00.228
in high resolution

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.474
in faraway places like the Amazon Basin

00:06:02.474 --> 00:06:04.761
and not-so-faraway places like the United States

00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.494
and Central America.

00:06:06.494 --> 00:06:09.994
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you
on a high-resolution, first-time tour

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.923
of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:16.685
The colors are going to be going from red to blue.

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:18.679
Red is extremely high carbon stocks,

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:21.218
your largest cathedral forests you can imagine,

00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:23.460
and blue are very low carbon stocks.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.894
And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,

00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:28.283
totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:29.869
until today.

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:31.715
We can fly to this area in northern Peru

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:33.851
and see super high carbon stocks in red,

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:35.340
and the Amazon River and floodplain

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.085
cutting right through it.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:38.983
We can go to an area of utter devastation

00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:40.818
caused by deforestation in blue,

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:44.260
and the virus of deforestation
spreading out in orange.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.944
We can also fly to the southern Andes

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:48.794
to see the tree line and see exactly how

00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:50.710
the carbon geography ends

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.416
as we go up into the mountain system.

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:56.321
And we can go to the biggest swamp
in the western Amazon.

00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:57.694
It's a watery dreamworld

00:06:57.694 --> 00:07:00.040
akin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.344
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,

00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:05.701
Panama, and see also a huge range

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:07.263
of carbon variation,

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:09.264
from high in red to low in blue.

00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:12.196
Unfortunately, most of the carbon
is lost in the lowlands,

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:13.742
but what you see that's left,

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:16.475
in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:18.589
is the stuff that's up in the mountains.

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.947
One interesting exception to this

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:22.563
is right in the middle of your screen.

00:07:22.563 --> 00:07:25.207
You're seeing the buffer zone
around the Panama Canal.

00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.120
That's in the reds and yellows.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.860
The canal authorities are using force

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.975
to protect their watershed and global commerce.

00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:33.465
This kind of carbon mapping

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.383
has transformed conservation

00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:36.979
and resource policy development.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.339
It's really advancing our ability to save forests

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:41.714
and to curb climate change.

00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:45.145
My second question: How do we
prepare for climate change

00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:47.291
in a place like the Amazon rainforest?

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.944
Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time

00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:52.169
in these places, and we're seeing
the climate changing already.

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.781
Temperatures are increasing,

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.413
and what's really happening is
we're getting a lot of droughts,

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:58.070
recurring droughts.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.887
The 2010 mega-drought is shown here

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.337
with red showing an area
about the size of Western Europe.

00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:05.599
The Amazon was so dry in 2010

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.001
that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself

00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:10.135
dried up partially, as you see in the photo

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.556
in the lower portion of the slide.

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:16.726
What we found is that in very remote areas,

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:19.472
these droughts are having a big negative impact

00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:21.060
on tropical forests.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.780
For example, these are all of the dead trees in red

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.841
that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.

00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.718
This area happens to be on the border

00:08:28.718 --> 00:08:30.117
of Peru and Brazil,

00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:31.653
totally unexplored,

00:08:31.653 --> 00:08:34.456
almost totally unknown scientifically.

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:36.922
So what we think, as Earth scientists,

00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:38.881
is species are going to have to migrate

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:41.673
with climate change from the east in Brazil

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:43.737
all the way west into the Andes

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:45.210
and up into the mountains

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.746
in order to minimize their
exposure to climate change.

00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:50.754
One of the problems with this is that humans

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:53.779
are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.888
Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash

00:08:55.888 --> 00:08:58.790
in the forest created by gold miners.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.068
You see the forest in green in 3D,

00:09:01.068 --> 00:09:02.902
and you see the effects of gold mining

00:09:02.902 --> 00:09:05.441
down below the soil surface.

00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:09.900
Species have nowhere to migrate
in a system like this, obviously.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.552
If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.590
It's an amazing experience every time,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.133
no matter where you go.

00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:19.529
You're going to probably see it this way, on a river.

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:21.293
But what happens is a lot of times

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:23.145
the rivers hide what's really going on

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.910
back in the forest itself.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.624
We flew over this same river,

00:09:27.624 --> 00:09:29.464
imaged the system in 3D.

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.280
The forest is on the left.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.266
And then we can digitally remove the forest

00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:35.725
and see what's going on below the canopy.

00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:38.175
And in this case, we found gold mining activity,

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:39.412
all of it illegal,

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.608
set back away from the river's edge,

00:09:41.608 --> 00:09:43.512
as you'll see in those strange pockmarks

00:09:43.512 --> 00:09:45.539
coming up on your screen on the right.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:47.868
Don't worry, we're working with the authorities

00:09:47.868 --> 00:09:50.319
to deal with this and many, many other problems

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:52.929
in the region.

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:55.984
So in order to put together a conservation plan

00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:57.724
for these unique, important corridors

00:09:57.724 --> 00:10:00.711
like the western Amazon
and the Andes Amazon corridor,

00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:02.875
we have to start making

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.281
geographically explicit plans now.

00:10:05.283 --> 00:10:09.258
How do we do that if we don't know
the geography of biodiversity in the region,

00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:10.953
if it's so unknown to science?

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:12.817
So what we've been doing is using

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:15.790
the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.014
to map for the first time the biodiversity

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:19.593
of the Amazon rainforest.

00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:23.130
Here you see actual data showing
different species in different colors.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.270
Reds are one type of species, blues are another,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.615
and greens are yet another.

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:29.778
And when we take this together and scale up

00:10:29.778 --> 00:10:31.662
to the regional level,

00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:34.231
we get a completely new geography

00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:38.619
of biodiversity unknown prior to this work.

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:40.767
This tells us where the big biodiversity changes

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.781
occur from habitat to habitat,

00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:44.964
and that's really important because it tells us

00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:47.859
a lot about where species may migrate to

00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:50.742
and migrate from as the climate shifts.

00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:53.964
And this is the pivotal information that's needed

00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:57.472
by decision makers to develop protected areas

00:10:57.472 --> 00:11:00.891
in the context of their regional development plans.

00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:02.788
And third and final question is,

00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:04.896
how do we manage biodiversity on a planet

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:06.874
of protected ecosystems?

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:09.625
The example I started out
with about lions hunting,

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.480
that was a study we did

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.472
behind the fence line of a protected area

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.204
in South Africa.

00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:17.202
And the truth is, much of Africa's nature

00:11:17.202 --> 00:11:19.117
is going to persist into the future

00:11:19.117 --> 00:11:22.363
in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.

00:11:22.363 --> 00:11:24.839
This puts incredible pressure and responsibility

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:26.458
on park management.

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:29.075
They need to do and make decisions

00:11:29.075 --> 00:11:32.366
that will benefit all of the species
that they're protecting.

00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:35.435
Some of their decisions have really big impacts.

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:37.511
For example, how much and where

00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:40.151
to use fire as a management tool?

00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:43.376
Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants,

00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:45.829
which may, if their populations get too large,

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:47.876
have a negative impact on the ecosystem

00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:49.478
and on other species.

00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:51.971
And let me tell you, these types of dynamics

00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:53.919
really play out on the landscape.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:56.380
In the foreground is an area with lots of fire

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.647
and lots of elephants:

00:11:57.647 --> 00:12:01.323
wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.

00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:03.504
As we cross this fence line, now we're getting

00:12:03.504 --> 00:12:05.828
into an area that has had protection from fire

00:12:05.828 --> 00:12:07.685
and zero elephants:

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:11.843
dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.

00:12:11.843 --> 00:12:14.233
And in a place like Kruger,

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.974
the soaring elephant densities

00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:17.717
are a real problem.

00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:20.081
I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,

00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:22.741
and there are no easy answers with this.

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:25.057
But what's good is that
the technology we've developed

00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:27.529
and we're working with in South Africa, for example,

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:30.885
is allowing us to map every
single tree in the savanna,

00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.454
and then through repeat flights

00:12:32.454 --> 00:12:34.200
we're able to see which trees

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.230
are being pushed over by elephants,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.488
in the red as you see on the screen,
and how much that's happening

00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:42.025
in different types of landscapes in the savanna.

00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:43.666
That's giving park managers

00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:46.029
a very first opportunity to use

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:49.371
tactical management strategies
that are more nuanced

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:53.193
and don't lead to those extremes
that I just showed you.

00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:56.905
So really, the way we're looking

00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:58.946
at protected areas nowadays

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.834
is to think of it as tending to a circle of life,

00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:03.882
where we have fire management,

00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:08.016
elephant management, those impacts on
the structure of the ecosystem,

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:10.006
and then those impacts

00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:12.312
affecting everything from insects

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:15.112
up to apex predators like lions.

00:13:15.112 --> 00:13:16.877
Going forward, I plan to greatly expand

00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:18.605
the airborne observatory.

00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:20.772
I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit

00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:22.455
so we can manage the entire planet

00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:24.188
with technologies like this.

00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:26.037
Until then, you're going to find me flying

00:13:26.037 --> 00:13:28.540
in some remote place that you've never heard of.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.082
I just want to end by saying that technology is

00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:34.821
absolutely critical to managing our planet,

00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:36.920
but even more important is the understanding

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.652
and wisdom to apply it.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.751
Thank you.

00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.828
(Applause)
