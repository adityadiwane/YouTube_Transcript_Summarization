00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:17.500
So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.631
Forty-two million people

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:22.741
were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.812
Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:29.108
because, on average, 31 and a half million people

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:32.211
are displaced by natural disasters every single year.

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:34.759
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.553
you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:40.973
exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:44.096
right here in the United States every single year.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.111
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:49.357
were on file with FEMA,

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:52.548
from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:56.939
to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.004
Now, how does the most powerful country in the world

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.103
handle these displaced people?

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.532
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.700
in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.715
and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:12.226
or a gymnasium.

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:15.288
So obviously there's a massive housing gap,

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:18.196
and this really upset me, because academia tells you

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:20.485
after a major disaster, there's typically about

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.824
an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover,

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:25.401
start the recovery process,

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:27.766
but what most people don't realize is that on average

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.830
it takes 45 to 60 days or more

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.692
for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:37.310
Before that time, people are left to their own devices.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.686
So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:42.836
to actually fill this gap.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.390
This actually became my creative obsession.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.095
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:53.837
just focusing particularly on this problem.

00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:55.196
So I started sketching.

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.220
Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.068
and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.226
and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.452
I started sketching digitally on the computer,

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:07.921
but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.060
I started experimenting, making models,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.838
talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:15.749
and refining, and I kept on refining and refining

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.805
for nights and weekends for over five years.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.290
Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.575
full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) —

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:26.941
and actually spending my own personal savings on

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.190
everything from tooling to patents

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.806
and a variety of other costs,

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:34.670
but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.332
that can react to any situation or disaster.

00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:40.431
It can be put up in any environment,

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.374
from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:46.377
because it doesn't require any special setup

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:48.559
or specialty tools.

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.279
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.213
of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:55.646
which is just the individual shelter module.

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:57.378
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:59.534
lift it by hand and move it around,

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:03.233
and it actually sleeps four people.

00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:05.901
And you can arrange these things as kind of more

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:08.676
for encampments and more of a city grid type layout,

00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:10.571
or you can circle the wagons, essentially,

00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:12.582
and form these circular pods out of them,

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:15.038
which give you this semi-private communal area

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:17.807
for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.906
trapped inside these units.

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.331
Now this fundamentally changes

00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.489
the way we respond to disasters,

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.467
because gone are the horrid conditions

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.192
inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people

00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:31.204
are crammed on these cots inside.

00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:36.791
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.

00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.766
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.008
like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together

00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:44.933
so we get extremely efficient transportation

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.184
and storage out of them.

00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:51.820
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.994
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:59.978
faster than any other housing option available today.

00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:01.967
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:03.856
so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:06.164
actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:07.676
so the same unit can now be used

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:10.901
for an office or storage location.

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.619
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.488
a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,

00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:19.954
or a connector module that would allow you to actually

00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:22.339
connect multiple units together, which gives you

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:26.005
larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,

00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:28.317
so now this same kit of parts, this same unit

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:32.960
can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.067
or an office, a living space and secure storage.

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.134
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:44.138
So the first idea I had, initially, was just

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:45.994
to go the federal and state governments and go,

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.657
"Here, take it, for free."

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:50.640
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.898
doesn't really work like that." (Laughter)

00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:56.883
Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit

00:04:56.883 --> 00:04:59.726
to kind of help consult and get this idea going

00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:01.829
along with the government, but then I was told,

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:04.304
"Son, our government looks to private sector

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.901
for things like this."

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.891
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.311
to private corporations that would have this mutually shared

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.214
benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:18.495
that my personal passion project was not a brand fit

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:21.073
because they didn't want their logos stamped

00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.497
across the ghettos of Haiti.

00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:29.433
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.850
So I decided, kind of told myself,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.725
"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter)

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:41.905
Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:45.059
our Milan office for a few months, so I was like,

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.796
what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:50.996
and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:55.016
with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:56.470
And we found through this whole process, we found

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.844
this great little manufacturer in Virginia,

00:05:58.844 --> 00:06:00.997
and if his body language is any indication,

00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:03.076
that's the owner — (Laughter) — of what it's like

00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:05.169
for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.372
you've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)

00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:10.628
But G.S. Industries was fantastic.

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:15.008
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:18.155
So now we have prototypes that can show that four people

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:20.571
can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:25.068
than a tent could ever provide.

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:26.818
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.

00:06:26.818 --> 00:06:28.271
Now, a funny thing started happening.

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:30.739
Other people started to believe in what we were doing,

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.656
and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar

00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:34.940
space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.046
was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.707
So now we had a hangar space to work in,

00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:43.789
and prototypes to demo with.

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.356
So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.017
been awarded one patent, filed our second patent,

00:06:50.017 --> 00:06:52.700
talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.948
and its consultants to rave reviews,

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.131
and then started talking to some other people who requested

00:06:57.131 --> 00:06:59.622
information, this little group called the United Nations.

00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:01.727
And on top of that, now we have

00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:04.371
a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up

00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.862
and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:10.294
mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup

00:07:10.294 --> 00:07:12.879
and the Olympics.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:19.971
So, in closing, on this whole thing here

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.627
is hopefully very soon we will not have to

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:26.548
respond to these painful phone calls that we get

00:07:26.548 --> 00:07:28.544
after disasters where we don't really have anything

00:07:28.544 --> 00:07:30.932
to sell or give you yet.

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:33.364
Hopefully very soon we will be there,

00:07:33.364 --> 00:07:35.571
because we are destined,

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.677
obsessed with making it real.

00:07:39.677 --> 00:07:42.018
Thank you. (Applause)
