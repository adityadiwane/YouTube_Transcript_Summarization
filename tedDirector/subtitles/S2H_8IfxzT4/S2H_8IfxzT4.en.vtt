00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.816
I am multidisciplinary.

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:19.799
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander
for a NASA Mars simulation last year,

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:26.718
and as an artist, I create multicultural
community art all over the planet.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.622
And recently, I've actually
been combining both.

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.627
But let me first talk a little more
about that NASA mission.

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:35.240
This is the HI-SEAS program.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.936
HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded
planetary surface analogue

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.664
on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:44.690
and it's a research program
that is specifically designed

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.713
to study the effects
of long-term isolation of small crews.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.601
I lived in this dome for four months
with a crew of six,

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.386
a very interesting experience, of course.

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.369
We did all kinds of research.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.821
Our main research
was actually a food study,

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:03.700
but apart from that food study --

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.488
developing a new food system
for astronauts living in deep space --

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.621
we also did all kinds of other research.

00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.942
We did extra-vehicular activities,
as you can see here,

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:14.986
wearing mock-up space suits,

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:17.655
but we also had our chores
and lots of other stuff to do,

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:19.907
like questionnaires
at the end of every day.

00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:21.700
Busy, busy work.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.752
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:26.804
it's quite challenging to live
with just a small group of people

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:28.987
in a small space for a long time.

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:31.216
There's all kinds
of psychological challenges:

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:35.092
how to keep a team together
in these circumstances;

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.822
how to deal with the warping of time
you start to sense

00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:40.015
when you're living in these circumstances;

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:41.949
sleep problems that arise; etc.

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:44.033
But also we learned a lot.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.749
I learned a lot about
how individual crew members

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.419
actually cope with a situation like this;

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:52.926
how you can keep a crew
productive and happy,

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:55.526
for example, giving them
a good deal of autonomy

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:57.058
is a good trick to do that;

00:01:57.058 --> 00:02:00.047
and honestly, I learned
a lot about leadership,

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:01.935
because I was a crew commander.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:03.839
So doing this mission,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.725
I really started thinking more deeply
about our future in outer space.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.394
We will venture into outer space,
and we will start inhabiting outer space.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:14.159
I have no doubt about it.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.744
It might take 50 years
or it might take 500 years,

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:20.443
but it's going to happen nevertheless.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:24.434
So I came up with
a new art project called Seeker.

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:28.355
And the Seeker project is actually
challenging communities all over the world

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.209
to come up with starship prototypes

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.513
that re-envision
human habitation and survival.

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:36.382
That's the core of the project.

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:38.739
Now, one important thing:

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.244
This is not a dystopian project.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.956
This is not about, "Oh my God,
the world is going wrong

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:47.218
and we have to escape because we need
another future somewhere else."

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:48.499
No, no.

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.696
The project is basically inviting people

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:54.661
to take a step away
from earthbound constraints

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.319
and, as such, reimagine our future.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.003
And it's really helpful,
and it works really well,

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:04.260
so that's really the important part
of what we're doing.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.988
Now, in this project,
I'm using a cocreation approach,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.078
which is a slightly different approach

00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:13.580
from what you would expect
from many artists.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.962
I'm essentially dropping a basic idea
into a group, into a community,

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:20.491
people start gravitating to the idea,

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.851
and together, we shape 
and build the artwork.

00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:26.018
It's a little bit like termites, really.

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:27.308
We just work together,

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:30.264
and even, for example,
when architects visit what we're doing,

00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:32.849
sometimes they have a bit
of a hard time understanding

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.527
how we build without a master plan.

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:37.986
We always come up with these
fantastic large-scale scupltures

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:40.528
that actually we can also inhabit.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:45.022
The first version was done
in Belgium and Holland.

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.924
It was built with a team
of almost 50 people.

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:50.785
This is the second iteration
of that same project,

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:52.745
but in Slovenia, in a different country,

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:56.987
and the new group was like, we're going 
to do the architecture differently.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:00.291
So they took away the architecture,
they kept the base of the artwork,

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.343
and they built an entirely new,

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:05.014
much more biomorphic
architecture on top of that.

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:07.429
And that's another
crucial part of the project.

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:11.310
It's an evolving artwork,
evolving architecture.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.137
This was the last version that was just
presented a few weeks ago in Holland,

00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:19.282
which was using caravans 
as modules to build a starship.

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:21.308
We bought some second-hand caravans,

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:22.605
cut them open,

00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:25.342
and reassembled them into a starship.

00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:28.249
Now, when we're thinking about starships,

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.287
we're not just approaching it
as a technological challenge.

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:34.215
We're really looking at it
as a combination of three systems:

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.596
ecology, people and technology.

00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:40.154
So there's always a strong ecological
component in the project.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.523
Here you can see aquaponic systems

00:04:42.523 --> 00:04:44.727
that are actually
surrounding the astronauts,

00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:50.219
so they're constantly in contact
with part of the food that they're eating.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.695
Now, a very typical thing for this project

00:04:53.695 --> 00:05:00.773
is that we run our own isolation missions
inside these art and design projects.

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:03.747
We actually lock ourselves up
for multiple days on end,

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:05.447
and test what we build.

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:06.875
And this is, for example,

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.489
on the right hand side
you can see an isolation mission

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:12.407
in the Museum of Modern Art
in Ljubljana in Slovenia,

00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:15.025
where six artists and designers
locked themselves up --

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:16.935
I was part of that --

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:19.173
for four days inside the museum.

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:21.928
And, of course, obviously,
this is a very performative

00:05:21.928 --> 00:05:26.130
and very strong experience for all of us.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.549
Now, the next version of the project
is currently being developed

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:34.512
together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,
who is also a TED Fellow,

00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:38.788
in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
a magical place.

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:41.896
First of all, it's really
considered a Mars analogue.

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.590
It really does look like Mars
in certain locations

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.119
and has been used by NASA
to test equipment.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:51.222
And it has a long history
of being connected to space

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:53.977
through observations of the stars.

00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:55.645
It's now home to ALMA,

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.423
the large telescope
that's being developed there.

00:05:59.183 --> 00:06:03.143
But also, it's the driest
location on the planet,

00:06:03.143 --> 00:06:06.144
and that makes it extremely interesting
to build our project,

00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:11.829
because suddenly, sustainability
is something we have to explore fully.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:13.661
We have no other option,

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:16.074
so I'm very curious to see
what's going to happen.

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:20.231
Now, a specific thing for this
particular version of the project

00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:22.413
is that I'm very interested to see

00:06:22.413 --> 00:06:24.569
how we can connect
with the local population,

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.802
the native population.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.544
These people have been living there
for a very long time

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:31.516
and can be considered
experts in sustainability,

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.487
and so I'm very interested
to see what we can learn from them,

00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:37.819
and have an input of indigenous knowledge
into space exploration.

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.598
So we're trying to redefine
how we look at our future in outer space

00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:48.002
by exploring integration,
biology, technology and people;

00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:50.652
by using a cocreation approach;

00:06:50.652 --> 00:06:54.099
and by using and exploring
local traditions

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.528
and to see how we can learn from the past
and integrate that into our deep future.

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:00.321
Thank you.

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.945
(Applause)
