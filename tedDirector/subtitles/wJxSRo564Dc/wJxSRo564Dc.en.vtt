00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I have a big impact on the planet

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
to travel here by plane.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.160
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
that is the weight of two elephants.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I came here to speak about ecology,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
and I emitted as much CO2

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
as a Frenchman in one year.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
So what do I have to do?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
(Laughter)

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I have to do my carbon offset in another way,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
like I do every time.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
(Laughter)

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
In fact my work is to show

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
our impact on our planet.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I'm going to show you some examples

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
of the last pictures I've done

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
in the last year.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
You know the problem;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.160
we don't want to believe what we know.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
In Alberta people work nonstop,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
24 hours by seven

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
to extract as much oil

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
as they can.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
We know about the end of oil.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
But we use three times more oil

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
than we find every year.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
We don't want to believe what we know.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Deny.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Coral reef in New Caledonia.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
100 percent of the coral

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
may be wiped out before 2050

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
because of global warming.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
The thickness of the Arctic

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
decreased more than 40 percent

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
since 1960.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Sad picture.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
It lost 80 percent of its ice.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
According to scientists,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
in 100 years

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
all the mountain glacier will be gone.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Like Al Gore told you,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
two billion people live on the water

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
from the glacier of Himalaya.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Return of fish men.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
One fifth of human kind

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
depend on fish to live.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Today now 70 percent

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
of the fish stock are over-exploited.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
According to FAO,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
if we don't change our system of fishing

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
We don't want to believe what we know.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.160
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
One human of six

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
have not enough to eat in the world.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
One billion people have not enough to eat.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.160
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Here in America,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
90 percent of the corn cultivated

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.160
is used to feed animals or to do oil.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Palm tree plantation in Borneo.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.160
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Refugee camp in Darfur.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
According to the U.N.,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
we speak about 250 million refugees

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.160
in 2050.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I always show my pictures in the street.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
But how to understand the world

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
without the voice of people?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Landscape was not enough.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
It was obvious to me to do another work.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
I sent around the world six cameramen

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
asking the same question,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
the same crucial question,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
about life.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
We have done five thousand interviews.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
I'm going to show you this.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.160
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Woman: You're asking me a hard question.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,)

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
and speak to the people,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
when we were taking her sons.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
I feel ashamed.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
And I feel humbled

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
by their strength.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And I will forever feel a need

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.160
to make reparations to Iraq.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160
My family ... What can I say?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
At the moment, my family is very poor,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:14.160
my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.160
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:34.160
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
Thank you.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
Thank you for having fed me and raised me,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and for making my life of today. Thank you.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
I've done more in life being in a chair

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
than out of a chair.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.160
After many people said I couldn't do that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
And I think that comes from connecting with nature,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
connecting with the energy of life,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
spiritually, mentally or physically.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
I got the easy part.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.160
14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
You come from elsewhere.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160
You don't know me. I don't know you.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
We talk without lying.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.160
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
and we become friends.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.160
How can we make it all by ourselves?

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:10.160
(Applause)

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
YAB: You can also go to the website,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
answer -- respond to the questions also.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Forty crucial questions.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
For the last three years,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
I was shooting the earth for the movie.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
The name of the movie is "Home" --

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
"Maison."

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
It is about the state of the planet.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.160
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:52.160
Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
These plants, several hundred million years old.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
And we humans have been walking upright

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
for only 200 thousand years.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160
We've managed to adapt,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
and have conquered the whole planet.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
For generations, we've been raising our children,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
For the past 30 years

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
from high up in the sky.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
We depend on water,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
forests,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
deserts,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
oceans.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Fishing,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
breeding,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
farming

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
are still the world's foremost human occupations.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
And what binds us together

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160
is far greater than what divides us.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
the same wish to rise above ourselves,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
and become better.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
And yet we carry on raising walls

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
to keep us apart.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
Today our greatest battle

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
In less than 50 years

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
we've altered it more thoroughly

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
than in the entire history of mankind.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Half of the world's forests have vanished.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
Water resources are running low.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Intensive farming is depleting soils.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
Our energy sources are not sustainable.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
The climate is changing.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
We are endangering ourselves.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
We're only trying to improve our lives.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
We haven't yet understood

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
that we're going at a much faster pace

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
than the planet can sustain.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
We know that solutions are available today.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
We all have the power to change this trend

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
for the better.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
So what are we waiting for?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:13.160
(Applause)

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.160
YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
But it is not a normal movie.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
The film is going to be distributed free.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
This film has no copyright.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
On the five of June,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
the environment day,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.160
everybody can download the movie on Internet.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160
The film is given for free

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.160
to the distributor for TV and theater

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
to show it the fifth of June.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
There is no business on this movie.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
It is also available for school,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.160
cities, NGOs and you.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
We have to believe what we know.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Let me tell you something.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
It's too late to be pessimistic --

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
really too late.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:23.160
We have all a part of the solutions.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
To finish,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
I would like to welcome

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
the 4,700th baby

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:38.160
born since the beginning of this talk.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Merci beaucoup. I love you.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:48.160
