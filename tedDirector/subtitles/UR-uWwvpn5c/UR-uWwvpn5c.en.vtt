00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
My topic

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is economic growth in China and India.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And the question I want to explore with you

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
is whether or not

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
democracy has helped or has hindered

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
economic growth.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
You may say this is not fair,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
because I'm selecting two countries

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
to make a case against democracy.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Actually, exactly the opposite

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
is what I'm going to do.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I'm going to use these two countries

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to make an economic argument for democracy,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
rather than against democracy.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
The first question there

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
is why China has grown so much faster

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
than India.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Over the last 30 years,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in terms of the GDP growth rates,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
China has grown at twice the rate of India.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
In the last five years,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
the two countries have begun to converge somewhat

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
in economic growth.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
But over the last 30 years,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
China undoubtedly

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
has done much better than India.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
One simple answer

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
This is the Pudong area.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
The picture on India

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
in India.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
The idea there

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
behind these two pictures

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
is that the Chinese government

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
can act above rule of law.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
It can plan

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
for the long-term benefits of the country

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and in the process,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
evict millions of people --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that's just a small technical issue.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Whereas in India, you cannot do that,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
because you have to listen to the public.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
You're being constrained by the public's opinion.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
agrees with that view.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
In an interview

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
printed in the financial press of India,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
He said that he wants to make Mumbai

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
another Shanghai.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
This is an Oxford-trained economist

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
steeped in humanistic values,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and yet he agrees

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
that emphasizes the following features

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
for promoting economic development:

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
infrastructures, airports,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
highways, bridges, things like that.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And you need a strong government to do that,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
because you cannot respect private property rights.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
You need also state ownership,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
especially of land assets,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
in order to build and roll out infrastructures

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
very quickly.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
The implication of that model

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
is that democracy

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
is a hindrance for economic growth,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
rather than a facilitator of economic growth.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Here's the key question.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Just how important are infrastructures

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
for economic growth?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
This is a key issue.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
then you would argue a strong government is necessary

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to promote growth.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
If you believe

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
then you will put less emphasis

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
on strong government.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So to illustrate that question,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
let me give you two countries.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And for the sake of brevity,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
I'll call one country Country 1

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and the other country Country 2.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Country 1

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
has a systematic advantage over Country 2

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
in infrastructures.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Country 1 has more telephones,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So if I were to ask you,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
"Which is China

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and which is India,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and which country has grown faster?"

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
if you believe in the infrastructure view,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And Country 2 is possibly India."

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Actually the country with more telephones

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
is the Soviet Union,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and the data referred to 1989.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
the country collapsed.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
That's not too good.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The picture there is Khrushchev.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I know that in 1989

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
but that's the best picture that I can find.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
(Laughter)

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Telephones, infrastructures

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
do not guarantee you economic growth.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Country 2, that has fewer telephones,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
is China.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Since 1989,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
the country has performed at a double-digit rate

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
every year for the last 20 years.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
other than the fact about their telephones,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
you would have made a poor prediction

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
about their economic growth

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
in the next two decades.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
is actually India.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And Country 2 is China.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This is a very little known fact

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
about the two countries.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
over India.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
But for many years,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
until the late 1990s,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
China had an infrastructure disadvantage

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
vis-a-vis India.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
In developing countries,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
the most common mode of transportation

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
is the railways,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and the British built a lot of railways in India.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
India is the smaller of the two countries,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and yet it had a longer system of railways

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
until the late 1990s.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
So clearly,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
infrastructure doesn't explain

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
why China did better before the late 1990s,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
as compared with India.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
the evidence is more supportive of the view

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
The economy grows,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
government accumulates more resources,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and the government can invest in infrastructure --

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
rather than infrastructure being a cause

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
for economic growth.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And this is clearly the story

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
of the Chinese economic growth.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Let me look at this question more directly.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Is democracy bad for economic growth?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Now let's turn to two countries,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Country A and Country B.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Country A, in 1990,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
had about $300 per capita GDP

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
as compared with Country B,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
which had $460 in per capita GDP.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
By 2008,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Country A has surpassed Country B

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
with $700 per capita GDP

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
as compared with $650 per capita GDP.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Both countries are in Asia.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
If I were to ask you,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
"Which are the two Asian countries?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And which one is a democracy?"

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
you may argue,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
"Well, maybe Country A is China

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and Country B is India."

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
In fact, Country A

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is democratic India,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and Country B is Pakistan --

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the country that has a long period

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
of military rule.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And it's very common

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that we compare India with China.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
That's because the two countries

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
have about the same population size.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But the more natural comparison

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
is actually between India and Pakistan.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Those two countries are geographically similar.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.260
They have a complicated, but shared common history.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
By that comparison,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
democracy looks very, very good

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
in terms of economic growth.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So why do economists fall in love

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
with authoritarian governments?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
One reason is the East Asian Model.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
In East Asia,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
we have had successful economic growth stories

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
such as Korea, Taiwan,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Hong Kong and Singapore.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Some of these economies

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
were ruled by authoritarian governments

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
in the 60s and 70s

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and 1980s.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The problem with that view

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
is like asking all the winners of lotteries,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
"Have you won the lottery?"

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And then you draw the conclusion

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
the odds of winning the lottery

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
are 100 percent.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
The reason is you never go

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and bother to ask the losers

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
who also purchased lottery tickets

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and didn't end up winning the prize.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
For each of these successful authoritarian governments

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
in East Asia,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
there's a matched failure.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Burma didn't succeed.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
The Philippines didn't succeed.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
there's really no support for the idea

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that authoritarian governments

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
hold a systematic edge over democracies

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
in terms of economic growth.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
So the East Asian model

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
has this massive selection bias --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260
something we always tell our students to avoid.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
So exactly why did China grow so much faster?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
when China went mad,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and compare that country's performance with India

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
under Indira Gandhi.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
The question there is: Which country did better,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
China or India?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
China was during the Cultural Revolution.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
China out-perfomed India

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
in terms of GDP growth

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
by an average of about 2.2 percent every year

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
in terms of per capita GDP.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
So that's when China was mad.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
The whole country went mad.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
It must mean that the country

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.260
had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
to overcome the negative effects

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
of the Cultural Revolution.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
The advantage the country had

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
was human capital --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
nothing else but human capital.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
This is the world development index indicator data

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
in the early 1990s.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And this is the earliest data that I can find.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
The adult literacy rate in China

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
is 77 percent

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
as compared with 48 percent in India.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
The contrast in literacy rates

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
is especially sharp

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
between Chinese women and Indian women.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.260
I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
In China, the definition of literacy

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
is the ability to read and write

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
1,500 Chinese characters.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
In India, the definition of literacy,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
operating definition of literacy,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
is the ability, the grand ability,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
to write your own name

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260
in whatever language you happen to speak.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
is much more substantial

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
than the data here indicated.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
If you go to other sources of data

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
such as Human Development Index,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
that data series,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
go back to the early 1970s,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
you see exactly the same contrast.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
China held a huge advantage

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
in terms of human capital

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
vis-a-vis India.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Life expectancies:

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
as early as 1965,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
On average, as a Chinese in 1965,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
you lived 10 years more

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
than an average Indian.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
So if you have a choice

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
between being a Chinese and being an Indian,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
you would want to become a Chinese

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
in order to live 10 years longer.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
If you made that decision in 1965,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
the down side of that

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So you have to always think carefully

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
about these decisions.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
If you cannot chose your nationality,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
then you will want to become an Indian man.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Because, as an Indian man,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
you have about two years of life expectancy advantage

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
vis-a-vis Indian women.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
This is an extremely strange fact.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
It's very rare among countries

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
to have this kind of pattern.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
It shows the systematic discrimination and biases

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
in the Indian society

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
against women.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
The good news is, by 2006,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
India has closed the gap

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
between men and women

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
in terms of life expectancy.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
over Indian men.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
So India is reverting to the normal.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
But India still has a lot of work to do

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
in terms of gender equality.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
These are the two pictures

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
and garment factories in India.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
In China, it's all women.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
in the coastal part of the country,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
whereas in India, it's all men.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Financial Times printed this picture

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
of an Indian textile factory

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
By looking at these two pictures,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.260
I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
If you look at other East Asian countries,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.260
women there play a hugely important role

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
in terms of economic take-off --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
associated with East Asia.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
India still has a long way to go

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
to catch up with China.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Then the issue is,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
what about the Chinese political system?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
You talk about human capital,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
you talk about education and public health.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
What about the political system?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Isn't it true that the one-party political system

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.260
has facilitated economic growth in China?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
It depends on a distinction that you draw

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
between statics of the political system

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and the dynamics of the political system.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Statically, China is a one-party system,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
authoritarian -- there's no question about it.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
Dynamically, it has changed over time

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
to become less authoritarian and more democratic.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
When you explain change --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
for example, economic growth;

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
economic growth is about change --

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
when you explain change,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
you use other things that have changed to explain change,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.260
rather than using the constant to explain change.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
but a fixed effect only explains changes

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in interaction with the things that change.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
In terms of the political changes,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
they have introduced village elections.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.260
They have increased the security of proprietors.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And they have increased the security

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
with long-term land leases.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
There are also financial reforms in rural China.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
To me, the pace of political changes

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
is too slow, too gradual.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
And my own view is the country

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
is going to face some substantial challenges,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.260
because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
But nevertheless,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
the system has moved in a more liberal direction,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
moved in a more democratic direction.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.260
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
In fact, when India was growing

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
at a Hindu rate of growth --

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
about one percent, two percent a year --

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
that was when India was least democratic.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
The Indian government owned and operated

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
all the TV stations.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
is that the country

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
not only has undertaken economic reforms,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
the country has also undertaken political reforms

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
by introducing village self-rule,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
privatization of media

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
and introducing freedom of information acts.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
So the dynamic perspective

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
fits both with China and in India

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
in terms of the direction.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Why do many people believe

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
that India is still a growth disaster?

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
One reason

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
is they are always comparing India with China.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
But China is a superstar

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
in terms of economic growth.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
If you are a NBA player

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
you're going to look not so impressive.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
But that doesn't mean

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
that you're a bad basketball player.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Comparing with a superstar

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
is the wrong benchmark.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
In fact, if you compare India

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
with the average developing country,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
even before the more recent period

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
of acceleration of Indian growth --

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
now India is growing between eight and nine percent --

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
even before this period,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
among emerging economies.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
This is a very impressive record indeed.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Let's think about the future:

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
Which country has the growth momentum?

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
China, I believe, still has

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
some of the excellent raw fundamentals --

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
mostly the social capital,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
the public health,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
the sense of egalitarianism

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
that you don't find in India.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
But I believe that India has the momentum.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
It has the improving fundamentals.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
The government has invested in basic education,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
has invested in basic health.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
I believe the government should do more,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
is the right direction.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
India has the right institutional conditions

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
for economic growth,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
whereas China is still struggling

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
with political reforms.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
I believe that the political reforms are a must for China

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
to maintain its growth.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And it's very important to have political reforms,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
but I'm an optimist.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
that political reforms will happen in China.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
