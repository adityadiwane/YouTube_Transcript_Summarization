00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.555
What if our plants

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.276
could sense the toxicity
levels in the soil

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.340
and express that toxicity
through the color of its leaves?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.820
What if those plants could also
remove those toxins from the soil?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.476
Instead, what if those plants

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.356
grew their own packaging,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.956
or were designed to only be harvested

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.236
by their owners' own patented machines?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.156
What happens when biological design

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.716
is driven by the motivations
of mass-produced commodities?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.340
What kind of world would that be?

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.076
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer
and researcher at MIT Media Lab,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.236
where I'm part of a relatively new
and unique group called Design Fiction,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.356
where we're wedged somewhere
between science fiction and science fact.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.516
And at MIT, I am lucky enough
to rub shoulders with scientists

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.516
studying all kinds of cutting edge fields

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.916
like synthetic neurobiology,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.956
artificial intelligence, artificial life

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.716
and everything in between.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.556
And across campus,
there's truly brilliant scientists

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.076
asking questions like,
"How can I make the world a better place?"

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.996
And part of what my group
likes to ask is, "What is better?"

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.116
What is better for you, for me,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.276
for a white woman, a gay man,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.796
a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.876
Technology is never neutral.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.556
It frames a reality

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.356
and reflects a context.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.116
Can you imagine what it would say
about the work-life balance at your office

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.316
if these were standard issue
on the first day?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.756
(Laughter)

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.036
I believe it's the role
of artists and designers

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.196
to raise critical questions.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.636
Art is how you can see
and feel the future,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.116
and today is an exciting
time to be a designer,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.276
for all the new tools becoming accessible.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.876
For instance, synthetic biology

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.796
seeks to write biology
as a design problem.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.356
And through these developments,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.316
my lab asks, what are the roles
and responsibilities

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.676
of an artist, designer,
scientist or businessman?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.236
What are the implications

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.996
of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.636
and how are they shaping our notions
of what it means to be a human?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.956
What are the implications of this
on society, on evolution

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.556
and what are the stakes in this game?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.796
My own speculative design research
at the current moment

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.236
plays with synthetic biology,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.276
but for more emotionally driven output.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.076
I'm obsessed with olfaction
as a design space,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.916
and this project started with this idea

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.716
of what if you could take
a smell selfie, a smelfie?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.196
(Laughter)

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.956
What if you could take
your own natural body odor

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.036
and send it to a lover?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.836
Funny enough, I found that this
was a 19th century Austrian tradition,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.476
where couples in courtship
would keep a slice of apple

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.076
crammed under their armpit during dances,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.636
and at the end of the evening,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.036
the girl would give the guy
she most fancied her used fruit,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.236
and if the feeling was mutual,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.196
he would wolf down that stinky apple.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.340
(Laughter)

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.796
Famously, Napoleon wrote
many love letters to Josephine,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.076
but perhaps amongst the most memorable
is this brief and urgent note:

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.316
"Home in three days. Don't bathe."

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.396
(Laughter)

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.580
Both Napoleon and Josephine
adored violets.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.276
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.116
carried violets on their wedding day,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.155
and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:26.716
every year on their anniversary.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.316
When Josephine passed away,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.916
he planted violets at her grave,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.756
and just before his exile,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.916
he went back to that tomb site,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.596
picked some of those flowers,
entombed them in a locket

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.356
and wore them until the day he died.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.916
And I found this so moving,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.836
I thought, could I engineer that violet
to smell just like Josephine?

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.516
What if, for the rest of eternity,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.116
when you went to visit her site,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.396
you could smell Josephine
just as Napoleon loved her?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.836
Could we engineer new ways of mourning,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.956
new rituals for remembering?

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.676
After all, we've engineered
transgenic crops

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.836
to be maximized for profit,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.996
crops that stand up to transport,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.956
crops that have a long shelf life,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.436
crops that taste sugary sweet
but resist pests,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.876
sometimes at the expense
of nutritional value.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.476
Can we harness these same technologies
for an emotionally sensitive output?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.796
So currently in my lab,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.116
I'm researching questions like,
what makes a human smell like a human?

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.756
And it turns out it's fairly complicated.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.996
Factors such as your diet,
your medications, your lifestyle

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.036
all factor into the way you smell.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.596
And I found that our sweat
is mostly odorless,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.755
but it's our bacteria and microbiome

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.516
that's responsible for your smells,
your mood, your identity

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.156
and so much beyond.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.476
And there's all kinds
of molecules that you emit

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.780
but which we only perceive subconsciously.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.276
So I've been cataloging and collecting

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.476
bacteria from different sites of my body.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.476
After talking to a scientist, we thought,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.196
maybe the perfect concoction of Ani

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.196
is like 10 percent collarbone,
30 percent underarm,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.516
40 percent bikini line and so forth,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.596
and occasionally
I let researchers from other labs

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.276
take a sniff of my samples.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.476
And it's been interesting to hear
how smell of the body

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.316
is perceived outside
of the context of the body.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.916
I've gotten feedback such as,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.396
smells like flowers, like chicken,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.636
like cornflakes,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.116
like beef carnitas.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.036
(Laughter)

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.676
At the same time, I cultivate
a set of carnivorous plants

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.356
for their ability to emit
fleshlike odors to attract prey,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.196
in an attempt to kind of create
this symbiotic relationship

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.140
between my bacteria and this organism.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.996
And as it so happens,
I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.316
and I was talking to a scientist

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.716
who happens to be a chemist
and a plant scientist,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.636
and I was telling him about my project,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.796
and he was like, "Well, this sounds
like botany for lonely women."

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.836
(Laughter)

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.756
Unperturbed, I said, "OK."

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.996
I challenged him.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.316
"Can we engineer a plant
that can love me back?"

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.796
And for some reason,
he was like, "Sure, why not?"

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.756
So we started with,
can we get a plant to grow towards me

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.236
like I was the sun?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.196
And so we're looking at mechanisms
in plants such as phototropism,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.396
which causes the plant
to grow towards the sun

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.396
by producing hormones like auxin,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.076
which causes cell elongation
on the shady side.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.236
And right now I'm creating
a set of lipsticks

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.076
that are infused with these chemicals

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.756
that allow me to interact with a plant
on its own chemical signatures --

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.196
lipsticks that cause plants
to grow where I kiss it,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.956
plants that blossom
where I kiss the bloom.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.756
And through these projects,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.196
I'm asking questions like,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.916
how do we define nature?

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.476
How do we define nature
when we can reengineer its properties,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.916
and when should we do it?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.636
Should we do it for profit, for utility?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.356
Can we do it for emotional ends?

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.956
Can biotechnology be used
to create work as moving as music?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.876
What are the thresholds between science

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.740
and its ability to shape
our emotional landscape?

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.236
It's a famous design mantra
that form follows function.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.316
Well, now, wedged somewhere
between science, design and art

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.556
I get to ask,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.036
what if fiction informs fact?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.116
What kind of R&amp;D lab would that look like

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.756
and what kind of questions
would we ask together?

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.116
We often look to technology as the answer,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.676
but as an artist and designer,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.196
I like to ask, but what is the question?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.436
Thank you.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.820
(Applause)
