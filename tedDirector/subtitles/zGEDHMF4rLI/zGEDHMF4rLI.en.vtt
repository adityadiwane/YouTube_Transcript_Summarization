00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I'm here today, as June said,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
to talk about a project

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
We're crocheting a coral reef.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
And it's a project that we've actually

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
have actually been involved in this project,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
in many of its different aspects.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
It's a project that now reaches across three continents,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
marine biology, feminine handicraft

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
and environmental activism.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
It's true.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
It's also a project

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
that in a very beautiful way,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
the development of this

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
right here in February 2009 --

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
which, as one of our previous speakers told us,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
is the 200th anniversary

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
of the birth of Charles Darwin.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
But let me first begin by showing you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
some pictures of what this thing looks like.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Just to give you an idea of scale,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
that installation there is about six feet across,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
This is some more images of it.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
That one on the right is about five feet high.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
have contributed all over the world as part of this.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
The totality of this project

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
involves tens of thousands of hours

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
of human labor --

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
99 percent of it done by women.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
that is about 12 feet long.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
My sister and I started this project in 2005

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
because in that year, at least in the science press,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
there was a lot of talk about global warming,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Corals are very delicate organisms,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
It causes these vast bleaching events

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
that are the first signs of corals of being sick.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And if the bleaching doesn't go away --

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
particularly in coral reefs all over the world.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
which is a little organization we started

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
to promote, to do projects about the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
asking for people to join us in this enterprise.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
To our surprise, one of the first people who called

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
was the Andy Warhol Museum.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
And they said they were having an exhibition

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
about artists' response to global warming,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
you can have a little bit of it."

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
So in 2007 we had an exhibition,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
a small exhibition of this crochet reef.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and we want you to fill it with your reef."

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Now I say "naively" because actually

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
my profession is as a science writer.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
I've written books about the history of space,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
the history of physics and religion,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.330
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
So I said yes to this proposition.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And she nearly had a fit

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
because Christine is a professor at one of

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
She thought I'd gone off my head.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
But she went into crochet overdrive.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
And to cut a long story short, eight months later

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
3,000 square foot gallery.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
By this stage the project had taken on

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
a viral dimension of its own,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
which got completely beyond us.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
The people in Chicago decided

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
was have the local people there make a reef.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
And it was exhibited alongside ours.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
There were hundreds of people involved in that.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
We got invited to do the whole thing

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
in New York, and in London,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and in Los Angeles.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
In each of these cities, the local citizens,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
And more and more people get involved in this,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
most of whom we've never met.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
So the whole thing has sort of morphed

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
into this organic, ever-evolving creature,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Now some of you are sitting here thinking,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
"What planet are these people on?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
two concepts that go together.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Cast it in bronze."

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
But it turns out there is a very good reason

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
why we are crocheting it

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
because many organisms in coral reefs

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
have a very particular kind of structure.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
The frilly crenulated forms that you see

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
And the only way that mathematicians know

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
how to model this structure

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
So what is this hyperbolic geometry

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
that corals and sea slugs embody?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
to the level of a sea slug.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.330
(Laughter)

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
when it was first discovered in the 19th century.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
how they could model it.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
In 1997 a mathematician

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
at Cornell, Daina Taimina,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
made the discovery that this structure

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
could actually be done in knitting and crochet.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
The first one she did was knitting.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
crochet was the better thing.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
But what she was doing was actually making a model

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
had thought it was actually impossible to model.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
was impossible per se.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
trying to prove that this structure was impossible.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
about two kinds of space:

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
Euclidean space, and spherical space.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
And they have different properties.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.330
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
And what they do is, they do it through the concept

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
of parallel lines.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
So here we have a line and a point outside the line.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
the point but never meet the original line?"

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
One. Great. Okay.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
That's our definition of a parallel line.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
It's a definition really of Euclidean space.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
But there is another possibility that you all know of:

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
spherical space.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
Think of the surface of a sphere --

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
can I draw through the point

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
but never meet the original line?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
What do we mean to talk about

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
a straight line on a curved surface?

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Now mathematicians have answered that question.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
They've understood there is a generalized concept

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
of straightness, it's called a geodesic.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
And on the surface of a sphere,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.330
So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
So we ask the question again,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
but never meet the original line?"

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
Does someone want to guess?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Zero. Very good.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
Zero and one.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
To a mathematician if there are two answers,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
and the first two are zero and one,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
there is another number that immediately suggests itself

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
as the third alternative.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Does anyone want to guess what it is?

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
There is, there's a third alternative.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
This is what it looks like.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
that go through the point and never meet the original line.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
This is the drawing.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
flat surface.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
Mathematicians for several hundred years

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
had to really struggle with this.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
How could they see this?

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
What did it mean to actually have a physical model

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
that looked like this?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Then our mathematicians come along

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
and said, "There's this thing called a sphere,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
and the lines come together at the north and south pole."

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
But you don't know what a sphere looks like.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
And someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
I can touch it. I can play with it."

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
And that's exactly what happened

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
when Daina Taimina

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
in 1997, showed that you could crochet models

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
in hyperbolic space.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
Here is this diagram in crochetness.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
And the lines look curved.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
But look, I can prove to you that they're straight

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
because I can take any one of these lines,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
and I can fold along it.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
And it's a straight line.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
So here, in wool,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
through a domestic feminine art,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
is the proof that the most famous postulate

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
in mathematics is wrong.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:14.330
(Applause)

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
theorems onto these surfaces.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
that is called non-Euclidean geometry.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
And this is actually the field of mathematics

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
that underlies general relativity

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
and is actually ultimately going to show us

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
about the shape of the universe.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
So there is this direct line

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
between feminine handicraft,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
Euclid and general relativity.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate --

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
didn't know it was impossible to violate,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
and they're simply getting on with it.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.330
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
I once asked the mathematicians why it was

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
Their answer was interesting.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
sitting around looking at sea slugs."

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It also says a whole lot of things

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
about what mathematicians thought mathematics was,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
what they thought it could and couldn't do,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
what they thought it could and couldn't represent.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
Even mathematicians, who in some sense

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
are the freest of all thinkers,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
literally couldn't see

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
not only the sea slugs around them,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
but the lettuce on their plate --

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
And so in some sense they literally,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
they had such a symbolic view of mathematics,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
they couldn't actually see what was going on

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
on the lettuce in front of them.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.330
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
And so, too, we've discovered

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
that there is an infinite taxonomy

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
of crochet hyperbolic creatures.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
doing the simple mathematically perfect models.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
But we found that when we deviated from the specific

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
setness of the mathematical code

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
that underlies it -- the simple algorithm

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
crochet three, increase one --

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
the models immediately started to look more natural.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
collection of people around the world,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
do their own embellishments.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
As it were, we have this ever-evolving,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
crochet taxonomic tree of life.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
Just as the morphology

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
and the complexity of life on earth is never ending,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
little embellishments and complexifications

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
in the DNA code

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids --

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
lead to new and wondrous creatures

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
So this project really has

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
taken on this inner organic life of its own.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
And their individual visions,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
and their engagement with this mathematical mode.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
We have these technologies. We use them.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
is that these things suggest

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
the importance and value of embodied knowledge.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
We live in a society

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
that completely tends to valorize

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
symbolic forms of representation --

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
algebraic representations,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
equations, codes.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
We live in a society that's obsessed

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
with presenting information in this way,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
teaching information in this way.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
But through this sort of modality,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.330
crochet, other plastic forms of play --

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
people can be engaged with the most abstract,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
high-powered, theoretical ideas,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
to university departments to study in higher mathematics,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.330
But you can do it through playing with material objects.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
One of the ways that we've come to think about this

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
and projects like this, we're trying to have

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
kindergarten for grown-ups.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
system of education,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
established by a man named Friedrich Froebel,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
He believed that the crystal was the model

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
for all kinds of representation.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
He developed a radical alternative system

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
of engaging the smallest children

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
with the most abstract ideas

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
through physical forms of play.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
The value of education

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
is something that Froebel championed,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
through plastic modes of play.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
We live in a society now

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
where we have lots of think tanks,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
where great minds go to think about the world.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
They write these great symbolic treatises

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
called books, and papers,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
and op-ed articles.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
We want to propose, Chrissy and I,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
which is the play tank.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
And the play tank, like the think tank,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
is a place where people can go

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
and engage with great ideas.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
But what we want to propose,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
is that the highest levels of abstraction,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. --

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
all of this can be engaged with,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
not just through purely cerebral algebraic

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
symbolic methods,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.330
but by literally, physically playing with ideas.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
Thank you very much.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.330
(Applause)
