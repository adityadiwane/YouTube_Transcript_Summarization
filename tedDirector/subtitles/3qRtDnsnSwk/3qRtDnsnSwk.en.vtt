00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
(Applause)

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
These Gapminder bubbles show you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
or how we estimate that it was.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
What we are showing here is --

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.160
on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
that shows how many are infected in each country,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
and the color is the continent.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
Now, you can see United States, in 1983,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
had a very low percentage infected,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
There were quite many people infected in the United States.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And, up there, you see Uganda.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
They had almost five percent infected,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.160
And they were probably the most infected country in the world.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Now, what has happened?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Now you have understood the graph

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
and now, in the next 60 seconds,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
But first, I have a new invention here.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
(Laughter)

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
(Laughter)

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
(Applause)

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
So, ready, steady, go!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
They went upwards like this.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
they reached one to two percent.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Then, Uganda started to turn back,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Look, India got many infected,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
but had a low level.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And almost the same happens here.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Russia went to one percent.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
In the last two to three years,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
25 years it took.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
it's just that they have stopped getting worse.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And it has -- the steady state is, more or less,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
It means 30 to 40 million people,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
the whole of California -- every person,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
that's more or less what we have today in the world.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
democratic government, good economy,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
and this is what happened there.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
They started low, they skyrocketed,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
they peaked up there in 2003,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
and now they are down.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
But they are falling only slowly,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
they can manage to treat people.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
These percentages won't come down

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
because people can survive 10 to 20 years.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
So there's some problem with these metrics now.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.160
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
because people still die.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
all people are not reached by treatment,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It's not realistic with lifelong treatment

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
for everyone in the poorest countries.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
But it's very good that what is done is being done.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.160
But focus now is back on prevention.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
It is only by stopping the transmission

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
that the world will be able to deal with it.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
but the drugs are very costly for the poor.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Not the drug in itself, but the treatment

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
and the care which is needed around it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
So, when we look at the pattern,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
one thing comes out very clearly:

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
you see the blue bubbles

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
and people say HIV is very high in Africa.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
in African countries,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
the same rate as United States.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
And you'll find Madagascar,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
and you'll find a lot of African countries

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
about as low as the rest of the world.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
and things go on in one way in Africa.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
We have to stop that.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
to think that way.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
(Applause)

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
(Laughter)

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
So, why is it so high? Is it war?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
No, it's not. Look here.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
they have two, three percent infected,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
There are now studies clearly showing

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
So, is it poverty?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Well if you look at the macro level,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
it seems more money, more HIV.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
But that's very simplistic,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
so let's go down and look at Tanzania.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I will split Tanzania in five income groups,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
from the highest income to the lowest income,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
and here we go.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
they have higher HIV.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
and it is even bigger among women.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
done by African institutions and researchers

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Look here at Kenya.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
I've split Kenya in its provinces.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Here it goes.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
See the difference within one African country --

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
it goes from very low level to very high level,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
So, what is it then?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Well, it is more common with multiple partners,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
there is less condom use,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and there is age-disparate sex --

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
in many of these highly affected countries.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
But where are they situated?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
I will swap the bubbles to a map.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
HIV exists all over the world.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Brazil has many HIV-infected.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
India has many because they are many.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Southeast Asia, and so on.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
But, there is one part of Africa --

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
and the difficult thing is, at the same time,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
not to make a uniform statement about Africa,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.160
not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
UNAIDS have done good data available, finally,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
about the spread of HIV.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
It could be concurrency.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
It could be some virus types.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
It could be that there is other things

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.160
the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
behave tonight and so on.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
(Laughter)

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
But what we think is that it could be concurrency.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And what is concurrency?

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
We have serial monogamy.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And you collect a big number of exes.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic --

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
is much more dangerous for HIV than others.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Probably, it's a combination of this.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
towards fact when we look at this.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
You can get this chart, free.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
we will not only have the heart,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
we will not only have the money,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
but we will also use the brain.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Thank you very much.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.160
(Applause)
