00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.056
15 years ago, I volunteered
to participate in a research study

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.616
that involved a genetic test.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.647
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.320
I was handed a questionnaire.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.296
One of the very first questions
asked me to check a box for my race:

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.920
White, black, Asian, or Native American.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.560
I wasn't quite sure
how to answer the question.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.576
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.176
of research participants'
social backgrounds?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.816
In that case, I would answer
with my social identity,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
and check the box for "black."

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.016
But what if the researchers
were interested in investigating

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.136
some association between ancestry
and the risk for certain genetic traits?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.696
In that case, wouldn't they want to know
something about my ancestry,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.976
which is just as much European as African?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.616
And how could they make
scientific findings about my genes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.680
if I put down my social identity
as a black woman?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.616
After all, I consider myself
a black woman with a white father

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.056
rather than a white woman
with a black mother

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.360
entirely for social reasons.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.256
Which racial identity I check

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120
has nothing to do with my genes.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.456
Well, despite the obvious
importance of this question

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.976
to the study's scientific validity,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.536
I was told, "Don't worry about it,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440
just put down however
you identify yourself."

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.576
So I check "black,"

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.296
but I had no confidence
in the results of a study

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.520
that treated a critical variable
so unscientifically.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.696
That personal experience
with the use of race in genetic testing

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.296
got me thinking:

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.040
Where else in medicine is race used
to make false biological predictions?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.976
Well, I found out that race runs deeply
throughout all of medical practice.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.015
It shapes physicians' diagnoses,

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.656
measurements, treatments,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.296
prescriptions,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.480
even the very definition of diseases.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.360
And the more I found out,
the more disturbed I became.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.816
Sociologists like me have long explained

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.736
that race is a social construction.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.256
When we identify people as black,
white, Asian, Native American, Latina,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.016
we're referring to social groupings

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.736
with made up demarcations
that have changed over time

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.296
and vary around the world.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.536
As a legal scholar, I've also studied

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.976
how lawmakers, not biologists,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.840
have invented the legal
definitions of races.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.096
And it's not just the view
of social scientists.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.736
You remember when the map
of the human genome

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.016
was unveiled at a White House
ceremony in June 2000?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.656
President Bill Clinton famously declared,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.856
"I believe one of the great truths

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.056
to emerge from this triumphant expedition

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.896
inside the human genome

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.776
is that in genetic terms,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.616
human beings, regardless of race,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.160
are more than 99.9 percent the same."

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.496
And he might have added

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.216
that that less than one percent
of genetic difference

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.760
doesn't fall into racial boxes.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.096
Francis Collins, who led
the Human Genome Project

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.816
and now heads NIH,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.896
echoed President Clinton.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.856
"I am happy that today,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.720
the only race we're talking about
is the human race."

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.376
Doctors are supposed to practice
evidence-based medicine,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.336
and they're increasingly called
to join the genomic revolution.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.240
But their habit of treating patients
by race lags far behind.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.416
Take the estimate

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.696
of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.256
Doctors routinely interpret GFR,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.520
this important indicator
of kidney function, by race.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.079
As you can see in this lab test,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.896
the exact same creatinine level,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.696
the concentration
in the blood of the patient,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.176
automatically produces
a different GFR estimate

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.680
depending on whether or not
the patient is African-American.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.320
Why?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.536
I've been told it's based on an assumption

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.656
that African-Americans
have more muscle mass

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.880
than people of other races.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.696
But what sense does it make

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.176
for a doctor to automatically assume

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.080
I have more muscle mass
than that female bodybuilder?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.576
Wouldn't it be far more accurate
and evidence-based

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.616
to determine the muscle mass
of individual patients

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.680
just by looking at them?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.776
Well, doctors tell me
they're using race as a shortcut.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.536
It's a crude but convenient proxy

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.816
for more important factors,
like muscle mass,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.216
enzyme level, genetic traits

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.520
they just don't have time to look for.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.376
But race is a bad proxy.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.536
In many cases, race adds
no relevant information at all.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.440
It's just a distraction.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.480
But race also tends to overwhelm
the clinical measures.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.120
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.440
family illnesses,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.776
their history, their own illnesses
they might have --

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.320
all more evidence-based
than the patient's race.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.696
Race can't substitute
for these important clinical measures

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.400
without sacrificing patient well-being.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.456
Doctors also tell me
race is just one of many factors

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.016
they take into account,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.176
but there are numerous medical tests,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.936
like the GFR,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.216
that use race categorically

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.216
to treat black, white,
Asian patients differently

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.320
just because of their race.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.176
Race medicine also leaves
patients of color especially vulnerable

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.000
to harmful biases and stereotypes.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.896
Black and Latino patients
are twice as likely

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.416
to receive no pain medication as whites

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.016
for the same painful long bone fractures

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.256
because of stereotypes

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.136
that black and brown people
feel less pain,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.096
exaggerate their pain,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.840
and are predisposed to drug addiction.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.976
The Food and Drug Administration has even
approved a race-specific medicine.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.416
It's a pill called BiDil

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.080
to treat heart failure in self-identified
African-American patients.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.816
A cardiologist developed this drug
without regard to race or genetics,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.096
but it became convenient

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.016
for commercial reasons

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.760
to market the drug to black patients.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.616
The FDA then allowed

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.696
the company, the drug company,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.336
to test the efficacy in a clinical trial

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.920
that only included
African-American subjects.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.536
It speculated

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.656
that race stood in as a proxy
for some unknown genetic factor

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.456
that affects heart disease

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.240
or response to drugs.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.016
But think about
the dangerous message it sent,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.496
that black people's bodies
are so substandard,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.216
a drug tested in them

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.720
is not guaranteed
to work in other patients.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.656
In the end, the drug company's
marketing scheme failed.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.656
For one thing, black patients
were understandably wary

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.056
of using a drug just for black people.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.016
One elderly black woman stood up
in a community meeting and shouted,

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.496
"Give me what the white
people are taking!"

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.000
(Laughter)

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:51.360
And if you find race-specific
medicine surprising,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.135
wait until you learn

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.976
that many doctors in the United States

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.136
still use an updated version

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.056
of a diagnostic tool

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.536
that was developed by a physician
during the slavery era,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.856
a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.240
to justifications for slavery.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.216
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.616
from the University
of Pennsylvania Medical School.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.216
He practiced in the Deep South
before the Civil War,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.360
and he was a well-known expert
on what was then called "Negro medicine."

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.336
He promoted the racial concept of disease,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.056
that people of different races
suffer from different diseases

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.720
and experience
common diseases differently.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.136
Cartwright argued in the 1850s

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.176
that slavery was beneficial
for black people

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.256
for medical reasons.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.176
He claimed that because black people
have lower lung capacity than whites,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.760
forced labor was good for them.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.096
He wrote in a medical journal,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.536
"It is the red vital blood
sent to the brain

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.896
that liberates their minds
when under the white man's control,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.656
and it is the want of sufficiency
of red vital blood

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.080
that chains their minds to ignorance
and barbarism when in freedom."

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.296
To support this theory,
Cartwright helped to perfect

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.160
a medical device for measuring breathing
called the spirometer

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.280
to show the presumed deficiency
in black people's lungs.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.416
Today, doctors still
uphold Cartwright's claim

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.056
the black people as a race

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.080
have lower lung capacity
than white people.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.576
Some even use a modern day spirometer

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.336
that actually has a button labeled "race"

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.016
so the machine adjusts the measurement

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.016
for each patient
according to his or her race.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.880
It's a well-known function
called "correcting for race."

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.360
The problem with race medicine
extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.376
Its focus on innate
racial differences in disease

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.496
diverts attention and resources

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.736
from the social determinants

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.736
that cause appalling
racial gaps in health:

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.080
lack of access
to high-quality medical care;

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.400
food deserts in poor neighborhoods;

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.440
exposure to environmental toxins;

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.280
high rates of incarceration;

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.280
and experiencing the stress
of racial discrimination.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.896
You see, race is not a biological category

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.336
that naturally produces
these health disparities

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.600
because of genetic difference.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.856
Race is a social category

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.536
that has staggering
biological consequences,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.480
but because of the impact
of social inequality on people's health.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.296
Yet race medicine pretends
the answer to these gaps in health

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.536
can be found in a race-specific pill.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.296
It's much easier and more lucrative

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.080
to market a technological fix

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.816
for these gaps in health

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.640
than to deal with the structural
inequities that produce them.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.296
The reason I'm so passionate
about ending race medicine

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.376
isn't just because it's bad medicine.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.256
I'm also on this mission

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.216
because the way doctors practice medicine

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.880
continues to promote
a false and toxic view of humanity.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.936
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs
in medicine we've been learning about,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.576
there's a failure of imagination

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.320
when it comes to race.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.840
Would you imagine with me, just a moment:

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.720
What would happen if doctors
stopped treating patients by race?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.896
Suppose they rejected

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.616
an 18th-century classification system

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.376
and incorporated instead
the most advanced knowledge

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.336
of human genetic diversity and unity,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.520
that human beings cannot be categorized
into biological races?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.376
What if, instead of using race
as a crude proxy

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.776
for some more important factor,

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.920
doctors actually investigated
and addressed that more important factor?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.856
What if doctors joined the forefront

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.616
of a movement to end
the structural inequities

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.856
caused by racism,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.960
not by genetic difference?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.520
Race medicine is bad medicine,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.296
it's poor science

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.680
and it's a false
interpretation of humanity.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.096
It is more urgent than ever

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.656
to finally abandon this backward legacy

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.096
and to affirm our common humanity

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.016
by ending the social inequalities
that truly divide us.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.256
Thank you.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.496
(Applause)

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.400
Thank you. Thanks.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.520
Thank you.
