00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.261
When I was only three or four,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.753
I fell in love with poetry,

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.888
with the rhythms
and the music of language;

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:24.555
with the power of metaphor and of imagery,

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.341
poetry being the essence
of communication --

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:30.072
the discipline, the distillation.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.961
And all these years later,
the poems I'll read today

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:37.286
are from my just-finished
seventh book of poetry.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.326
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease.

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:44.794
Though there's no cure yet,

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:47.604
advances in treatment
are really impressive.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.975
But you can imagine
that I was appalled to learn

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.493
that women are largely
left out of research trials,

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:59.038
despite gender-specific
medical findings having demonstrated

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:01.721
that we are not actually just small men --

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:03.842
(Laughter)

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.118
who happen to have
different reproductive systems.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.971
Gender-specific medicine
is good for men, too.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:15.078
But you bring to a crisis
the person you already are,

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:18.975
including the, yes, momentum
that you've learned to invoke

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.308
through passionate caring
and through action,

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:26.700
both of which require
but also create energy.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.756
So as an activist, I began working
with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.961
that's pdf.org --

00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:40.724
to create a major initiative to put women
on the Parkinson's disease map.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.044
And as a poet, I began working
with this subject matter,

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:49.792
finding it tragic, hilarious,
sometimes even joyful.

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:52.723
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:55.372
I feel distilled by it,

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:59.834
and I actually very much
like the woman I'm distilling into.

00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:03.429
"No Signs of Struggle"

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.619
Growing small requires enormity of will:

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.231
just sitting still
in the doctor's waiting room

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:14.841
watching the future shuffle in and out,

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:17.608
watching it stoop; stare at you

00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:19.594
while you try not to look.

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:21.856
Rare is an exchange:

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.023
a smile of brief, wry recognition.

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.716
You are the new kid on the block.

00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:30.352
Everyone here was you once.

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:34.998
You are still learning that growing small
requires a largeness of spirit

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:37.481
you can't fit into yet:

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:41.454
acceptance of irritating help
from those who love you;

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:44.562
giving way and over, but not up.

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:48.722
You've swallowed hard the contents
of the "Drink Me" bottle,

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:50.931
and felt yourself shrink.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.319
Now, familiar furniture looms,

00:02:54.343 --> 00:02:59.129
floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only
when wrestled round with both hands.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:04.555
It demands colossal patience,
all this growing small:

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.475
your diminished sleep at night,

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.928
your handwriting, your voice, your height.

00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:13.893
You are more the incredible
shrinking woman

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:17.840
than the Buddhist mystic,
serene, making do with less.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.645
Less is not always more.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.140
Yet in this emptying space,
space glimmers,

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.798
becoming visible.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:31.474
Here is a place behind the eyes
of those accustomed

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:34.767
by what some would call diminishment.

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:39.143
It is a place of merciless poetry,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.486
a gift of presence previously ignored,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.579
drowned in the daily clutter.

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:48.438
Here every gesture needs intention,

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.468
is alive with consciousness.

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.346
Nothing is automatic.

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.661
You can spot it
in the provocation of a button,

00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:58.898
an arm poking at a sleeve,

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:03.271
a balancing act at a night-time curb
while negotiating the dark.

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.167
Feats of such modest valor,

00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:12.495
who would suspect them to be exercises
in an intimate, fierce discipline,

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.820
a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.452
Such understated power here,

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:23.764
in these tottering dancers
who exert stupendous effort

00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:26.874
on tasks most view as insignificant.

00:04:27.572 --> 00:04:30.913
Such quiet beauty here, in these,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:35.210
my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:38.932
such resolve masked by each placid face.

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:44.530
There is immensity required
in growing small,

00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:47.565
so bent on such unbending grace.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.319
(Applause)

00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:55.921
Thank you.

00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:59.128
This one is called
"On Donating My Brain to Science."

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:00.344
(Laughter)

00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:02.254
Not a problem.

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.862
Skip over all the pages
reassuring religious people.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.036
Already a universal donor:
kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.282
tissue, heart, veins, whatever.

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:19.575
Odd that the modest brain never
imagined its unique value in research,

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.913
maybe saving someone else from what it is
they're not quite sure I have.

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:25.170
Flattering, that.

00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:27.818
So fill in the forms,

00:05:27.842 --> 00:05:29.701
drill through the answers,

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:31.688
trill out a blithe spirit.

00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:36.000
And slice me, dice me,
spread me on your slides.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.666
Find what I'm trying to tell you.

00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:43.991
Earn me, learn me, scan me,
squint through your lens.

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:46.694
Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.

00:05:46.718 --> 00:05:51.182
Be my guest, do your best,
harvest me, track the clues.

00:05:51.206 --> 00:05:53.680
This was a good brain while alive.

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:56.060
This was a brain that paid its dues.

00:05:56.084 --> 00:06:00.975
So slice me, dice me,
smear me on your slides,

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.520
stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.620
Share me, hear me:

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:09.244
I want to be used
I want to be used

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.314
I want to be used
up.

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:14.933
(Applause)

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:21.260
(Applause ends)

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.531
And this one's called "The Ghost Light."

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.779
Lit from within is the sole secure way

00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:31.797
to traverse dark matter.

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:37.421
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms,
snails, jellyfish, worms --

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.717
glow bioluminescent,

00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.510
and people as well;

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:45.786
we emit infra-red light
from our most lucent selves.

00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:49.602
Our tragedy is we can't see it.

00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:52.258
We see by reflecting.

00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:56.701
We need biofluorescence
to show our true colors.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.503
External illumination can distort, though.

00:07:00.527 --> 00:07:02.529
When gravity bends light,

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:06.162
huge galaxy clusters
can act as telescopes,

00:07:06.186 --> 00:07:11.363
elongating background images
of star systems to faint arcs --

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:12.541
a lensing effect

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:16.508
like viewing distant street lamps
through a glass of wine.

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:20.242
A glass of wine or two now makes me weave

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:23.128
as if acting the drunkard's part;

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:26.498
as if, besotted with unrequited love

00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:30.607
for the dynamic Turner canvasses
spied out by the Hubble,

00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:32.912
I could lurch down a city street set

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:36.855
without provoking
every pedestrian walk-on stare.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.924
Stare as long as you need to.

00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:45.841
If you think about it, walking,
even standing, is illogical --

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.841
such tiny things, feet! --

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:49.782
(Laughter)

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:53.717
especially when one's body
is not al dente anymore.

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:57.327
(Laughter)

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:00.851
Besides, creature of extremes and excess,

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:03.911
I've always thought Apollo
beautiful but boring,

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:05.919
and a bit of a dumb blonde.

00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.748
Dionysians don't do balance.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:14.574
Balance, in other words,
has never been my strong point.

00:08:15.104 --> 00:08:16.272
But I digress.

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.511
More and more these days,

00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:20.533
digression seems
the most direct route through

00:08:20.557 --> 00:08:22.634
from where I've lost or found myself

00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:26.349
out of place, mind, turn, time.

00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:31.558
Place your foot just so,
mind how you turn:

00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:34.359
too swift a swivel can bring you down.

00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:38.134
Take your time ushering the audience out,

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:40.190
saying goodbye to the actors.

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:42.199
The ghost light

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.009
is what they call the single bulb

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:47.634
hanging above the bare stage
in an empty theater.

00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:50.968
In the empty theater of such a night,

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:54.810
waking to meet no external radiance,

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:58.026
this is the final struggle left to win,

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.285
this the sole beacon
to beckon the darkness in

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:03.954
and let the rest begin,

00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:08.931
this the lens through which at last
to see both Self and Other

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:13.575
arrayed with the bright stain
of original sin:

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:15.051
lit from within.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.825
(Applause)

00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:26.107
And this is the last one.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.103
"This Dark Hour"

00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:32.028
Late summer, 4 A.M.

00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:35.020
The rain slows to a stop,

00:09:35.044 --> 00:09:37.292
dripping still from the broad leaves

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:40.503
of blue hostas unseen
in the garden's dark.

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:44.953
Barefoot, careful
on the slick slate slabs,

00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:48.260
I need no light, I know the way,

00:09:48.284 --> 00:09:50.163
stoop by the mint bed,

00:09:50.187 --> 00:09:52.992
scoop a fistful of moist earth,

00:09:53.016 --> 00:09:54.724
then grope for a chair,

00:09:54.748 --> 00:09:57.402
spread a shawl, and sit,

00:09:57.426 --> 00:10:01.184
breathing in the wet green August air.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.230
This is the small, still hour

00:10:05.254 --> 00:10:09.068
before the newspaper
lands in the vestibule like a grenade,

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:13.663
the phone shrills, the computer screen
blinks and glares awake.

00:10:14.643 --> 00:10:16.823
There is this hour:

00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:20.823
poem in my head, soil in my hand:

00:10:20.847 --> 00:10:22.793
unnamable fullness.

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:26.245
This hour, when blood of my blood

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:30.301
bone of bone, child grown
to manhood now --

00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:35.789
stranger, intimate,
not distant but apart --

00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:39.547
lies safe, off dreaming melodies

00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:43.100
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.

00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:46.340
To have come to this place,

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:48.455
lived to this moment:

00:10:48.479 --> 00:10:50.594
immeasurable lightness.

00:10:51.392 --> 00:10:54.313
The density of black starts to blur umber.

00:10:54.789 --> 00:10:57.767
Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.802
then the mourning dove's elegy.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.780
Sable glimmers toward grey;

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:05.972
objects emerge, trailing shadows;

00:11:05.996 --> 00:11:07.971
night ages toward day.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.006
The city stirs.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.858
There will be other dawns,
nights, gaudy noons.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.417
Likely, I'll lose my way.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.272
There will be stumbling, falling,

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:21.537
cursing the dark.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.110
Whatever comes,

00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:28.081
there was this hour when nothing mattered,

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:30.786
all was unbearably dear.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.116
And when I'm done with daylights,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.101
should those who loved me
grieve too long a while,

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.354
let them remember that I had this hour --

00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:45.986
this dark, perfect hour --

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.412
and smile.

00:11:48.418 --> 00:11:49.572
Thank you.

00:11:49.596 --> 00:11:55.948
(Applause)
