00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:14.792
It's funny the things you forget.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.499
I went to see my mother the other day,
and she told me this story

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:21.691
that I'd completely
forgotten about

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:25.101
how, when we were driving together,
she would pull the car over,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.281
and by the time she had
gotten out of the car,

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:29.749
and gone around the car
to let me out of the car,

00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:31.851
I would have already gotten out of the car

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.114
and pretended to have died.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:37.084
(Laughter)

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:41.456
(Applause)

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:48.903
Because that's how you die.

00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:50.860
(Laughter)

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.987
And I remember, that was a game
I used to play with myself

00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:57.407
to entertain myself whenever
I was bored or frustrated.

00:00:58.174 --> 00:00:59.570
(Laughter)

00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:01.516
Settle down.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.533
(Laughter)

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.817
People say we live in an age
of information overload. Right?

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.005
I don't know about that,

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.592
but I just know that I get
too many marketing emails.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.065
I got a marketing email
from a supermarket firm,

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:14.898
which will remain nameless

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.868
for predominantly legal reasons,

00:01:16.892 --> 00:01:19.373
but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.455
(Laughter)

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.677
I got an email from them,
and it went like this, it said:

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.942
"Just three weeks until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.378
And I resented this,

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:34.573
because not only do I not remember
signing up to that,

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:37.309
but I resent the fact
that they appear to think

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.475
that I should be excited
about a shop opening.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.244
So what I did was I scrolled down
to the bottom of the email,

00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:45.825
and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:48.071
And I thought that'd be the end of it.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:50.251
But a week later,
I got another one that said,

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:51.713
"Just two weeks

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:54.579
until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:57.230
And I thought, obviously,
I haven't clicked hard enough.

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:59.143
So I tried it again. Right?

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.739
Lo and behold, a week passes,
you guessed it,

00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:06.820
"Just one week until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:08.686
And here's the problem:

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.032
The internet gave us access to everything;

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.193
but it also gave everything access to us.

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.750
It's hard enough to discriminate

00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:19.329
between the things that genuinely
matter in this world

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:20.877
and the minutiae of life,

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:23.576
without having emails
about supermarket chains

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.043
and Candy Crush Saga.

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.403
And I was really annoyed with them,

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:31.605
and I thought, OK, I was about to write
a strongly worded email,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.890
which I can do quite well.

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:34.707
(Laughter)

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.366
And I thought, no --

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.948
I'm going to find the game.

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:41.081
So I replied to it, and I said,

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:42.905
"I literally cannot wait!!!!"

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.455
(Laughter)

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:48.693
"What do you need from me?"

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:53.211
They got back to me;
a guy called Dan said,

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:56.149
"Hi James. I've asked a colleague
to help me with your query."

00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:57.193
(Laughter)

00:02:57.217 --> 00:02:58.849
Like it needs help.

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:02.119
And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:04.436
I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.655
(Laughter)

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:09.751
"I'm not sure what you mean."

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:10.982
(Laughter)

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:14.309
I said, "I'm just tremendously
excited about the opening!"

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.768
(Laughter)

00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:20.891
"Do you want to book
the bouncy castle or shall I?"

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.839
He said, "I think you have misunderstood."

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:27.378
(Laughter)

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:30.393
"A new store is opening,
but there is no celebration planned."

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.579
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks
until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?

00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:37.742
I was getting excited."

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.249
(Laughter)

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:41.850
"I'm sorry you're disappointed."

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:43.874
(Laughter)

00:03:45.694 --> 00:03:47.029
I said, "Not to worry.

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:50.989
Let's do something anyway!

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.369
Besides, the deposit on the bouncy
castle was non-refundable."

00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:56.497
(Laughter)

00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:01.632
"If we don't use it, we're out
a few hundred quid, Dan."

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:03.346
(Laughter)

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:08.249
He said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible
for anything you have ordered."

00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:12.778
I said, "Let's not get into who did what.

00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:16.811
Bottom line: you and I
are in this together."

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.079
(Laughter)

00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:20.733
(Applause)

00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:26.830
"Question: Will you be there
to make sure people take their shoes off?"

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:28.980
(Laughter)

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:34.875
I'll be honest, then my relationship
with Dan deteriorated somewhat,

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.224
because the next email I got was this:

00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:39.630
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.654
(Laughter)

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.132
That's outrageous.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.307
I said, "Dan?"

00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:46.171
(Laughter)

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:49.117
And I got -- and I was just like,
this is ... -- and I, I ....

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:50.937
And I said, "Danny?"

00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:56.023
And I thought, this is terrible.
All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.

00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:57.594
I said, "D-Dog?"

00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:59.444
(Laughter)

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.326
"The store is now open."

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.350
(Laughter)

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:09.618
I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered
why there was no bouncy castle."

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:12.896
And then we were back to this.

00:05:15.123 --> 00:05:17.730
And that might have been
the end of the story,

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:21.806
but I remembered
that anything -- everything --

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.402
even something as mundane
as getting out of a car,

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:27.352
can be fun if you find the right game.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:30.626
So,

00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:33.253
this is what I replied:

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:36.670
[Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is #0000001.]

00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:38.980
(Laughter)

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:42.339
(Applause)

00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:46.238
And we just, uh ...

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.263
(Laughter)

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:50.440
It was like we were dancing.

00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:52.707
It was just a beautiful relationship.

00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.126
We just kept going.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.592
It was lovely.

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:59.501
But to be honest, guys,
it was quite labor-intensive,

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.570
and I had other stuff to do,

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:03.983
believe it or not.

00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:10.991
So what I did is I have a little email
auto-replier program.

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:15.493
And I set it up so every time
it receives an email from SafeMart,

00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:16.667
it just pings one back.

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:18.042
So I set it up, and it says,

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.427
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.305
Then it has a little formula that I wrote
to up the case number every time.

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:25.614
And I put it on the server

00:06:26.455 --> 00:06:27.820
and set it running.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.446
(Laughter)

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.075
I'll be honest, guys --

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.495
then I forgot about it.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.519
(Laughter)

00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:42.592
I checked back on it the other day,

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:48.899
and it appears there have been
a number of emails going back and forth.

00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:52.646
We're on 21,439.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.852
(Applause)

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.304
It gives me an immense
sense of satisfaction to know

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:06.249
that these computer programs
are just going to be pinging one another

00:07:06.273 --> 00:07:07.742
for eternity.

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:11.271
And as legacies go,
I don't think that's bad.

00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:15.383
So guys, just remember:

00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:18.860
if ever you feel weighed down
by the bureaucracy

00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:21.025
and often mundanity of modern life,

00:07:22.073 --> 00:07:23.898
don't fight the frustration.

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:27.763
Let it be the catalyst

00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:29.890
for whimsy.

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:34.254
(Laughter)

00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:35.437
Thank you.

00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.293
(Applause)
