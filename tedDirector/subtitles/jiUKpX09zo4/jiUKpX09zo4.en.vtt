00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Well, this is about state budgets.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
This is probably the most boring topic

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
of the whole morning.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that we need to care about.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
State budgets

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
are big, big money --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I'll show you the numbers --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and they get very little scrutiny.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The understanding is very low.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Many of the people involved

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
have special interests or short-term interests

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that get them not thinking

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
about what the implications of the trends are.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And these budgets

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
are the key for our future;

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
they're the key for our kids.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Most education funding --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
whether it's K through 12,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
or the great universities or community colleges --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
most of the money for those things

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
is coming out of these state budgets.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
But we have a problem.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Here's the overall picture.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
U.S. economy is big --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
14.7 trillion.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Now out of that pie,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
the government spends 36 percent.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So this is combining the federal level,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
which is the largest,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the state level and the local level.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And it's really in this combined way

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that you get an overall sense of what's going on,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
because there's a lot of complex things

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
like Medicaid and research money

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that flow across those boundaries.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But we're spending 36 percent.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Well what are we taking in?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Simple business question.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Answer is 26 percent.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
sort of a mind-blowing number.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that we've had an economic recession.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Receipts go down,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
some spending programs go up,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
but most of it is not because of that.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Most of it is because of ways

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that the liabilities are building up

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and the trends,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and that creates a huge challenge.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
In fact, this is the forecast picture.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
There are various things in here:

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I could say we might raise more revenue,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
It is an increasingly difficult picture,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
even assuming the economy does quite well --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
probably better than it will do.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
This is what you see

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
at this overall level.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Now how did we get here?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
How could you have a problem like this?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
After all, at least on paper,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Only one state says

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
they don't have to balance the budget.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
But what this means actually

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
is that there's a pretense.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
There's no real, true balancing going on,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and in a sense, the games they play to hide that

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
actually obscure the topic so much

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
that people don't see things

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
When Jerry Brown was elected,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
this was the challenge that was put to him.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
That is, through various gimmicks and things,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
a so-called balanced budget

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
had led him to have 25 billion missing

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
out of the 76 billion in proposed spending.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Now he's put together some thoughts:

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
About half of that he'll cut,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
another half,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
perhaps in a very complex set of steps,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
taxes will be approved.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
But even so,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
as you go out into those future years,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
various pension costs, health costs go up enough,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and the revenue does not go up enough.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So you get a big squeeze.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
What were those things that allowed us to hide this?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Well, some really nice little tricks.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And these were somewhat noticed.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The paper said, "It's not really balanced.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
It's got holes.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
It perpetuates deficit spending.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
It's riddled with gimmicks."

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And really when you get down to it,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the guys at Enron never would have done this.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
This is so blatant,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
so extreme.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Is anyone paying attention

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to some of the things these guys do?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
They borrow money.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
They make you pay more in withholding

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
just to help their cash flow out.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
They sell off the assets.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
They defer the payments.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
They sell off the revenues from tobacco.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And California's not unique.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
In fact, there's about five states that are worse

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and only really four states

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that don't face this big challenge.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So it's systemic across the entire country.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It really comes from the fact

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
that certain long-term obligations --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and just generosity --

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that these mis-accounting things

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
allow to develop over time,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that you've got a problem.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
This is the retiree health care benefits.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
much worse than the car companies.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And everybody looked at that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
The forecast for the medical piece alone

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
is to go from 26 percent of the budget

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to 42 percent.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Well what's going to give?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Well in order to accommodate that,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.260
you would have to cut education spending in half.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It really is this young versus the old

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
to some degree.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
If you don't change that revenue picture,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
if you don't solve what you're doing in health care,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
you're going to be deinvesting in the young.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The great University of California university system,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
the great things that have gone on,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
won't happen.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So far it's meant layoffs,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
increased class sizes.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Within the education community there's this discussion of,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
or the less good teachers who get laid off?"

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
where do you do that? How much effect does that have?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
well maybe you think that's okay.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
There's ways, if it's temporary,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
to minimize the impact,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
but it's a problem.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It's also really a problem for where we need to go.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Technology has a role to play.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Well we need money to experiment with that,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
to get those tools in there.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
measuring them, giving them feedback,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
taking videos in the classroom.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
That's something I think is very, very important.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Well you have to allocate dollars

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
for that system

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and for that incentive pay.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
In a situation where you have growth,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
you put the new money into this.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
But with the type of cuts we're talking about,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
it will be far, far harder

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to get these incentives for excellence,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
or to move over

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to use technology in the new way.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So what's going on?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Where's the brain trust

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that's in error here?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Well there really is no brain trust.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.260
It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Just look at this spending.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
California will spend over 100 billion,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Microsoft, 38,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Google, about 19.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
both inside Google and Microsoft

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
should they have spent on that?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
it really is quite phenomenal.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Everybody has an opinion.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
There's great feedback.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And the numbers are used to make decisions.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
particularly these long-term trends --

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
you don't have that type of involvement

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
on a number that's more important

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
in terms of equity, in terms of learning.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So what do we need to do?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
We need better tools.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
We can get some things out on the Internet.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I'm going to use my website

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
to put up some things that will give the basic picture.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
We need lots more.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
There's a few good books,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
one about school spending and where the money comes from --

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
how that's changed over time, and the challenge.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
We need better accounting.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
We need to take the fact

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
that the current employees, the future liabilities they create,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that should come out of the current budget.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
the way they have.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
It should be more like private accounting.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
It's the gold standard.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And finally, we need to really reward politicians.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We just shot you."

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
In fact, there are some like these:

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
who have gone through and given proposals

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
In fact, the week afterwards,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
some tax cuts were done

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
that made the situation even worse

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
than their assumptions.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So we need these pieces.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Now I think this is a solvable problem.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It's a great country with lots of people.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.260
But we have to draw those people in,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
because this is about education.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And just look at what happened with the tuitions

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
with the University of California

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and project that out for another three, four, five years --

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
it's unaffordable.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And that's the kind of thing --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
the investment in the young --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
that makes us great, allows us to contribute.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
It allows us to do the art,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
the biotechnology, the software

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and all those magic things.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And so the bottom line is

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
we need to care about state budgets

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
because they're critical for our kids and our future.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Thank you.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
(Applause)
