00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I started my journey 30 years ago.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
And I worked in mines. And I realized that

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
this was a world unseen.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I wanted, through color and large format cameras

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and very large prints,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
to make a body of work that somehow

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
became symbols of our

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
use of the landscape,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
how we use the land.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And to me this was

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that I thought photography was perfectly suited

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to doing this type of work.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
it occurred to me that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
oil is underpinning the scale and speed.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Because that is what has changed,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And so then I went out to develop a whole series

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
on the landscape of oil.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
refinement. And that's one chapter.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
how we use it -- our cities,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
our cars, our motorcultures,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
where people gather around the vehicle

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
as a celebration.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
this entropic end,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
where all of our parts of cars, our tires,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
oil filters,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
helicopters, planes --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And to me, again, photography was

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
a way in which I could explore and research the world,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and find those places.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And another idea that I had as well,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that was brought forward by an ecologist --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
he basically did a calculation where

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
he took one liter of gas and said,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It was 23 metric tons for one liter.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So whenever I fill up my gas,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I think of that liter, and how much carbon.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
but he did the calculations for our Earth

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
From the photosynthetic growth,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
it would take 500 years of that growth

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And that also brought me to the fact that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
this poses such a risk to our society.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Looking at 30 billion per year,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
we look at our two largest suppliers,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And together they only form about 15 years of supply.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
only gives us about 45 years.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
peak oil will come upon us.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So, to me, using photography --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
take the task of using our talents,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
our ways of thinking,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to begin to deal with what I think is probably

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
one of the most challenging issues of our time,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
how to deal with our energy crisis.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And I would like to say that, on the other side of it,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I can look at them and say, "We did everything

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
we possibly, humanly could do,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
to begin to mitigate this,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
what I feel is one of the most important and critical

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
moments in our time. Thank you.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
(Applause)
