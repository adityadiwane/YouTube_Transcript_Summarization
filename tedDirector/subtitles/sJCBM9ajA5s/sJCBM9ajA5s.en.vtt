00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:15.388
We all go to doctors.

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:21.282
And we do so with trust and blind faith

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:25.164
that the test they are ordering
and the medications they're prescribing

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:28.363
are based upon evidence --

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:31.314
evidence that's designed to help us.

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:38.181
However, the reality is that that hasn't
always been the case for everyone.

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:40.381
What if I told you

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:44.351
that the medical science discovered
over the past century

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.042
has been based on only
half the population?

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.360
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.400
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.389
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.652
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:07.341
but no matter who walks
through the door to the ER,

00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:09.817
we order the same tests,

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:11.975
we prescribe the same medication,

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.401
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.624
Why would we?

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:22.794
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:27.377
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.552
withdrawn from the market

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:31.969
are due to side effects on women.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.391
So let's think about that for a minute.

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:39.289
Why are we discovering
side effects on women

00:01:39.313 --> 00:01:42.599
only after a drug has been
released to the market?

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:49.156
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.337
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.329
to animal studies,

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:56.480
to then clinical trials on humans,

00:01:56.504 --> 00:02:00.375
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.735
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.540
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:11.946
it takes to go through that process.

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:16.549
So why are we discovering
unacceptable side effects

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:21.024
on half the population
after that has gone through?

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.427
What's happening?

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:28.881
Well, it turns out that those cells
used in that laboratory,

00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:30.835
they're male cells,

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.261
and the animals used
in the animal studies were male animals,

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:39.375
and the clinical trials have been
performed almost exclusively on men.

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:46.530
How is it that the male model became
our framework for medical research?

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:50.625
Let's look at an example that has been
popularized in the media,

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.855
and it has to do
with the sleep aid Ambien.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.643
Ambien was released on the market
over 20 years ago,

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:03.480
and since then, hundreds of millions
of prescriptions have been written,

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:07.952
primarily to women, because women
suffer more sleep disorders than men.

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:11.223
But just this past year,

00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:14.671
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.582
for women only,

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.443
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.380
at a slower rate than men,

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:25.443
causing them to wake up in the morning

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.661
with more of the active drug
in their system.

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:32.615
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.606
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.

00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:40.899
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:45.716
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.546
were involved in a motor vehicle accident

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.022
that possibly could have been prevented

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:57.161
if this type of analysis was performed
and acted upon 20 years ago

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:59.193
when this drug was first released.

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.284
How many other things need
to be analyzed by gender?

00:04:05.197 --> 00:04:06.879
What else are we missing?

00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:13.231
World War II changed a lot of things,

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.136
and one of them was this need
to protect people

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.500
from becoming victims of medical research
without informed consent.

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:25.143
So some much-needed guidelines
or rules were set into place,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:30.189
and part of that was this desire
to protect women of childbearing age

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:33.164
from entering into any
medical research studies.

00:04:34.016 --> 00:04:38.579
There was fear: what if something
happened to the fetus during the study?

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.915
Who would be responsible?

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.488
And so the scientists
at this time actually thought

00:04:44.512 --> 00:04:47.128
this was a blessing in disguise,

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:52.365
because let's face it -- men's bodies
are pretty homogeneous.

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:56.313
They don't have the constantly
fluctuating levels of hormones

00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:00.081
that could disrupt clean data
they could get if they had only men.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.920
It was easier. It was cheaper.

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:08.484
Not to mention, at this time,
there was a general assumption

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:12.733
that men and women
were alike in every way,

00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:16.200
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.

00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:20.028
So it was decided:

00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:24.633
medical research was performed on men,

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.414
and the results were later
applied to women.

00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:32.744
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?

00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:37.024
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:41.593
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.

00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:45.387
It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."

00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:49.105
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.614
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:56.779
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that

00:05:56.803 --> 00:06:01.106
by excluding women
from all medical research studies

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.619
we actually did them a disservice,

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:06.975
in that apart from reproductive issues,

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.563
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs

00:06:09.587 --> 00:06:11.305
of the female patient.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:18.513
Since that time, an overwhelming amount
of evidence has come to light

00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:24.048
that shows us just how different
men and women are in every way.

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:32.050
You know, we have this saying in medicine:

00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:35.022
children are not just little adults.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.747
And we say that to remind ourselves

00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:43.448
that children actually have
a different physiology than normal adults.

00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:49.635
And it's because of this that the medical
specialty of pediatrics came to light.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:55.905
And we now conduct research on children
in order to improve their lives.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.936
And I know the same thing
can be said about women.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.021
Women are not just men
with boobs and tubes.

00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:10.117
But they have their own
anatomy and physiology

00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:13.671
that deserves to be studied
with the same intensity.

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.312
Let's take the cardiovascular
system, for example.

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.706
This area in medicine has done the most
to try to figure out

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.879
why it seems men and women have
completely different heart attacks.

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:33.089
Heart disease is the number one killer
for both men and women,

00:07:33.113 --> 00:07:37.549
but more women die within the first year
of having a heart attack than men.

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:43.063
Men will complain
of crushing chest pain --

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.569
an elephant is sitting on their chest.

00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:47.995
And we call this typical.

00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:52.712
Women have chest pain, too.

00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:59.433
But more women than men
will complain of "just not feeling right,"

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:03.767
"can't seem to get enough air in,"

00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:05.765
"just so tired lately."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.903
And for some reason we call this atypical,

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:13.854
even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:21.308
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:24.530
If we look at the anatomy,

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:30.569
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:35.073
and the way that those blood vessels
develop disease is different

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.152
in women compared to men.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:43.027
And the test that we use to determine
if someone is at risk for a heart attack,

00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:47.623
well, they were initially designed
and tested and perfected in men,

00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:50.781
and so aren't as good
at determining that in women.

00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:55.242
And then if we think
about the medications --

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:58.513
common medications
that we use, like aspirin.

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:04.294
We give aspirin to healthy men to help
prevent them from having a heart attack,

00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:08.552
but do you know that if you
give aspirin to a healthy woman,

00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:10.162
it's actually harmful?

00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:14.758
What this is doing is merely telling us

00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:17.534
that we are scratching the surface.

00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:22.571
Emergency medicine
is a fast-paced business.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.916
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.916
like cancer and stroke,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.073
are there important differences between
men and women that we could be utilizing?

00:09:36.252 --> 00:09:41.056
Or even, why is it that some people
get those runny noses

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.265
more than others,

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:46.616
or why the pain medication that we give
to those stubbed toes

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.845
work in some and not in others?

00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:58.518
The Institute of Medicine has said
every cell has a sex.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.233
What does this mean?

00:10:02.532 --> 00:10:04.930
Sex is DNA.

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:09.295
Gender is how someone
presents themselves in society.

00:10:09.883 --> 00:10:12.423
And these two may not always match up,

00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:15.613
as we can see with our
transgendered population.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.655
But it's important to realize
that from the moment of conception,

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.801
every cell in our bodies --

00:10:23.825 --> 00:10:27.126
skin, hair, heart and lungs --

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.437
contains our own unique DNA,

00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:34.212
and that DNA contains
the chromosomes that determine

00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:39.297
whether we become
male or female, man or woman.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.988
It used to be thought

00:10:42.012 --> 00:10:46.340
that those sex-determining
chromosomes pictured here --

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:49.737
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --

00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:54.975
merely determined whether you
would be born with ovaries or testes,

00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:58.740
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:03.329
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:09.591
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --

00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:12.060
or it's at least a little incomplete.

00:11:12.084 --> 00:11:16.862
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
from the Whitehead Institute,

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:18.860
who works on the Y chromosome,

00:11:18.884 --> 00:11:21.051
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,

00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:26.734
they have found evidence that tells us
that those sex-determining chromosomes

00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:29.355
that are in every cell in our bodies

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:34.738
continue to remain active
for our entire lives

00:11:36.517 --> 00:11:40.092
and could be what's responsible
for the differences we see

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.331
in the dosing of drugs,

00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:45.321
or why there are differences
between men and women

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:48.861
in the susceptibility
and severity of diseases.

00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:53.952
This new knowledge is the game-changer,

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.799
and it's up to those scientists
that continue to find that evidence,

00:12:00.823 --> 00:12:04.976
but it's up to the clinicians
to start translating this data

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.999
at the bedside, today.

00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:10.324
Right now.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.474
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization

00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:19.481
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:24.125
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:25.554
and for patient care.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.748
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.

00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:33.224
That's a big job.

00:12:34.162 --> 00:12:39.301
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.882
But I believe in them.

00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:49.479
I know they're going to see the value
of incorporating the gender lens

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:51.225
into the current curriculum.

00:12:52.598 --> 00:12:57.216
It's about training the future
health care providers correctly.

00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:01.588
And regionally,

00:13:01.612 --> 00:13:05.473
I'm a co-creator of a division within
the Department of Emergency Medicine

00:13:05.497 --> 00:13:07.217
here at Brown University,

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:09.851
called Sex and Gender
in Emergency Medicine,

00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:14.501
and we conduct the research to determine
the differences between men and women

00:13:14.525 --> 00:13:16.683
in emergent conditions,

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:21.975
like heart disease and stroke
and sepsis and substance abuse,

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:26.376
but we also believe
that education is paramount.

00:13:27.304 --> 00:13:31.305
We've created a 360-degree
model of education.

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:37.287
We have programs for the doctors,
for the nurses, for the students

00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:39.017
and for the patients.

00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:43.569
Because this cannot just be left up
to the health care leaders.

00:13:44.315 --> 00:13:47.792
We all have a role in making a difference.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.507
But I must warn you: this is not easy.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.432
In fact, it's hard.

00:13:57.146 --> 00:14:01.538
It's essentially changing the way
we think about medicine

00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:04.559
and health and research.

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.847
It's changing our relationship
to the health care system.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.648
But there's no going back.

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:17.038
We now know just enough

00:14:17.062 --> 00:14:19.418
to know that we weren't doing it right.

00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:23.990
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,

00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:28.663
"Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,

00:14:28.687 --> 00:14:30.861
but comes through continuous struggle."

00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:35.044
And the first step
towards change is awareness.

00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:40.194
This is not just about improving
medical care for women.

00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:45.661
This is about personalized,
individualized health care for everyone.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:53.192
This awareness has the power to transform
medical care for men and women.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:15:00.515
And from now on, I want you
to ask your doctors

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:04.816
whether the treatments you are receiving
are specific to your sex and gender.

00:15:06.246 --> 00:15:08.935
They may not know the answer --

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.125
yet.

00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:14.963
But the conversation has begun,
and together we can all learn.

00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:20.174
Remember, for me
and my colleagues in this field,

00:15:20.198 --> 00:15:22.475
your sex and gender matter.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:24.531
Thank you.

00:15:24.555 --> 00:15:28.999
(Applause)
