00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.976
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.296
I was the son of an aerospace engineer.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.056
I lived and breathed the Apollo program.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.136
We either saw the launches
from our backyard

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.816
or we saw it by driving
in the hour over to the Cape.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.698
I was impressed by, obviously,
space and everything about it,

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.627
but I was most impressed
by the engineering that went into it.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.416
Behind me you see an amazing view,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.336
a picture that was taken
from the International Space Station,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.536
and it shows a portion of our planet

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.976
that's rarely seen and rarely studied

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.296
and almost never explored.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.856
That place is called the stratosphere.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.016
If you start on the planet
and you go up and up and up,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.616
it gets colder and colder and colder,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.016
until you reach the beginning
of the stratosphere,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.656
and then an amazing thing happens.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.696
It gets colder at a much slower rate,
and then it starts warming up,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.376
and then it gets warmer and warmer

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.336
until the point where you can
almost survive without any protection,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.176
about zero degrees,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.495
and then you end up
getting colder and colder,

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.736
and that's the top of the stratosphere.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.696
It is one of the least accessible
places on our planet.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.456
Most often, when it's visited,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.376
it's by astronauts
who are blazing up at it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.256
at probably several times
the speed of sound,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.256
and they get a few seconds on the way up,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.056
and then they get this blazing
ball of fire coming back in,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.016
on the way back in.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.336
But the question I asked is, is it
possible to linger in the stratosphere?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.696
Is it possible to experience
the stratosphere?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.240
Is it possible to explore
the stratosphere?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.416
I studied this using
my favorite search engine

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.456
for quite a while, about a year,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.976
and then I made a scary phone call.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.696
It was a reference from a friend of mine
to call Taber MacCallum

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.456
from Paragon Space
Development Corporation,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.861
and I asked him the question:

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.245
is it possible to build

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.136
a system to go into the stratosphere?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.736
And he said it was.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.456
And after a period of about three years,
we proceeded to do just that.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960
And on October 24 of last year,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.880
in this suit,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840
I started on the ground,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.760
I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.576
but who's counting?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.056
(Laughter)

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.480
Came back to Earth
at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.840
It was a four-minute
and 27-second descent.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.680
And when I got to 10,000 feet,
I opened a parachute and I landed.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.680
(Applause)

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.056
But this is really a science talk,
and it's really an engineering talk,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.376
and what was amazing to me
about that experience

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.056
is that Taber said, yes, I think
we can build a stratospheric suit,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.696
and more than that, come down tomorrow

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.856
and let's talk to the team
that formed the core of the group

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.080
that actually built it.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.736
And they did something
which I think is important,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.096
which is they took
the analogy of scuba diving.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.816
So in scuba diving,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.656
you have a self-contained system.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.016
You have everything
that you could ever need.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.080
You have a scuba tank.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.136
You have a wetsuit.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.896
You have visibility.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.656
And that scuba is exactly this system,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.120
and we're going to launch it
into the stratosphere.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.080
Three years later, this is what we have.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.856
We've got an amazing suit
that was made by ILC Dover.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.336
ILC Dover was the company
that made all of the Apollo suits

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.776
and all of the extravehicular
activity suits.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.056
They had never sold a suit commercially,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.656
only to the government,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.296
but they sold one to me,
which I am very grateful for.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.480
Up here we have a parachute.
This was all about safety.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.056
Everyone on the team knew

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.816
that I have a wife
and two small children --

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.416
10 and 15 --

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.495
and I wanted to come back safely.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.949
So there's a main parachute
and a reserve parachute,

00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:33.173
and if I do nothing,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.427
the reserve parachute is going to open
because of an automatic opening device.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.296
The suit itself
can protect me from the cold.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.256
This area in the front here
has thermal protection.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.456
It will actually heat water
that will wrap around my body.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.936
It has two redundant oxygen tanks.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.016
Even if I was to get
a quarter-inch hole in this suit,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.616
which is extremely unlikely,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.440
this system would still protect me
from the low pressure of space.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.976
The main advantage of this system
is weight and complexity.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.976
So the system weighs about 500 pounds,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.816
and if you compare it to the other attempt
recently to go up in the stratosphere,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.096
they used a capsule.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.096
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing
amount of complexity that goes into it,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.056
and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.776
and to raise 3,000 pounds
to an altitude of 135,000 feet,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.936
which was my target altitude,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.120
it would have taken a balloon
that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.176
Because I only weighed
500 pounds in this system,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.416
we could do it with a balloon
that was five times smaller than that,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.856
and that allowed us to use a launch system
that was dramatically simpler

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.520
than what needs to be done
for a much larger balloon.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.136
So with that, I want to take you
to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.856
We had an amazing team
that got up in the middle of the night.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.456
And here's the suit.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.616
Again, this is using the front loader
that you'll see in a second,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.856
and I want to play you a video
of the actual launch.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.896
Roswell's a great place
to launch balloons,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.096
but it's a fantastic place
to land under a parachute,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.520
especially when you're going to land
70 miles away from the place you started.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.680
That's a helium truck in the background.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.616
It's darkness.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.856
I've already spent about an hour
and a half pre-breathing.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.280
And then here you see the suit going on.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.240
It takes about an hour to get the suit on.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.216
Astronauts get this really nice
air-conditioned van

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.816
to go to the launch pad,
but I got a front loader.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.016
(Laughter)

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.576
You can see the top.
You can see the balloon up there.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.120
That's where the helium is.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.280
This is Dave clearing the airspace
with the FAA for 15 miles.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.560
And there we go.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.216
(Laughter)

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.936
That's me waving with my left hand.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.016
The reason I'm waving with my left hand

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.696
is because on the right hand
is the emergency cutaway.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.296
(Laughter)

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.160
My team forbade me
from using my right hand.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.616
So the trip up is beautiful.
It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.456
(Laughter)

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.576
It took two hours
and seven minutes to go up,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.336
and it was the most peaceful
two hours and seven minutes.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.240
I was mostly trying to relax.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.936
My heart rate was very low

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.080
and I was trying not to use
very much oxygen.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.576
You can see how the fields
in the background

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.216
are relatively big at this point,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.296
and you can see me going up and up.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.336
It's interesting here,
because if you look,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.736
I'm right over the airport,
and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.456
but immediately I'm about to go
into a stratospheric wind

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.200
of over 120 miles an hour.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.176
This is my flight director telling me
that I had just gone higher

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.416
than anybody else
had ever gone in a balloon,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.120
and I was about 4,000 feet from release.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.040
This is what it looks like.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.145
You can see the darkness of space,
the curvature of the Earth,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.400
the fragile planet below.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.400
I'm practicing my emergency procedures
mentally right now.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.656
If anything goes wrong,
I want to be ready.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.856
And the main thing that I want to do here

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.296
is to have a release and fall
and stay completely stable.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.240
(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.960
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.269
Alan Eustace: There's the balloon
going by, fully inflated at this point.

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:08.536
And there you can see a drogue parachute,
which I'll demonstrate in just a second,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.136
because that's really important.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
There's the balloon
going by a second time.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.360
Right now, I'm about
at the speed of sound.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.360
There's nothing for me to tell
it's the speed of sound,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.656
and very soon I will actually be
as fast as I ever get,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.320
822 miles an hour.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.153
(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.576
AE: So now I'm down low right now

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.896
and you can basically see
the parachute come out right there.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.682
At this point, I'm very happy
that there's a parachute out.

00:10:05.789 --> 00:10:07.456
I thought I was the only one happy,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.816
but it turns out mission control
was really happy as well.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.936
The really nice thing about this
is the moment I opened --

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.336
I had a close of friend of mine,
Blikkies, my parachute guy.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.296
He flew in another airplane,
and he actually jumped out

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.296
and landed right next to me.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.576
He was my wingman on the descent.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.816
This is my landing, but it's probably more
properly called a crash.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.056
(Laughter)

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.536
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't
even close to my worst landing.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.416
(Laughter)

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.760
(Applause)

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.656
(Video) Man: How are you doing?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.960
AE: Hi there!

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.496
Yay.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.816
(Laughter)

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.336
So I want to tell you one thing

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.656
that you might not have seen
in that video,

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.536
but one of the most critical parts
of the entire thing was the release

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.416
and what happens right after you release.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.736
And what we tried to do was use
something called a drogue parachute,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.456
and a drogue parachute
was there to stabilize me.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.536
And I'll show you one of those right now.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.200
If any of you have ever
gone tandem skydiving,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.640
you probably used one of these.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.136
But the problem with one of these things

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.096
is right when you release,
you're in zero gravity.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.736
So it's very easy for this
to just turn right around you.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.040
And before you know it,
you can be tangled up or spinning,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.976
or you can release this drogue late,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.056
in which case what happens
is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.576
and this thing is going to destroy itself

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.800
and not be very useful.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.696
But the guys at United Parachute
Technologies came up with this idea,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.656
and it was a roll that looks like that,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.360
but watch what happens when I pull it out.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.160
It's forming a pipe.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.880
This pipe is so solid

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.136
that you can take this drogue parachute
and wrap it around,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.480
and there's no way
it will ever tangle with you.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.920
And that prevented
a very serious potential problem.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.496
So nothing is possible
without an amazing team of people.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.976
The core of this was about 20 people

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.096
that worked on this for the three years,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.736
and they were incredible.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.536
People asked me what the best part
of this whole thing was,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.016
and it was a chance
to work with the best experts

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.656
in meteorology and ballooning
and parachute technology

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.136
and environmental systems
and high altitude medicine.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.296
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream
to work with that group of people.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.576
And I also at the same time
wanted to thank my friends at Google,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.456
both for supporting me during this effort

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.776
and also covering for me
in the times that I was away.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.096
But there's one other group
I wanted to thank, and that's my family.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.336
Yay.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.576
(Applause)

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.296
I would constantly give them speeches
about the safety of technology,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.520
and they weren't hearing any of it.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.456
It was super hard on them,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.056
and the only reason
that my wife put up with it

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.576
was because I came back incredibly happy
after each of the 250 tests,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.776
and she didn't want
to take that away from me.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.576
So I want to close with a story.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.176
My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,
she and I were in the car,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.656
and we were driving down the road,
and she was sitting there,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.056
and she had this idea, and she goes,
"Dad, I've got this idea."

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.600
And so I listened to her idea
and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.936
And she looks at me

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.296
and she goes, "Dad,
after what you just did,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.720
how can you call anything impossible?"

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.016
And I laughed, and I said,
"OK, it's not impossible,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.440
it's just very, very hard."

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.736
And then I paused for a second,
and I said, "Katelyn,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.496
it may not be impossible,
it may not even be very, very hard,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.296
it's just that I don't know how to do it."

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.536
Thank you.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.640
(Applause)
