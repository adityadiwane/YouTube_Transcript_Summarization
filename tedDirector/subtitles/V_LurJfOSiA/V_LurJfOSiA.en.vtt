00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
You should be nice

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
to nerds.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
In fact, I'd go so far as to say,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
if you don't already have a nerd in your life,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
you should get one.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I'm just saying.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Scientists and engineers

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
change the world.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I'd like to tell you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
about a magical place called DARPA

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
where scientists and engineers

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
defy the impossible

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and refuse to fear failure.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Now these two ideas

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
are connected more than you may realize,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
because when you remove the fear of failure,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
impossible things

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.260
suddenly become possible.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
If you want to know how,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
ask yourself this question:

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
What would you attempt to do

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
if you knew you could not fail?

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
If you really ask yourself

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
this question,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
you can't help but feel uncomfortable.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I feel a little uncomfortable.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Because when you ask it,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
you begin to understand

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
how the fear of failure constrains you,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
how it keeps us

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
from attempting great things,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and life gets dull,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
amazing things stop happening.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Sure, good things happen,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
but amazing things

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
stop happening.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Now I should be clear,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm not encouraging failure,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
I'm discouraging

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
fear of failure.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Because it's not failure itself

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that constrains us.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
The path to truly new,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
never-been-done-before things

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
always has failure along the way.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We're tested.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
of achieving something great.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Clemenceau said,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
"Life gets interesting when we fail,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
because it's a sign

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
that we've surpassed ourselves."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
In 1895,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Lord Kelvin declared

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that heavier-than-air flying machines

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
were impossible.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
In October of 1903,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
the prevailing opinion

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
of expert aerodynamicists

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
was that maybe in 10 million years

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
we could build an aircraft that would fly.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And two months later on December 17th,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Orville Wright powered the first airplane

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
across a beach in North Carolina.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
The flight lasted 12 seconds

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and covered 120 feet.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That was 1903.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
One year later,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
the next declarations of impossibilities began.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
in the French army,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
said, "Airplanes are interesting toys,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
but of no military value."

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
40 years later,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
aero experts coined the term transonic.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.260
They debated, should it have one S or two?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and it wasn't at all clear

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
In 1947,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
there was no wind tunnel data

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.260
beyond Mach 0.85.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And yet,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.260
on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
of his Bell X-1

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and he flew

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
towards an unknown possibility,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and in so doing,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
he became the first pilot

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to fly faster than the speed of sound.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Six of eight Atlas rockets

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
blew up on the pad.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
After 11 complete mission failures,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
we got our first images from space.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And on that first flight

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
we got more data

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.260
than in all U-2 missions combined.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It took a lot of failures

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
to get there.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Since we took to the sky,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
we have wanted to fly

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
faster and farther.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And to do so,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
we've had to believe in impossible things.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And we've had to refuse

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
to fear failure.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
That's still true today.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Today, we don't talk about flying transonically,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
or even supersonically,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
we talk about flying hypersonically --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
At Mach 20,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
we can fly from New York to Long Beach

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
At that speed,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
the surface of the airfoil

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
is the temperature of molten steel --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
like a blast furnace.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
We are essentially burning the airfoil

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
as we fly it.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And we are flying it,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
or trying to.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is the fastest maneuvering aircraft

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
ever built.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
It's boosted to near-space

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
atop a Minotaur IV rocket.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
so we have to bleed it off

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
by flying the rocket

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
at an 89 degree angle of attack

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
for portions of the trajectory.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
That's an unnatural act

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
for a rocket.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
The third stage has a camera.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
We call it rocketcam.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And it's pointed

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
at the hypersonic glider.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
This is the actual rocketcam footage

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
from flight one.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
But this is what it looks like

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
from the third stage of the rocket

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
looking at the unmanned glider

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
as it heads into the atmosphere

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
back towards Earth.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
We've flown twice.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
In the first flight,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
But we collected more hypersonic flight data

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
than in 30 years

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
of ground-based testing combined.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And in the second flight,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
three minutes of fully-controlled,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
aerodynamic flight

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
at Mach 20.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
We must fly again,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
because amazing, never-been-done-before things

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
require that you fly.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
You can't learn to fly at Mach 20

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
unless you fly.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And while there's no substitute for speed,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
maneuverability is a very close second.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
to get from New York to Long Beach,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
a hummingbird would take,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
well, days.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
but they are maneuverable.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
that can fly backwards.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
It can fly up, down,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
forwards, backwards,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
even upside-down.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And so if we wanted to fly in this room

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
or places where humans can't go,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
we'd need an aircraft

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
small enough and maneuverable enough

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
to do so.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
This is a hummingbird drone.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
It can fly in all directions,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
even backwards.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
It can hover and rotate.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
This prototype aircraft

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
is equipped with a video camera.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
It weighs less than one AA battery.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It does not eat nectar.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
In 2008,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
it flew for a whopping 20 seconds,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
a year later, two minutes,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
then six,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
eventually 11.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Many prototypes crashed -- many.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
But there's no way

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
to learn to fly like a hummingbird

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
unless you fly.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:04.260
(Applause)

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
It's beautiful, isn't it.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Wow.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
It's great.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:25.260
(Applause)

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Failure is part of creating

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
new and amazing things.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We cannot both fear failure

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and make amazing new things --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
like a robot

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
with the stability of a dog on rough terrain,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
or maybe even ice;

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
a robot that can run like a cheetah,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
or climb stairs like a human

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.260
with the occasional clumsiness of a human.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Or perhaps, Spider Man

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
will one day be Gecko Man.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
A gecko can support

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
its entire body weight

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
with one toe.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
has 14,000 hair-like structures

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
called setae.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
They are used to help it grip to surfaces

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
using intermolecular forces.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Today we can manufacture structures

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
The result,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
a four-by-four-inch

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
artificial nano-gecko adhesive.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
can support a static load

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
of 660 pounds.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
That's enough to stick

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
no nails.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
So much for Velcro, right?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And it's not just passive structures,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
it's entire machines.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
This is a spider mite.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
It's one millimeter long,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
but it looks like Godzilla

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
next to these micromachines.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
In the world of Godzilla spider mites,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
we can make millions of mirrors,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
each one-fifth the diameter

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
of a human hair,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
to make large screen displays,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
so that we can watch movies like "Godzilla"

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
in high-def.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And if we can build machines

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
at that scale,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
at the microscale?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Today we are making metals

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
that are lighter than Styrofoam,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
so light

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
they can sit atop a dandelion puff

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and be blown away

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
with a wisp of air --

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
so light

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
that you can make a car that two people can lift,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
but so strong

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
From the smallest wisp of air

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
to the powerful forces of nature's storms.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
There are 44 lightning strikes per second

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
around the globe.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Each lightning bolt heats the air

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
hotter than the surface of the Sun.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
What if we could use

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
these electromagnetic pulses

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
as beacons,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
beacons in a moving network

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
of powerful transmitters?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Experiments suggest

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260
that lightning could be the next GPS.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Using a grid the size of your thumb,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
with 32 electrodes

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
on the surface of his brain,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Tim uses his thoughts

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:52.260
to control an advanced prosthetic arm.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And his thoughts

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
made him reach for Katie.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.260
This is the first time

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
a human has controlled a robot

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
with thought alone.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And it is the first time

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
that Tim has held Katie's hand

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
in seven years.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
That moment mattered

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
to Tim and Katie,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and this green goo

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
may someday matter to you.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
This green goo

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
It was made in tobacco plants.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Tobacco plants

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
can make millions of doses of vaccine

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
in weeks instead of months,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
and it might just be

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
the first healthy use of tobacco ever.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And if it seems far-fetched

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that tobacco plants could make people healthy,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
what about gamers that could solve problems

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
that experts can't solve?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Last September,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
the gamers of Foldit

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
solved the three-dimensional structure

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
of the retroviral protease

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Now understanding this structure

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.260
is very important for developing treatments.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
For 15 years,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
it was unsolved

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
in the scientific community.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
The gamers of Foldit

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
solved it in 15 days.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Now they were able to do so

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
by working together.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
They were able to work together

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
because they're connected by the Internet.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And others, also connected to the Internet,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.260
used it as an instrument of democracy.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And together

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
they changed the fate of their nation.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
The Internet is home to two billion people,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
or 30 percent of the world's population.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
It allows us to contribute

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and to be heard

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
as individuals.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
It allows us to amplify

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
our voices and our power

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
as a group.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
But it too had humble beginnings.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
In 1969, the internet was but a dream,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
a few sketches on a piece of paper.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
And then on October 29th,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
the first packet-switched message was sent

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
from UCLA to SRI.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
The first two letters of the word "Login,"

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
that's all that made it through --

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
an L and an O --

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Laughter)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Two letters,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
an L and an O,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.260
now a worldwide force.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
So who are these scientists and engineers

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
at a magical place called DARPA?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
They are nerds,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and they are heroes among us.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
They challenge existing perspectives

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
at the edges of science

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and under the most demanding of conditions.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
They remind us

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
that we can change the world

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
if we defy the impossible

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and we refuse to fear failure.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
They remind us

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
that we all have nerd power.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Sometimes we just forget.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
You see, there was a time

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
when you weren't afraid of failure,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
when you were a great artist or a great dancer

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
and you could sing, you were good at math,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
you could build things, you were an astronaut,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
you could jump higher, run faster,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
kick harder than anyone.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
You believed in impossible things

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
and you were fearless.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.260
You were totally and completely in touch

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
with your inner superhero.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Scientists and engineers

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
can indeed change the world.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
So can you.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
You were born to.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So go ahead,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
ask yourself,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
what would you attempt to do

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
if you knew you could not fail?

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Now I want to say,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
this is not easy.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
It's hard to hold onto this feeling,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
really hard.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
I guess in some way,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Doubt and fear always creep in.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
We think someone else, someone smarter than us,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
someone more capable,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
someone with more resources will solve that problem.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
But there isn't anyone else;

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
there's just you.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
And if we're lucky,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
in that moment,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
someone steps into that doubt and fear,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
takes a hand and says,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
"Let me help you believe."

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Jason Harley did that for me.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
Jason started at DARPA

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
on March 18th, 2010.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.260
He was with our transportation team.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
I saw Jason nearly every day,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
sometimes twice a day.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
And more so than most,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
he saw the highs and the lows,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.260
the celebrations and the disappointments.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.260
And on one particularly dark day for me,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
Jason sat down

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
and he wrote an email.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
He was encouraging,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
but firm.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
And when he hit send,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
It mattered to me.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
In that moment

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
and still today

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
when I doubt,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
when I feel afraid,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
when I need to reconnect

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
with that feeling,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
I remember his words,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
they were so powerful.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.260
and back to the skies for you."

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
And remember,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
be nice to nerds.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:52.260
(Applause)

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
(Applause)

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
Chris Anderson: Regina, thank you.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
I have a couple of questions.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
So that glider of yours,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.260
the Mach 20 glider,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.260
the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.260
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?)

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.260
Yeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?)

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
We didn't fly it into the Pacific.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.260
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
that are demanding

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
in terms of really flying at that speed.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.260
And so in the second flight,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
we were able to get three minutes

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.260
of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.260
CA: I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.260
from New York to Long Beach anytime soon.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.260
RD: It might be a little warm.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.260
CA: What do you picture that glider being used for?

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
RD: Well our responsibility

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
is to develop the technology for this.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.260
How it's ultimately used

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.260
will be determined by the military.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.260
Now the purpose of the vehicle though,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.260
the purpose of the technology,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
is to be able to reach anywhere in the world

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.260
in less than 60 minutes.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
CA: And to carry a payload

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
of more than a few pounds? (RD: Yeah.)

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.260
Like what's the payload it could carry?

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.260
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.260
We've got to fly it first.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.260
CA: But not necessarily just a camera?

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.260
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.260
CA: It's amazing.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.260
The hummingbird?

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.260
RD: Yeah?

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.260
CA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.260
with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.260
and failing horribly,

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.260
and there haven't been that many planes built since

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.260
that flap wings.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.260
Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.260
and copy a hummingbird?

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.260
Isn't that a very expensive solution

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.260
for a small maneuverable flying object?

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260
RD: So I mean, in part,

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.260
we wondered if it was possible to do it.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.260
And you have to revisit these questions

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.260
over time.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.260
The folks at AeroVironment

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.260
tried 300 or more different wing designs,

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.260
12 different forms of the avionics.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260
It took them 10 full prototypes

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.260
to get something that would actually fly.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.260
But there's something really interesting

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.260
about a flying machine

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.260
that looks like something you'd recognize.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.260
So we often talk about stealth

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.260
as a means for avoiding any type of sensing,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.260
but when things looks just natural,

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.260
you also don't see them.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.260
CA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.260
It's partly the look. (RD: Sure.)

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.260
It's actually, "Look at that cute hummingbird

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.260
flying into my headquarters."

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.260
(Laughter)

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.260
Because I think, as well as the awe of looking at that,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.260
I'm sure some people here are thinking,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.260
technology catches up so quick,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260
how long is it

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
before some crazed geek with a little remote control

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.260
flies one through a window of the White House?

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.260
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.260
RD: Well look, our singular mission

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.260
is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.260
That's what we do.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.260
It would be inconceivable

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.260
for us to do that work

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.260
if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.260
at the same time.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.260
It's just the nature of what we do.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.260
Now our responsibility

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.260
is to push that edge.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.260
And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.260
of how the technology is developed

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.260
and ultimately used,

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.260
but we can't simply close our eyes

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.260
and pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.260
CA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.260
And you persuade people

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.260
to go to these great feats of invention,

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.260
but at a personal level,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.260
in a way I can't imagine doing your job.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.260
Do you wake up in the night sometimes,

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.260
just asking questions

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.260
about the possibly unintended consequences

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.260
of your team's brilliance?

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.260
RD: Sure.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.260
I think you couldn't be human

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.260
if you didn't ask those questions.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.260
CA: How do you answer them?

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.260
RD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.260
I think that we learn

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.260
as time goes on.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:22.260
My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.260
I work with some of the most amazing people.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.260
And with that exhilaration,

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.260
comes a really deep sense

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.260
of responsibility.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.260
And so you have on the one hand

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.260
this tremendous lift

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.260
of what's possible

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.260
and this tremendous seriousness

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.260
of what it means.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.260
CA: Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.260
Thank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.)

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.260
(Applause)
