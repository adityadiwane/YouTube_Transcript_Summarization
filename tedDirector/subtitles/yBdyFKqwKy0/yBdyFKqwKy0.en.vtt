00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.595
I am in search of another planet
in the universe where life exists.

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.388
I can't see this planet
with my naked eyes

00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:23.698
or even with the most powerful telescopes

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.072
we currently possess.

00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:27.851
But I know that it's there.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.018
And understanding contradictions
that occur in nature

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.398
will help us find it.

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.530
On our planet,

00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:36.527
where there's water, there's life.

00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:39.826
So we look for planets that orbit
at just the right distance

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.149
from their stars.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:43.569
At this distance,

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:47.073
shown in blue on this diagram
for stars of different temperatures,

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.951
planets could be warm enough
for water to flow on their surfaces

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:52.373
as lakes and oceans

00:00:52.397 --> 00:00:53.938
where life might reside.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:58.501
Some astronomers focus their time
and energy on finding planets

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.966
at these distances from their stars.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.393
What I do picks up where their job ends.

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.853
I model the possible
climates of exoplanets.

00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:09.179
And here's why that's important:

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:12.693
there are many factors
besides distance from its star

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.321
that control whether
a planet can support life.

00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:17.813
Take the planet Venus.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:22.337
It's named after the Roman goddess
of love and beauty,

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.971
because of its benign,
ethereal appearance in the sky.

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:29.651
But spacecraft measurements
revealed a different story.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.049
The surface temperature is close
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:35.572
500 Celsius.

00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.539
That's hot enough to melt lead.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:42.953
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
from the sun, is the reason.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:46.080
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:49.744
trapping heat from the sun
and scorching the planet's surface.

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.728
The reality totally contradicted
initial perceptions of this planet.

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:58.349
From these lessons
from our own solar system,

00:01:58.373 --> 00:02:00.389
we've learned that a planet's atmosphere

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:04.015
is crucial to its climate
and potential to host life.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.882
We don't know what the atmospheres
of these planets are like

00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:12.274
because the planets are so small
and dim compared to their stars

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.963
and so far away from us.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.791
For example, one of the closest planets
that could support surface water --

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.172
it's called Gliese 667 Cc --

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:26.132
such a glamorous name, right,
nice phone number for a name --

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.591
it's 23 light years away.

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.861
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.999
Trying to measure
the atmospheric composition

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:39.039
of an exoplanet passing
in front of its host star is hard.

00:02:39.444 --> 00:02:41.324
It's like trying to see a fruit fly

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:43.634
passing in front of a car's headlight.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:47.825
OK, now imagine that car
is 100 trillion miles away,

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.221
and you want to know
the precise color of that fly.

00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:54.375
So I use computer models

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.502
to calculate the kind of atmosphere
a planet would need

00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:00.225
to have a suitable climate
for water and life.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.551
Here's an artist's concept
of the planet Kepler-62f,

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:07.058
with the Earth for reference.

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:09.547
It's 1,200 light years away,

00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.798
and just 40 percent larger than Earth.

00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:16.361
Our NSF-funded work found that it
could be warm enough for open water

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:20.494
from many types of atmospheres
and orientations of its orbit.

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:23.651
So I'd like future telescopes
to follow up on this planet

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:25.246
to look for signs of life.

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:29.865
Ice on a planet's surface
is also important for climate.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.084
Ice absorbs longer,
redder wavelengths of light,

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.238
and reflects shorter, bluer light.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.759
That's why the iceberg
in this photo looks so blue.

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:42.589
The redder light from the sun
is absorbed on its way through the ice.

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:45.470
Only the blue light
makes it all the way to the bottom.

00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:48.339
Then it gets reflected
back to up to our eyes

00:03:48.363 --> 00:03:49.939
and we see blue ice.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.564
My models show that planets
orbiting cooler stars

00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:56.756
could actually be warmer
than planets orbiting hotter stars.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.319
There's another contradiction --

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:02.117
that ice absorbs the longer
wavelength light from cooler stars,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.249
and that light, that energy,
heats the ice.

00:04:06.622 --> 00:04:08.982
Using climate models to explore

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:12.111
how these contradictions
can affect planetary climate

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:15.309
is vital to the search for life elsewhere.

00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:19.305
And it's no surprise
that this is my specialty.

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm an African-American female astronomer

00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:24.636
and a classically trained actor

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.495
who loves to wear makeup
and read fashion magazines,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:33.352
so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate
contradictions in nature --

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.488
(Laughter)

00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:37.976
(Applause)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.093
... and how they can inform our search
for the next planet where life exists.

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:45.153
My organization, Rising Stargirls,

00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:48.605
teaches astronomy
to middle-school girls of color,

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.085
using theater, writing and visual art.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:56.674
That's another contradiction --
science and art don't often go together,

00:04:56.698 --> 00:05:00.500
but interweaving them can help
these girls bring their whole selves

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:01.723
to what they learn,

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:05.187
and maybe one day join
the ranks of astronomers

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:06.965
who are full of contradictions,

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:10.139
and use their backgrounds
to discover, once and for all,

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:13.179
that we are truly not alone
in the universe.

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:15.584
Thank you.

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:24.424
(Applause)
