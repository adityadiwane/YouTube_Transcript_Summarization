00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.875
So when the White House was built

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.868
in the early 19th century, it was an open house.

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:24.004
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams,

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.373
a local dentist happened by.

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.964
He wanted to shake the President's hand.

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.114
The President dismissed the Secretary of State,

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:32.032
whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.842
if he would remove a tooth.

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.900
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.488
he was known to have remarked

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:41.057
— probably the only thing he's known for —

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:43.808
when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:46.073
the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him,

00:00:46.073 --> 00:00:48.688
"Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:52.413
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:54.485
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:57.705
of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.577
the White House was anything but open.

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:03.105
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.284
We were running Windows 2000.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:07.467
Social media were blocked at the firewall.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.007
We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.030
like we have today.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.643
I came in to become the head of Open Government,

00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:17.441
to take the values and the practices of transparency,

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.854
participation and collaboration, and instill them

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:23.680
into the way that we work, to open up government,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.200
to work with people.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.894
Now one of the things that we know

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:30.910
is that companies are very good at getting people to work

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.158
together in teams and in networks to make

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:36.800
very complex products, like cars and computers,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.488
and the more complex the products are a society creates,

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:43.343
the more successful the society is over time.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.088
Companies make goods, but governments,

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:49.208
they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.016
and educating our children and making roads,

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:55.657
but we don't have institutions that are particularly good

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.193
at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions

00:01:58.193 --> 00:02:01.310
that are good at bringing our talents to bear,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.772
at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:08.033
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.609
what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.553
employees how we should open up government.

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:16.785
Turns out that had never been done before.

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:19.404
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:22.682
come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:26.065
on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.385
but in advance. There was no legal precedent,

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.527
no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.368
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.

00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:38.481
Here's the crux of the obstacle.

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.082
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things,

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:44.576
really, values and expertise to and from government

00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:48.425
and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:50.818
But the way that our institutions are designed,

00:02:50.818 --> 00:02:53.869
in our rather 18th-century, centralized model,

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.553
is to channel the flow of values through voting,

00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.753
once every four years, once every two years, at best,

00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:03.314
once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:07.319
era of social media, for us to actually express our values.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.931
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves

00:03:09.931 --> 00:03:12.935
a great deal, perhaps a little too much.

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:15.209
Then in the 19th century, we layer on

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.616
the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.759
to help us govern complex and large societies.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.991
But we've centralized these bureaucracies.

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.436
We've entrenched them. And we know that

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.148
the smartest person always works for someone else.

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:31.828
We need to only look around this room to know that

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:35.425
expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:39.596
and not limited simply to our institutions.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:41.862
Scientists have been studying in recent years

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:44.396
the phenomenon that they often describe as flow,

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:47.660
that the design of our systems, whether natural or social,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.343
channel the flow of whatever runs through them.

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.620
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.090
and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.594
the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.614
the flow of nutrients to the tree,

00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:04.618
sometimes even having to route around an obstacle,

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:07.338
but to get that nutrition flowing.

00:04:07.338 --> 00:04:09.675
The same can be said for our social systems, for our

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:12.163
systems of government, where, at the very least,

00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:15.178
flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:17.834
what the problem is, what's really broken,

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:21.519
and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.799
to redesign the flow of our institutions.

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:29.322
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:33.591
and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions

00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:36.476
that are actually quite recent.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.716
Think about it: What other business do you know,

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:42.116
what other sector of the economy, and especially one

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:45.903
as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:48.807
its business model on a regular basis?

00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:51.898
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest

00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:55.862
in broadband and science education and science grants,

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:59.213
but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning

00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:01.813
the institutions that we have.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:04.149
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.613
partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love

00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:10.529
to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.181
especially around election time, but

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:16.567
the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.440
many of whom will lack basic resources.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.758
So complain as we might, what actually can replace

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:25.069
what we have today?

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.176
What comes the day after the Arab Spring?

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:33.062
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:35.822
to us is that of networks. Right? Networks

00:05:35.822 --> 00:05:38.534
like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:41.038
You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook

00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:43.984
governing 900 million inhabitants.

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:46.727
We might even call them citizens, because they've recently

00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:50.102
risen up to fight against legislative incursion,

00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:52.637
and the citizens of these networks work together

00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:55.878
to serve each other in great ways.

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:58.670
But private communities, private, corporate,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.810
privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.820
They cannot replace government.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.922
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough

00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:09.575
to do the hard work of you and I collaborating

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:13.467
with each other and doing the hard work of governance.

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:16.405
But social media do teach us something.

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:20.879
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.816
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.287
of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:31.621
read and process information in new and exciting ways.

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:33.958
We need to think about how to open up the API

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:38.019
of government, and the way that we're going to do that,

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.267
the next great superpower is going to be the one

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:47.250
who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution --

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.603
because we have to maintain those public values,

00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:52.522
we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:55.187
and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement

00:06:55.187 --> 00:06:58.283
of networks, all of us working together to build

00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:01.984
these new innovations on top of our institutions,

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:04.202
to engage in the practice of governance.

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:07.335
We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:11.187
in the 12th century, invented the jury.

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:15.412
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power

00:07:15.412 --> 00:07:18.113
from government to citizens.

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:21.501
Today we have the opportunity, and we have

00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:25.002
the imperative, to create thousands of new ways

00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:28.241
of interconnecting between networks and institutions,

00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.905
thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:34.582
the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:37.636
to invent the models by which we can cocreate

00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.384
the process of governance.

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:41.999
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:44.621
yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution

00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.603
emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution,

00:07:47.603 --> 00:07:51.412
I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.

00:07:51.412 --> 00:07:52.896
Some of it's very high-tech,

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:54.950
and some of it is extremely low-tech,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.320
such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.864
India, where they take the spending data of the state

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.307
and paint it on 100,000 village walls,

00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:07.602
and then invite the villagers to come and comment

00:08:07.602 --> 00:08:10.090
who is on the government payroll, who's actually died,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.714
what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:15.058
and to work together through civic engagement to save

00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:18.821
real money and participate and have access to that budget.

00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:21.219
But it's not just about policing government.

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:22.946
It's also about creating government.

00:08:22.946 --> 00:08:26.064
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,

00:08:26.064 --> 00:08:28.749
getting you and me to raise the money to build

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:31.407
the goalposts and the park benches that will actually

00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:34.969
allow us to deliver better services in our communities.

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:38.607
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:41.847
to engage in delivering services,

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:44.998
sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.

00:08:44.998 --> 00:08:49.351
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,

00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:53.287
this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able

00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:55.932
to crowdsource and target the delivery of

00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:59.023
better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,

00:08:59.023 --> 00:09:01.479
whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:04.004
or more recently in Italy.

00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:07.135
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter

00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:10.003
is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing

00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:14.039
government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:17.047
Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:18.734
is the opening up of government data,

00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:21.734
not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:25.263
to see this practice of people creating and generating

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:28.732
innovative applications on top of government data.

00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:31.063
There's so many examples I could have picked, and I

00:09:31.063 --> 00:09:34.229
selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you

00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:36.495
may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen

00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:39.256
in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:40.949
and particularly homeless veterans.

00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:43.727
In February, he approached the White House, and said,

00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:47.572
"I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.099
applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:54.534
but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."

00:09:54.534 --> 00:09:57.774
February 2012 to June of 2012,

00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:00.762
the finalists are announced in the competition.

00:10:00.762 --> 00:10:03.751
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,

00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:06.497
getting anything done in a four-month period of time?

00:10:06.497 --> 00:10:08.633
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:11.497
let alone generate real, palpable innovations

00:10:11.497 --> 00:10:13.388
that improve people's lives.

00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:16.621
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government

00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:20.398
revolution is not about privatizing government,

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:23.296
because in many cases what it can do when we have

00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:26.392
the will to do so is to deliver more progressive

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:30.515
and better policy than the regulations and the legislative

00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:33.475
and litigation-oriented strategies

00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:36.075
by which we make policy today.

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:39.802
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,

00:10:39.802 --> 00:10:41.866
from well-driller to florist.

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:45.089
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:48.248
but do not make a flower arrangement without a license,

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.864
because that will land you in jail.

00:10:50.864 --> 00:10:54.881
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,

00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:58.969
using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of

00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:02.530
burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.529
but to replace those regulations with more innovative

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:08.393
alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:10.375
of new iPhone apps that will allows us

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.648
both to protect consumers and the public

00:11:12.648 --> 00:11:16.159
and to encourage economic development.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:19.313
That is a nice sideline of open government.

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:22.024
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard

00:11:22.024 --> 00:11:25.481
to development. It's the economic benefits and the

00:11:25.481 --> 00:11:30.107
job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.927
Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,

00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:34.727
largely owned by the Russian government,

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:37.727
has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging

00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:41.079
its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:45.499
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,

00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:48.256
from open innovation, and they're pushing radically

00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:50.915
the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,

00:11:50.915 --> 00:11:52.958
but into the public sector.

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.699
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using

00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:58.549
open government data, not simply to make apps,

00:11:58.549 --> 00:12:00.611
but then to make companies and to hire people

00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.912
to build them working with the government.

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:05.042
So a lot of these innovations are local.

00:12:05.042 --> 00:12:08.148
In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app

00:12:08.148 --> 00:12:11.705
in which they allow you or me to say we are certified

00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:15.272
CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,

00:12:15.272 --> 00:12:17.512
a notification goes out so that you

00:12:17.512 --> 00:12:21.468
can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.

00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:23.772
The victim who receives bystander CPR

00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:26.237
is more than twice as likely to survive.

00:12:26.237 --> 00:12:29.912
"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.

00:12:29.912 --> 00:12:32.455
But it's not limited to the local.

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:35.116
British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue

00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:38.200
of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.918
with the state in the cocreation of governance.

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:44.979
Let me be very clear,

00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:46.448
and perhaps controversial,

00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:49.237
that open government is not

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.210
about transparent government.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.128
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:55.540
how government works.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.107
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data

00:12:58.107 --> 00:13:01.816
to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change

00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:03.088
government.

00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:06.107
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship

00:13:06.107 --> 00:13:07.835
between civil society and government

00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:10.878
over the control and ownership of information.

00:13:10.878 --> 00:13:13.462
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow

00:13:13.462 --> 00:13:15.874
of money into politics, and arguably,

00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:18.607
it's not even producing accountability as well as it might

00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:22.070
if we took the next step of combining participation and

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.181
collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.918
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases,

00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:32.207
I think. The first phase of the open government revolution

00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:35.983
is delivering better information from the crowd

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.377
into the center.

00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:40.324
Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government

00:13:40.324 --> 00:13:42.278
work in the U.S. really got started,

00:13:42.278 --> 00:13:44.534
I was teaching a patent law class to my students and

00:13:44.534 --> 00:13:48.305
explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy

00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:50.436
has the power to make a decision

00:13:50.436 --> 00:13:54.921
about which patent application becomes the next patent,

00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:57.663
and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights

00:13:57.663 --> 00:14:00.670
over an entire field of inventive activity.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.582
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,

00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:05.975
we can make an expert network, a social network,

00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:08.247
that would connect the network to the institution

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.628
to allow scientists and technologists to get

00:14:10.628 --> 00:14:13.263
better information to the patent office

00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:15.726
to aid in making those decisions.

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:18.358
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.151
and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:23.407
that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out

00:14:23.407 --> 00:14:27.872
universal, complete, and total openness,

00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:30.918
so that all patent applications will now be open

00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:34.586
for citizen participation, beginning this year.

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.522
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah. (Applause)

00:14:37.522 --> 00:14:40.475
They deserve a hand. (Applause)

00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:43.010
The first phase is in getting better information in.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.867
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.

00:14:46.867 --> 00:14:49.482
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced

00:14:49.482 --> 00:14:50.901
in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:53.883
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.

00:14:53.883 --> 00:14:57.419
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.771
as is Lithuania. When we start to see

00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:02.075
power over the core functions of government

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:05.695
— spending, legislation, decision-making —

00:15:05.695 --> 00:15:09.756
then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.

00:15:09.756 --> 00:15:13.587
There are many things that we can do to get us there.

00:15:13.587 --> 00:15:16.250
Obviously opening up the data is one,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.613
but the important thing is to create lots more --

00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:22.843
create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.

00:15:22.843 --> 00:15:25.541
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data

00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:29.250
to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.750
and participate, like the jury is,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.774
but we're going to need lots more things like it.

00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:39.425
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.

00:15:39.425 --> 00:15:42.041
We've heard talk here at TED about people

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:46.110
biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.154
and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting

00:15:49.154 --> 00:15:52.513
young people to build websites and make videos.

00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:55.249
When we start by teaching young people that we live,

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:58.767
not in a passive society, a read-only society,

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:01.334
but in a writable society, where we have the power

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:04.958
to change our communities, to change our institutions,

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.094
that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway

00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:11.305
towards this open government innovation,

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.014
towards this open government movement,

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.537
towards this open government revolution.

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:17.783
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing

00:16:17.783 --> 00:16:23.642
for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.

00:16:23.642 --> 00:16:26.937
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.

00:16:26.937 --> 00:16:29.162
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional

00:16:29.162 --> 00:16:33.529
elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:36.277
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough

00:16:36.277 --> 00:16:39.596
to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity

00:16:39.596 --> 00:16:43.004
that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see

00:16:43.004 --> 00:16:45.707
the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting

00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:48.371
innovations that we hear talked about here at TED,

00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:50.548
in clean energy, in clean education,

00:16:50.548 --> 00:16:53.139
in development, if we want to see those adopted

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:55.395
and we want to see those scaled,

00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:58.187
we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,

00:16:58.187 --> 00:16:59.892
then we must all participate,

00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:01.390
then we must get involved.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.600
We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.794
we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.994
throughout our culture, to create open institutions

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:14.663
to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.

00:17:14.663 --> 00:17:17.566
Thank you. (Applause)
