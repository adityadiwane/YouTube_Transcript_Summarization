00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.119
I am sorry I cannot show you my face,

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.205
because if I do, the bad guys will come for me.

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:26.293
My journey started 14 years ago.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.705
I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:33.407
Then I got a scoop.

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:36.826
The scoop was quite a very simple story.

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:39.430
Police officers were taking bribes

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.966
from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.768
As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:49.937
in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:51.825
since everybody knew that it was happening,

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.394
and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:57.629
So I decided to go there

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.594
and act as a seller.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.847
As part of selling, I was able to document

00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:07.639
the hard core evidence.

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.161
The impact was great.

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.722
It was fantastic.

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:16.452
This was what many call immersion journalism,

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:19.021
or undercover journalism.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.269
I am an undercover journalist.

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:27.990
My journalism is hinged on three basic principles:

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
naming, shaming and jailing.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.660
Journalism is about results.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.399
It's about affecting your community or your society

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.036
in the most progressive way.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:45.594
I have worked on this for over 14 years,

00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:48.826
and I can tell you, the results are very good.

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:51.057
One story that comes to mind

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:53.201
in my undercover pieces

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:55.412
is "Spirit Child."

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:59.488
It was about children who were born with deformities,

00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:02.233
and their parents felt that once they were born

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.922
with those deformities,

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:06.045
they were not good enough to live in the society,

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:09.153
so they were given some concoction to take

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:11.730
and as a result they died.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.547
So I built a prosthetic baby,

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:16.697
and I went into the village,

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:20.845
pretended as though this baby had been born

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:24.932
with a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.

00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:27.507
They got themselves ready.

00:02:27.507 --> 00:02:31.093
In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:33.633
and they came that fateful morning

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.469
to come and kill the child.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.488
I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.408
They put it on fire. It was boiling hot,

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:45.880
getting ready to give to the kids.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.855
Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.528
they were on standby,

00:02:50.528 --> 00:02:53.764
and just as the concoction was ready,

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.864
and they were about to give it to the kids,

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.813
I phoned the police,

00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:02.982
and fortunately they came and busted them.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.934
As I speak now, they are before the courts.

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:07.748
Don't forget the key principles:

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:10.574
naming, shaming and jailing.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:12.587
The court process is taking place,

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:14.670
and I'm very sure at the end of the day

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.119
we will find them, and we will put them

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.862
where they belong too.

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:22.550
Another key story that comes to mind,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.897
which relates to this spirit child phenomenon,

00:03:26.897 --> 00:03:32.373
is "The Spell of the Albinos."

00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:35.864
I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,

00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:38.240
children who are born with albinism

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.293
are sometimes considered as being unfit

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.992
to live in society.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:48.880
Their bodies are chopped up with machetes

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.208
and are supposed to be used for some concoctions

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:55.090
or some potions for people to get money --

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.885
or so many, many stories people would tell about it.

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:01.441
It was time to go undercover again.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.890
So I went undercover as a man who was interested

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.023
in this particular business, of course.

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:09.593
Again, a prosthetic arm was built.

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:13.172
For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera

00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:17.916
the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:20.066
and they were ready to use it to prepare

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:23.730
those potions for people.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.306
I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:30.448
but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government

00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:34.637
could only take action because the evidence was available.

00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:38.532
My journalism is about hard core evidence.

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:40.931
If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence

00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.434
that you have stolen.

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:44.751
I show you how you stole it

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.471
and when, or what you used

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.739
what you had stolen to do.

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:53.309
What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.753
My kind of journalism is a product

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:59.170
of my society.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.348
I know that sometimes

00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:06.020
people have their own criticisms

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.508
about undercover journalism.

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:13.686
(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:16.640
and put it on the table,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.955
so that we should not be afraid.

00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:25.738
He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:29.426
So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:31.816
I didn't utter a word.

00:05:31.816 --> 00:05:33.674
But my colleagues didn't know.

00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:36.895
So after collecting the money,

00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:40.023
when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:43.458
Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:44.975
since I was the leader of the group,

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.972
I told my colleagues that if they come,

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.273
we will arrest them.

00:05:49.273 --> 00:05:53.500
Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.084
I've never stepped there before.

00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:56.051
So I'm surprised.

00:05:56.051 --> 00:06:01.865
You see a hand counting money just in front of me.

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:05.209
The next moment, you see the money in my hands,

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:08.530
counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.095
I have not done any business with anybody.

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.435
Reporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:15.616
Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:18.490
he just smiled and gave this video extract

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.245
he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:25.594
The officer who earlier denied involvement

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.656

they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.

00:06:33.248 --> 00:06:35.858
Anas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.

00:06:35.858 --> 00:06:37.750
And here was him, denying.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.711
But you see, when you have the hard core evidence,

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.071
you are able to affect society.

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.378
Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

John Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says

00:07:31.298 --> 00:07:35.204
is not something which is unknown to many of us,

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:39.308
but please, those of you who are agents,

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:43.891
and who are leading the customs officers into temptation,

00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:48.244
I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say

00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:50.843
any good things to you about this.

00:07:50.843 --> 00:07:53.186
AAA: That was my president.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:55.546
I thought that I couldn't come here

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:58.026
without giving you something special.

00:07:58.026 --> 00:08:01.517
I have a piece, and I'm excited that

00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:05.599
I'm sharing it for the first time with you here.

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:09.705
I have been undercover in the prisons.

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:13.891
I have been there for a long time.

00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:18.920
And I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.821
But again, I can only affect society

00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:25.397
and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.

00:08:25.397 --> 00:08:28.769
Many times, the prison authorities have denied

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:31.317
ever having issues of drug abuse,

00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:35.297
issues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny

00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:36.747
that it ever happens.

00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:40.111
How can you obtain the hard core evidence?

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:44.011
So I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"]

00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:48.197
Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.

00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:51.267
Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:55.823
one of my friends, from his sick bed till death,

00:08:55.823 --> 00:08:59.464
and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.

00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:02.546
There were issues of bad food being served

00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:07.456
as I recall that some of the food I ate

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:11.717
is just not good for a human being.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:15.868
Toilet facilities: very bad.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:20.261
I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend --

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:23.008
and that's what I call proper,

00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:26.417
when four of us are on a manhole.

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:30.157
It is something that if you narrate it to somebody,

00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:31.991
the person wouldn't believe it.

00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:34.197
The only way that you can let the person believe

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.309
is when you show hard core evidence.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.437
Of course, drugs were abundant.

00:09:39.437 --> 00:09:42.182
It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:45.885
faster even, in the prison than outside the prison.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:50.596
Evil in the society is an extreme disease.

00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:52.518
If you have extreme diseases,

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:55.445
you need to get extreme remedies.

00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:58.179
My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents

00:09:58.179 --> 00:09:59.861
or other countries,

00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:03.309
but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:05.517
of Africa, because usually, when people talk

00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:08.242
about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:09.423
Show me the evidence."

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:11.328
I say, "This is the evidence."

00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:16.209
And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:19.729
You see, we on the continent are able

00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:22.313
to tell the story better because we face the conditions

00:10:22.313 --> 00:10:24.713
and we see the conditions.

00:10:24.713 --> 00:10:26.500
That is why I was particularly excited

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.880
when we launched our "Africa Investigates" series

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.081
where we investigated a lot of African countries.

00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:35.732
As a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,

00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:38.270
we are moving on to World Investigates.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.913
By the end of it, a lot more bad guys

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:44.543
on our continent will be put behind bars.

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.170
This will not stop.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.097
I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:52.525
because I know that when evil men destroy,

00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:54.513
good men must build and bind.

00:10:54.513 --> 00:10:55.786
Thank you very much.

00:10:55.786 --> 00:11:04.694
(Applause)

00:11:05.323 --> 00:11:07.021
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:09.269
I have some questions for you.

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:13.499
How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?

00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:15.714
AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about

00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:18.580
setting the priorities right, so we got people

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.418
to take me to court.

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:22.634
So I went through the very legal process,

00:11:22.634 --> 00:11:24.858
because at the end of the day, the prison authorities

00:11:24.858 --> 00:11:27.474
want to check whether indeed you have been there or not,

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:29.488
and that's how I got in there.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:31.266
CA: So someone sued you in court,

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:34.073
and they took you there, and you were in remand custody

00:11:34.073 --> 00:11:36.514
for part of it, and you did that deliberately.

00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:38.205
AAA: Yes, yes.

00:11:38.205 --> 00:11:41.368
CA: Talk to me just about fear

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.177
and how you manage that,

00:11:43.177 --> 00:11:45.810
because you're regularly putting your life at risk.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.373
How do you do that?

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.563
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.

00:11:50.563 --> 00:11:52.777
Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.

00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:55.847
And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear

00:11:55.847 --> 00:11:58.327
whenever I am sure that all the steps

00:11:58.327 --> 00:12:01.520
have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team

00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:04.900
who help ensure that the safety and all the systems

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.845
are put in place, but you've got to take

00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:09.596
very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:12.212
If you don't, you will end up losing your life.

00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:14.716
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place,

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:16.804
I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,

00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:19.460
but it's a hazard of a profession.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.013
I mean, everybody has their hazard.

00:12:21.013 --> 00:12:22.946
And once you say that is yours,

00:12:22.946 --> 00:12:25.254
you've got to take it, as and when it comes.

00:12:25.254 --> 00:12:27.945
CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work

00:12:27.945 --> 00:12:29.215
and you've taught us a story

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:32.462
like no story I think any of us have heard before.

00:12:32.462 --> 00:12:36.306
And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.

00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:37.430
AAA: Thank you.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.702
CA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)
