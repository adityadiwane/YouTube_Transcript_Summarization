00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:27.976
I bet you're worried.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.976
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.274
I was worried.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.829
That's why I began this piece.

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:36.841
I was worried about vaginas.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:39.976
I was worried what we think about vaginas

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.242
and even more worried
that we don't think about them.

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:45.829
I was worried about my own vagina.

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:50.285
It needed a context, a culture,
a community of other vaginas.

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:54.720
There is so much darkness
and secrecy surrounding them.

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:59.392
Like the Bermuda Triangle,
nobody ever reports back from there.

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:00.518
(Laughter)

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:04.335
In the first place, it's not so easy
to even find your vagina.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.668
Women go days, weeks, months,
without looking at it.

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.461
I interviewed a high-powered
businesswoman;

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.977
she told me she didn't have time.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.855
"Looking at your vagina,"
she said, "is a full day's work."

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.976
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.096
"You've got to get down there
on your back, in front of a mirror,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.419
full-length preferred.

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:24.545
You've got to get in the perfect position
with the perfect light,

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.976
which then becomes shadowed
by the angle you're at.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.211
You're twisting your head up,
arching your back, it's exhausting."

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.354
She was busy; she didn't have time.

00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:35.703
So I decided to talk to women
about their vaginas.

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:39.036
They began as casual vagina interviews,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.740
and they turned into vagina monologues.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:43.984
I talked with over 200 women.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:46.409
I talked to older women, younger women,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.139
married women, lesbians, single women.

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:53.976
I talked to corporate professionals,
college professors, actors, sex workers.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.507
I talked to African-American women,
Asian-American women,

00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:01.389
Native-American women,
Caucasian women, Jewish women.

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:06.592
OK, at first women were a little shy,
a little reluctant to talk.

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:09.724
Once they got going,
you couldn't stop them.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.458
Women love to talk
about their vaginas, they do.

00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.560
Mainly because no one's ever
asked them before.

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:17.654
(Laughter)

00:02:17.678 --> 00:02:22.585
Let's just start with the word
"vagina" -- vagina, vagina.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.195
It sounds like an infection, at best.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.576
Maybe a medical instrument.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:30.445
(Laughter)

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.040
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.603
It doesn't matter how many times
you say the word,

00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:36.976
it never sounds like a word
you want to say.

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:41.482
It's a completely ridiculous,
totally un-sexy word.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.071
If you use it during sex,
trying to be politically correct,

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:48.306
"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.423
you kill the act right there.

00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:52.117
(Laughter)

00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:55.439
I'm worried what we call them
and don't call them.

00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:58.551
In Great Neck, New York,
they call it a Pussycat.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.976
A woman told me there
her mother used to tell her,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.408
"Don't wear panties, dear,
underneath your pajamas.

00:03:03.432 --> 00:03:05.218
You need to air out your Pussycat."

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:08.976
(Laughter)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.690
In Westchester, they call it a Pooki,

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:13.514
in New Jersey, a twat.

00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:18.188
There's Powderbox, derriere,
a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:22.687
a Poopelu, a Pooninana,
a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:24.163
(Laughter)

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:29.587
There's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi,
Dignity, Coochi Snorcher,

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:34.457
Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.976
Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.206
Mongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox,
a Mimi in Miami,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.337
a Split Knish in Philadelphia ...

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.448
(Laughter)

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:50.358
and a Schmende in the Bronx.

00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:51.574
(Laughter)

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.547
I am worried about vaginas.

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:56.848
This is how the "Vagina
Monologues" begins.

00:03:57.444 --> 00:04:00.050
But it really didn't begin there.

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:03.398
It began with a conversation with a woman.

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:06.212
We were having a conversation
about menopause,

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:08.267
and we got onto the subject of her vagina,

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.640
which you'll do if you're
talking about menopause.

00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:13.602
And she said things that really
shocked me about her vagina --

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:15.745
that it was dried-up
and finished and dead --

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.022
and I was kind of shocked.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.720
So I said to a friend casually,

00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:20.798
"Well, what do you think
about your vagina?"

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:22.840
And that woman said
something more amazing,

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:25.298
and then the next woman said
something more amazing,

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:27.566
and before I knew it,
every woman was telling me

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.667
I had to talk to somebody
about their vagina

00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:31.318
because they had an amazing story,

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:33.225
and I was sucked down the vagina trail.

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.559
(Laughter)

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:37.016
And I really haven't gotten off of it.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.148
I think if you had told me
when I was younger

00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:41.560
that I was going to grow up,
and be in shoe stores,

00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:44.450
and people would scream out,
"There she is, the Vagina Lady!"

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:47.111
I don't know that that would have
been my life ambition.

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:48.138
(Laughter)

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:50.409
But I want to talk a little bit
about happiness,

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.786
and the relationship
to this whole vagina journey,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.890
because it has been
an extraordinary journey

00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:56.606
that began eight years ago.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.896
I think before I did
the "Vagina Monologues,"

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.724
I didn't really believe in happiness.

00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:04.774
I thought that only idiots
were happy, to be honest.

00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:08.592
I remember when I started
practicing Buddhism 14 years ago,

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:11.819
and I was told that the end
of this practice was to be happy,

00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:15.191
I said, "How could you be happy
and live in this world of suffering

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:17.027
and live in this world of pain?"

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.976
I mistook happiness
for a lot of other things,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.278
like numbness or decadence or selfishness.

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:27.690
And what happened through the course
of the "Vagina Monologues"

00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:30.251
and this journey is,
I think I have come to understand

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:32.514
a little bit more about happiness.

00:05:32.538 --> 00:05:34.976
There are three qualities
I want to talk about.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.913
One is seeing what's
right in front of you,

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:41.395
and talking about it, and stating it.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.976
I think what I learned
from talking about the vagina

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.143
and speaking about the vagina,
is it was the most obvious thing --

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.406
it was right in the center of my body
and the center of the world --

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.206
and yet it was the one thing
nobody talked about.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.483
The second thing is that what talking
about the vagina did

00:05:57.507 --> 00:06:00.418
is it opened this door
which allowed me to see

00:06:00.442 --> 00:06:03.463
that there was a way to serve
the world to make it better.

00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:06.976
And that's where the deepest happiness
has actually come from.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.707
And the third principle of happiness,
which I've realized recently:

00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:14.976
Eight years ago, this momentum
and this energy, this "V-wave" started --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.230
and I can only describe it
as a "V-wave" because, to be honest,

00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:21.976
I really don't understand it completely;
I feel at the service of it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.976
But this wave started,
and if I question the wave,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.438
or try to stop the wave
or look back at the wave,

00:06:28.462 --> 00:06:30.976
I often have the experience of whiplash

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.252
or the potential of my neck breaking.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.626
But if I go with the wave,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.044
and I trust the wave
and I move with the wave,

00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:41.575
I go to the next place, and it happens
logically and organically and truthfully.

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:47.301
And I started this piece, particularly
with stories and narratives,

00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:50.159
and I was talking to one woman
and that led to another woman

00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:52.001
and that led to another woman.

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:53.870
And then I wrote those stories down,

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:56.096
and I put them out
in front of other people.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.692
And every single time
I did the show at the beginning,

00:06:58.716 --> 00:07:01.394
women would literally
line up after the show,

00:07:01.418 --> 00:07:03.653
because they wanted
to tell me their stories.

00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:06.987
And at first I thought, "Oh great,
I'll hear about wonderful orgasms,

00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.613
and great sex lives, and how women
love their vaginas."

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.976
But in fact, that's not
what women lined up to tell me.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.402
What women lined up to tell me
was how they were raped,

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:18.904
and how they were battered,
and how they were beaten,

00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:21.086
and how they were gang-raped
in parking lots,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.131
and how they were incested
by their uncles.

00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:25.853
And I wanted to stop doing
the "Vagina Monologues,"

00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:27.282
because it felt too daunting.

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:30.773
I felt like a war photographer
who takes pictures of terrible events,

00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:33.156
but doesn't intervene on their behalf.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.397
And so in 1997, I said,
"Let's get women together.

00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:39.597
What could we do with this information

00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:42.165
that all these women are being violated?"

00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:45.722
And it turned out, after thinking
and investigating,

00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:49.143
that I discovered -- and the UN
has actually said this recently --

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.976
that one out of every three
women on this planet

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.580
will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.

00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:56.667
That's essentially a gender;

00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:00.086
that's essentially the resource
of the planet, which is women.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.282
So in 1997 we got all these incredible
women together and we said,

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:07.421
"How can we use the play, this energy,
to stop violence against women?"

00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:10.446
And we put on one event
in New York City, in the theater,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.061
and all these great actors
came -- from Susan Sarandon,

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:14.895
to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:17.759
and we did one performance on one evening,

00:08:17.783 --> 00:08:21.638
and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.051
And within five years,

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:26.540
this extraordinary thing began to happen.

00:08:26.564 --> 00:08:29.976
One woman took that energy and she said,
"I want to bring this wave,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.565
this energy, to college campuses,"

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:34.607
and so she took the play and she said,

00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:37.804
"Let's use the play and have
performances once a year,

00:08:37.828 --> 00:08:40.417
where we can raise money
to stop violence against women

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:42.651
in local communities
all around the world."

00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:45.834
And in one year, it went to 50 colleges,
and then it expanded.

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.447
And over the course of the last six years,

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:51.747
it's spread and it's spread
and it's spread around the world.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.981
What I have learned is two things:

00:08:56.005 --> 00:09:01.976
one, that the epidemic of violence
towards women is shocking; it's global;

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.048
it is so profound
and it is so devastating,

00:09:04.072 --> 00:09:06.976
and it is so in every little pocket
of every little crater,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.667
of every little society
that we don't even recognize it,

00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.191
because it's become ordinary.

00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:14.755
This journey has taken me to Afghanistan,

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.508
where I had the extraordinary
honor and privilege

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:21.857
to go into parts of Afghanistan
under the Taliban.

00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:25.525
I was dressed in a burqa and I went in
with an extraordinary group,

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:28.918
called the Revolutionary Association
of the Women of Afghanistan.

00:09:28.942 --> 00:09:31.976
And I saw firsthand
how women had been stripped

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.165
of every single right that was possible
to strip women of --

00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:38.696
from being educated, to being employed,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.346
to being actually allowed
to eat ice cream.

00:09:41.723 --> 00:09:43.264
For those of you who don't know,

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:45.636
it was illegal to eat ice cream
under the Taliban.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.436
And I actually saw and met
women who had been flogged

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.771
for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.

00:09:51.795 --> 00:09:56.197
I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating
place in a little town,

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.064
where we went to a back room,
and women were seated

00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:02.820
and a curtain was pulled around us,
and they were served vanilla ice cream.

00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:06.260
And women lifted their burqas
and ate this ice cream.

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:09.404
And I don't think I ever understood
pleasure until that moment,

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:12.976
and how women have found a way
to keep their pleasure alive.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.548
It has taken me, this journey,
to Islamabad,

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:19.209
where I have witnessed and met women
with their faces melted off.

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:23.085
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico,
where I was a week ago,

00:10:23.109 --> 00:10:25.730
where I have literally been
there in parking lots,

00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:27.603
where bones of women have washed up

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.196
and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:34.675
It has taken me to universities
all over this country,

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:37.191
where girls are date-raped and drugged.

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:40.976
I have seen terrible, terrible,
terrible violence.

00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:45.279
But I have also recognized,
in the course of seeing that violence,

00:10:45.303 --> 00:10:49.921
that being in the face of things
and seeing actually what's in front of us

00:10:49.945 --> 00:10:52.781
is the antidote to depression,

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:55.976
and to a feeling that one
is worthless and has no value.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.976
Because before the "Vagina Monologues,"

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.976
I will say that 80 percent
of my consciousness was closed off

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.834
to what was really going on
in this reality,

00:11:03.858 --> 00:11:08.180
and that closing-off closed off
my vitality and my life energy.

00:11:08.707 --> 00:11:11.517
What has also happened
is in the course of these travels --

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:14.073
and it's been an extraordinary thing --

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:16.987
is that every single place
that I have gone to in the world,

00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:18.423
I have met a new species.

00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:22.161
And I really love hearing about all
these species at the bottom of the sea.

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:25.544
And I was thinking about how being
with these extraordinary people

00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:27.202
on this particular panel,

00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:29.976
that it's beneath, beyond and between,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.976
and the vagina kind of fits
into all those categories.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.462
(Laughter)

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.976
But one of the things
I've seen is this species --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.975
and it is a species,
and it is a new paradigm,

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.633
and it doesn't get reported
in the press or in the media

00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:45.695
because I don't think
good news ever is news,

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:48.362
and I don't think people
who are transforming the planet

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:51.267
are what gets the ratings on TV shows.

00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:53.315
But every single country I have been to --

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:56.244
and in the last six years,
I've been to about 45 countries,

00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:59.322
and many tiny little villages
and cities and towns --

00:11:59.346 --> 00:12:03.094
I have seen something what I've come
to call "vagina warriors."

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:07.293
A "vagina warrior" is a woman,
or a vagina-friendly man,

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:10.911
who has witnessed incredible
violence or suffered it,

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:15.306
and rather than getting an AK-47
or a weapon of mass destruction

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.770
or a machete,

00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:20.531
they hold the violence in their bodies;

00:12:20.555 --> 00:12:24.659
they grieve it; they experience it;
and then they go out

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:28.916
and devote their lives to making sure
it doesn't happen to anybody else.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.660
I have met these women
everywhere on the planet,

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.446
and I want to tell a few stories,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.976
because I believe that stories are the way
that we transmit information,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.193
where it goes into our bodies.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:43.184
And I think one of the things about being
at TED that's been very interesting

00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:45.118
is that I live in my body a lot,

00:12:45.142 --> 00:12:47.384
and I don't live in my head
very much anymore.

00:12:47.408 --> 00:12:49.217
And this is a very heady place.

00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:51.687
And it's been really interesting
to be in my head

00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:54.429
for the last two days;
I've been very disoriented --

00:12:54.453 --> 00:12:55.454
(Laughter)

00:12:55.478 --> 00:12:58.976
because I think the world, the V-world,
is very much in your body.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.828
It's a body world, and the species
really exists in the body.

00:13:02.852 --> 00:13:07.161
And I think there's a real significance
in us attaching our bodies to our heads,

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:10.291
that that separation has created a divide

00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:13.821
that is often separating
purpose from intent.

00:13:13.845 --> 00:13:16.991
And the connection between body and head

00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:19.259
often brings those things into union.

00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:22.782
I want to talk about three
particular people that I've met,

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:26.355
vagina warriors, who really
transformed my understanding

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:28.339
of this whole principle and species,

00:13:28.363 --> 00:13:30.703
and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.

00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:34.312
Marsha Lopez was a woman
I met in Guatemala.

00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:37.364
She was 14 years old,
and she was in a marriage

00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:40.388
and her husband was beating her
on a regular basis.

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:41.881
And she couldn't get out,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:44.023
because she was addicted
to the relationship,

00:13:44.047 --> 00:13:45.325
and she had no money.

00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:47.818
Her sister was younger than her,
and she applied --

00:13:47.842 --> 00:13:51.976
we had a "Stop Rape" contest
a few years ago in New York --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.976
and she applied, hoping
that she would become a finalist

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.842
and she could bring her sister.

00:13:56.866 --> 00:14:00.976
She did become a finalist;
she brought Marsha to New York.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.245
And at that time,

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:04.960
we did this extraordinary V-Day
at Madison Square Garden,

00:14:04.984 --> 00:14:08.045
where we sold out the entire
testosterone-filled dome --

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:11.656
18,000 people standing up
to say "Yes" to vaginas,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.414
which was really a pretty
incredible transformation.

00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.257
And she came, and she witnessed this,

00:14:16.281 --> 00:14:19.367
and she decided that she would go back
and leave her husband,

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.454
and that she would bring
V-Day to Guatemala.

00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:23.051
She was 21 years old.

00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:28.269
I went to Guatemala and she had sold out
the National Theater of Guatemala.

00:14:28.293 --> 00:14:32.727
And I watched her walk up on stage
in her red short dress and high heels,

00:14:32.751 --> 00:14:36.232
and she stood there and said,
"My name is Marsha.

00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:40.017
I was beaten by my husband for five years.
He almost murdered me.

00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:42.198
I left and you can, too."

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:45.802
And the entire 2,000 people
went absolutely crazy.

00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:49.817
There's a woman named Esther Chávez
who I met in Juarez, Mexico.

00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:53.076
And Esther Chávez was
a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.155
She was 72 years old
and she was planning to retire.

00:14:56.527 --> 00:15:00.101
She went to Juarez
to take care of an ailing aunt,

00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:03.197
and in the course of it, she began
to discover what was happening

00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:06.590
to the murdered and disappeared
women of Juarez.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.336
She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.453
She started to write the stories
which documented the disappeared women.

00:15:13.477 --> 00:15:17.092
300 women have disappeared in a border
town because they're brown and poor.

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.378
There has been no response
to the disappearance,

00:15:19.402 --> 00:15:21.639
and not one person
has been held accountable.

00:15:21.663 --> 00:15:23.177
She began to document it.

00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:26.780
She opened a center called
Casa Amiga, and in six years,

00:15:26.804 --> 00:15:30.164
she has literally brought this
to the consciousness of the world.

00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:31.577
We were there a week ago,

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:35.287
when there were 7,000 people
in the street, and it was truly a miracle.

00:15:35.311 --> 00:15:37.151
And as we walked through the streets,

00:15:37.175 --> 00:15:40.386
the people of Juarez, who normally
don't even come into the streets,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.188
because the streets are so dangerous,

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:43.824
literally stood there and wept,

00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:46.389
to see that other people
from the world had showed up

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.099
for that particular community.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.533
There's another woman, named Agnes.

00:15:50.557 --> 00:15:55.218
And Agnes, for me, epitomizes
what a vagina warrior is.

00:15:55.242 --> 00:15:57.992
I met her three years ago in Kenya.

00:15:58.016 --> 00:16:00.976
And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.609
she was circumcised against her will
when she was 10 years old,

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:07.133
and she really made a decision

00:16:07.157 --> 00:16:10.976
that she didn't want this practice
to continue anymore in her community.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.111
So when she got older,
she created this incredible thing:

00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:19.428
it's an anatomical sculpture
of a woman's body, half a woman's body.

00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:21.580
And she walked through the Rift Valley,

00:16:21.604 --> 00:16:24.976
and she had vagina
and vagina replacement parts,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.829
where she would teach girls
and parents and boys and girls

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:31.309
what a healthy vagina looks like,
and what a mutilated vagina looks like.

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:32.976
And in the course of her travel --

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.039
she walked literally for eight years
through the Rift Valley,

00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.324
through dust, through sleeping
on the ground,

00:16:38.348 --> 00:16:40.523
because the Maasai are nomads,

00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:43.976
and she would have to find them,
and they would move,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.638
and she would find them again --

00:16:45.662 --> 00:16:48.557
she saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:51.527
And in that time, she created
an alternative ritual,

00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:54.876
which involved girls
coming of age without the cut.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.976
When we met her three years ago,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.913
we said, "What could V-Day do for you?"

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:02.553
And she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep,
I could get around a lot faster."

00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:03.578
(Laughter)

00:17:03.602 --> 00:17:04.917
So we bought her a jeep.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:09.223
And in the year that she had the jeep,
she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.012
So we said to her,
"What else could we do for you?"

00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:14.298
She said, "Well, Eve,
if you gave me some money,

00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:16.472
I could open a house
and girls could run away,

00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.890
and they could be saved."

00:17:18.224 --> 00:17:21.105
And I want to tell this little story
about my own beginnings,

00:17:21.129 --> 00:17:25.423
because it's very interrelated
to happiness and Agnes.

00:17:25.447 --> 00:17:29.131
When I was a little girl --
I grew up in a wealthy community;

00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:32.376
it was an upper-middle class
white community,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.259
and it had all the trappings and the looks

00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:38.918
of a perfectly nice,
wonderful, great life.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.886
And everyone was supposed
to be happy in that community,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.491
and, in fact, my life was hell.

00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:45.048
I lived with an alcoholic father

00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:47.976
who beat me and molested me,
and it was all inside that.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.976
And always as a child I had this fantasy
that somebody would come and rescue me.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.620
And I actually made up a little character
whose name was Mr. Alligator.

00:17:56.644 --> 00:17:58.976
I would call him up
when things got really bad,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.163
and say it was time
to come and pick me up.

00:18:01.187 --> 00:18:04.976
And I would pack a little bag
and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.182
Now, Mr. Alligator never did come,

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:11.680
but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming
actually saved my sanity

00:18:11.704 --> 00:18:13.466
and made it OK for me to keep going,

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.221
because I believed, in the distance,

00:18:15.245 --> 00:18:17.976
there would be someone
coming to rescue me.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.469
Cut to 40-some odd years later,

00:18:20.493 --> 00:18:23.723
we go to Kenya, and we're walking,

00:18:23.747 --> 00:18:26.125
we arrive at the opening of this house.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.907
And Agnes hadn't let me come
to the house for days,

00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:31.084
because they were preparing
this whole ritual.

00:18:31.108 --> 00:18:32.698
I want to tell you a great story.

00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:34.344
When Agnes first started fighting

00:18:34.368 --> 00:18:36.869
to stop female genital mutilation
in her community,

00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:40.432
she had become an outcast,
and she was exiled and slandered,

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:42.487
and the whole community
turned against her.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:44.869
But being a vagina warrior,
she kept going,

00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:48.242
and she kept committing herself
to transforming consciousness.

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:49.874
And in the Maasai community,

00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:52.699
goats and cows are the most
valued possession.

00:18:52.723 --> 00:18:56.976
They're like the Mercedes-Benz
of the Rift Valley.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.886
And she said two days
before the house opened,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.773
two different people arrived
to give her a goat each,

00:19:02.797 --> 00:19:03.948
and she said to me,

00:19:03.972 --> 00:19:08.378
"I knew then that female genital
mutilation would end one day in Africa."

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:12.484
Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,

00:19:12.508 --> 00:19:16.238
there were hundreds of girls
dressed in red homemade dresses --

00:19:16.262 --> 00:19:19.172
which is the color of the Maasai
and the color of V-Day --

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:20.538
and they greeted us.

00:19:20.562 --> 00:19:23.014
They had made up these songs
that they were singing,

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:25.591
about the end of suffering
and the end of mutilation,

00:19:25.615 --> 00:19:27.310
and they walked us down the path.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.699
It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,

00:19:29.723 --> 00:19:32.176
and the dust was flying
and the girls were dancing,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.726
and there was this house, and it said,
"V-Day Safe House for the Girls."

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:42.052
And it hit me in that moment
that it had taken 47 years,

00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:44.679
but that Mr. Alligator
had finally shown up.

00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:47.101
And he had shown up, obviously,

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:50.521
in a form that it took me
a long time to understand,

00:19:50.545 --> 00:19:55.651
which is that when we give in the world
what we want the most,

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:58.976
we heal the broken part inside each of us.

00:19:59.483 --> 00:20:01.857
And I feel, in the last eight years,

00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:04.976
that this journey --
this miraculous vagina journey --

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.802
has taught me this really simple thing,

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:12.249
which is that happiness exists in action;

00:20:12.273 --> 00:20:16.408
it exists in telling the truth
and saying what your truth is;

00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:19.976
and it exists in giving away
what you want the most.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.976
And I feel that knowledge and that journey

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.453
has been an extraordinary privilege,

00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:28.071
and I feel really blessed

00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:30.515
to have been here today
to communicate that to you.

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:31.704
Thank you very much.

00:20:31.728 --> 00:20:33.904
(Applause)
