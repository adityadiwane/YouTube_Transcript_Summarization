00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.563
Four years ago today, exactly, actually,

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.659
I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.779
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.654
for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:29.845
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:32.985
the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.232
and the MS Paint quality of my slides

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:38.544
was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:40.160
and has nothing to do with my inability

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.505
to use PowerPoint. (Laughter)

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:48.065
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.936
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.352
what makes a strong female character,

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.440
and, you know, movies and TV shows,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.706
these things have influence. My own website.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.497
So I think the question of what makes a strong female

00:01:02.497 --> 00:01:04.874
character often goes misinterpreted,

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:08.167
and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.759
who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.352
like a Catwoman type,

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:18.230
or she plays her sexuality up a lot,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.422
and it's seen as power.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:22.821
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.

00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:24.549
They're completely flat,

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.033
and they're basically cardboard characters.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.850
The problem with this is that then

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.712
people expect women to be that easy to understand,

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:35.039
and women are mad at themselves

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.381
for not being that simple,

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.338
when, in actuality, women are complicated,

00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:42.736
women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.488
but because people are crazy,

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:48.150
and women happen to be people. (Laughter)

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.420
So the flaws are the key.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:52.278
I'm not the first person to say this.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.326
What makes a strong female character

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:59.230
is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.214
who is maybe not immediately likable,

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:03.676
but eventually relatable.

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:05.145
I don't like to acknowledge a problem

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.811
without also acknowledging those who work to fix it,

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.878
so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"

00:02:10.878 --> 00:02:13.758
movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:17.889
or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.105
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO

00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:24.296
that premiers next month, "Girls,"

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:26.813
she said she wanted to start it because she felt that

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.801
every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:32.009
and that feels accurate for all people,

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.673
but you don't see women represented like that as much.

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:38.257
Congrats, guys. (Laughs)

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.960
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.496
of women who are not represented that way,

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.952
and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,

00:02:46.952 --> 00:02:50.232
because I think teenagers are especially contradictory

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.272
and still figuring it out,

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.621
and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"

00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:59.400
and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.056
Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.744
I mean, the whole premise of the shows

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:08.190
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.288
but those shows only lasted a season each,

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:16.250
and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.636
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.093
around the time when I was,

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:26.750
when I started watching those TV shows.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.945
I was ending middle school, starting high school --

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.209
I'm a sophomore now —

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.965
and I was trying to reconcile

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:36.624
all of these differences that you're told you can't be

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:37.971
when you're growing up as a girl.

00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.591
You can't be smart and pretty.

00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:43.414
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:47.308
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake

00:03:47.308 --> 00:03:50.341
of what other people, usually men, will think of you.

00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:53.312
So I was trying to figure all that out,

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:56.613
and I felt a little confused,

00:03:56.613 --> 00:03:58.355
and I said so on my blog,

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:02.540
and I said that I wanted to start

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.044
a website for teenage girls

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.482
that was not this kind of one-dimensional

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:11.186
strong character empowerment thing

00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:14.176
because I think one thing that can be very alienating

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.808
about a misconception of feminism is that

00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:20.403
girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to

00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:22.894
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:26.305
never being insecure, never having doubts,

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:29.207
having all of the answers. And this is not true,

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:33.260
and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.003
became easier once I understood that feminism

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.206
was not a rulebook but a discussion,

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:41.330
a conversation, a process,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.501
and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.851
when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit

00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:49.954
on the illustration front since.

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:53.928
But, yeah.

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:58.343
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication

00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:00.832
for teenage girls and ask people to submit

00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:02.937
their writing, their photography, whatever,

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:04.603
to be a member of our staff.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:07.527
I got about 3,000 emails.

00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:10.199
My editorial director and I went through them and

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.202
put together a staff of people,

00:05:13.202 --> 00:05:15.802
and we launched last September.

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:18.157
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,

00:05:18.157 --> 00:05:21.511
where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,

00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.240
we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.199
give girls the answers, and not even give them permission

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.773
to find the answers themselves,

00:05:30.773 --> 00:05:32.941
but hopefully inspire them to understand that

00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:34.664
they can give themselves that permission,

00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:37.548
they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:40.299
all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:45.642
a nice place for all of that to be figured out.

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:47.577
So I'm not saying, "Be like us,"

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.945
and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:55.057
but we just want to help represent girls

00:05:55.057 --> 00:05:58.078
in a way that shows those different dimensions.

00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:01.872
I mean, we have articles called

00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:05.054
"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:07.021
but we also have articles like,

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:10.982
oops -- I'm figuring it out!

00:06:10.982 --> 00:06:13.508
Ha ha. (Laughter)

00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:17.306
If you use that, you can get away with anything.

00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:18.497
We also have articles called

00:06:18.497 --> 00:06:22.003
"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."

00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:25.036
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate

00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:29.003
those characters in movies and

00:06:29.003 --> 00:06:30.816
articles like that on our site,

00:06:30.816 --> 00:06:34.059
that aren't just about being totally powerful,

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.109
maybe finding your acceptance with yourself

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:42.668
and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:46.286
So what I you to take away from my talk,

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:50.508
the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.

00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:53.882
Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)

00:06:53.882 --> 00:06:56.761
Because my favorite thing about her,

00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:59.821
other than, like, everything, is that

00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:02.229
she is very -- has always been

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.134
unapologetically present on stage,

00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:07.941
and unapologetic about her flaws

00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.079
and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:15.671
and she makes you listen to them and think about them,

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.053
and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.

00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:22.151
Thank you. (Applause)
