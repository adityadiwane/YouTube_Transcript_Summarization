00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.292
When we think of Nepal,

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.747
we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:19.019
of the Himalayas,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.468
the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:25.514
or the huge expanse of its grasslands.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.721
What some of us may not realize

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.045
is that in the Himalayan foothills,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:32.219
where the climate is much warmer

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.307
and the landscape much greener,

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:36.733
there lives a great diversity of wildlife,

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.469
including the one-horned rhinoceros,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.143
the Asian elephant

00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:43.218
and the Bengal tiger.

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:45.070
But unfortunately, these animals

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.733
are under constant threat from poachers

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.045
who hunt and kill them for their body parts.

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:53.254
To stop the killing of these animals,

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.852
battalions of soldiers and rangers

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:59.101
are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.726
but that is not an easy task,

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.397
because these soldiers have to patrol

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.388
thousands of hectares of forests on foot

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:08.029
or elephant backs.

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.514
It is also risky for these soldiers

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.895
when they get into gunfights with poachers,

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.911
and therefore Nepal is always looking

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.207
for new ways to help with protecting the forests

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:20.184
and wildlife.

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:22.693
Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:25.406
in the fight against wildlife crime,

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:27.112
and these are drones,

00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:30.386
or more specifically, conservation drones.

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:32.900
For about a year now, my colleagues and I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.160
have been building drones for Nepal

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.658
and training the park protection personnel

00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:39.636
on the use of these drones.

00:01:39.636 --> 00:01:41.268
Not only does a drone give you

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.742
a bird's-eye view of the landscape,

00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:46.777
but it also allows you to capture detailed,

00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:50.759
high-resolution images of objects on the ground.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.268
This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros

00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:57.205
taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day

00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:59.168
in the lowlands of Nepal.

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.399
Now we believe that drones have

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.207
tremendous potential,

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:05.985
not only for combating wildlife crime,

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.948
but also for monitoring the health

00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:10.487
of these wildlife populations.

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:12.337
So what is a drone?

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:14.846
Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:16.947
is simply a model aircraft

00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:19.392
fitted with an autopilot system,

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:23.661
and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.715
a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.974
and a few other sensors.

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:31.393
Now a drone like this

00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:33.599
is meant to carry a useful payload,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.382
such as a video camera

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:37.370
or a photographic camera.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.719
It also requires a software that allows the user

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.420
to program a mission,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.826
to tell the drone where to go.

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.903
Now people I talk to are often surprised

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:49.234
when they hear that these are the only

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:52.341
four components that make a conservation drone,

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:53.845
but they are even more surprised

00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:57.345
when I tell them how affordable
these components are.

00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:59.631
The facts is, a conservation drone

00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:01.890
doesn't cost very much more than

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.867
a good laptop computer

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:07.126
or a decent pair of binoculars.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:10.098
So now that you've built
your own conservation drone,

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:12.260
you probably want to go fly it,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.193
but how does one fly a drone?

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.785
Well, actually, you don't,

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.275
because the drone flies itself.

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.405
All you have to do is to program a mission

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.665
to tell the drone where to fly.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:25.984
But you simply do that by clicking on

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:29.233
a few way points on the Google Maps interface

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.483
using the open-source software.

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:33.430
Those missions could be as simple

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.456
as just a few way points,

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.833
or they could be slightly longer
and more complicated,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.254
to fly along a river system.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:45.103
Sometimes, we fly the drone
in a lawnmower-type pattern

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:47.223
and take pictures of that area,

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:49.194
and those pictures can be processed

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:51.933
to produce a map of that forest.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.536
Other researchers might want to fly the drone

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:56.678
along the boundaries of a forest

00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:58.849
to watch out for poachers or people

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.767
who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:03.647
Now whatever your mission is,

00:04:03.647 --> 00:04:05.120
once you've programmed it,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.103
you simply upload it to the autopilot system,

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.743
bring your drone to the field,

00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:12.958
and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.300
And often we'll go about this mission

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.360
taking pictures or videos along the way,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.294
and usually at that point,

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:22.511
we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.441
sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,

00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:28.952
although some of us sit back
and panic for the next few minutes

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:31.170
worrying that the drone will not return.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.443
Usually it does, and when it does,

00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:36.849
it even lands automatically.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.756
So what can we do with a conservation drone?

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:43.149
Well, when we built our first prototype drone,

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.667
our main objective was to fly it over

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.556
a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.605
to look for the nest of a species of great ape

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.761
known as the orangutan.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.417
The reason we wanted to do that was because

00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.446
we needed to know how many individuals

00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:02.833
of this species are still left in that forest.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.019
Now the traditional method of surveying

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:08.621
for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.508
carrying heavy equipment

00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:14.158
and to use a pair of binoculars
to look up in the treetops

00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:17.576
where you might find an orangutan or its nest.

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.302
Now as you can imagine,

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:22.272
that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:23.990
and costly process,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.786
so we were hoping that drones

00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:29.111
could significantly reduce the cost of surveying

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.678
for orangutan populations in Indonesia

00:05:31.678 --> 00:05:34.145
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:36.500
So we were very excited when we captured

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.670
our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.834
And this is it; this is the first ever picture

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:45.874
of orangutan nests taken with a drone.

00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.898
Since then we have taken pictures

00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:49.516
of dozens of these nests

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.285
from around various parts of Southeast Asia,

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.528
and we're now working with computer scientists

00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:58.447
to develop algorithms that can automatically count

00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:00.464
the number of nests from the thousands

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:03.583
of photos we've collected so far.

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:05.541
But nests are not the only objects

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.331
these drones can detect.

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:09.640
This is a wild orangutan

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.161
happily feeding on top of a palm tree,

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.713
seemingly oblivious to our drone
that was flying overhead,

00:06:15.713 --> 00:06:18.097
not once but several times.

00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:21.115
We've also taken pictures of other animals

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:24.236
including forest buffalos in Gabon,

00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:27.451
elephants, and even turtle nests.

00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:30.991
But besides taking pictures
of just the animals themselves,

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.992
we also take pictures of the habitats
these animals live in,

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:36.606
because we want to keep track

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:39.560
of the health of these habitats.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.779
Sometimes, we zoom out a little

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.032
and look at other things that might be happening

00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:45.496
in the landscape.

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:48.796
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:52.038
Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation

00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:53.560
in that part of the world,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.617
so we wanted to use this new drone technology

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:59.732
to keep track of the spread of these plantations

00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:01.742
in Southeast Asia.

00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:04.105
But drones could also be used to keep track of

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:06.589
illegal logging activities.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.030
This is a recently logged forest,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.385
again in Sumatra.

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:12.544
You could even still see the processed

00:07:12.544 --> 00:07:16.172
wooden planks left on the ground.

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:18.461
But perhaps the most exciting part

00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:21.027
about taking pictures from the air is

00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.453
we could later stitch these pictures together

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:26.316
using special software to create a map

00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:29.083
of the entire landscape, and this map

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.098
gives us crucial information

00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.366
for monitoring land use change,

00:07:33.366 --> 00:07:37.113
to let us know where and when
plantations might be expanding,

00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:39.390
where forests might be contracting,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.772
or where fires might be breaking out.

00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:45.004
Aerial images could also be processed

00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:47.313
to produce three-dimensional

00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:49.310
computer models of forests.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.263
Now these models are not just visually appealing,

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.764
but they are also geometrically accurate,

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.541
which means researchers can now measure

00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.666
the distance between trees,

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.961
calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:06.160
and so on, all of which are important information

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.473
for monitoring the health of these forests.

00:08:09.473 --> 00:08:11.926
Recently, we've also begun experimenting

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:13.990
with thermal imaging cameras.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.879
Now these cameras can detect

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.853
heat-emitting objects from the ground,

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:25.236
and therefore they are very useful
for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.

00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:27.120
So I've told you quite a lot about

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.336
what conservation drones are,

00:08:29.336 --> 00:08:31.653
how you might operate one of these drones,

00:08:31.653 --> 00:08:33.662
and what a drone could do for you.

00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:35.898
I will now tell you where conservation drones

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.353
are being used around the world.

00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:41.406
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.

00:08:41.406 --> 00:08:43.547
We brought a few of these to Indonesia

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:45.690
for the first few test flights.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.505
Since then, we've been building drones

00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:50.187
for our collaborators from around the world,

00:08:50.187 --> 00:08:52.367
and these include fellow biologists

00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:56.295
and partners from major conservation organizations.

00:08:56.295 --> 00:08:58.585
Perhaps the best and most rewarding part

00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:00.711
about working with these collaborators

00:09:00.711 --> 00:09:02.191
is the feedback they give us

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.834
on how to improve our drones.

00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:06.965
Building drones for us is

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:09.129
a constant work in progress.

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:12.206
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:14.820
their range, their ruggedness,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.498
and the amount of payload they can carry.

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:19.540
We also work with collaborators

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.827
to discover new ways of using these drones.

00:09:22.827 --> 00:09:26.107
For example, camera traps are a common tool

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:30.002
used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.563
hiding in the forests,

00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:33.897
but these are motion-activated cameras,

00:09:33.897 --> 00:09:36.538
so they snap a picture every time an animal

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:38.210
crosses their path.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.762
But the problem with camera traps

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:43.505
is that the researcher has to go back to the forest

00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:46.958
every so often to retrieve those images,

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.610
and that takes a lot of time,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.444
especially if there are dozens

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:53.572
or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:56.383
Now a drone could be designed to perform the task

00:09:56.383 --> 00:09:58.107
much more efficiently.

00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:00.777
This drone, carrying a special sensor,

00:10:00.777 --> 00:10:03.118
could be flown over the forest

00:10:03.118 --> 00:10:05.865
and remotely download these images

00:10:05.865 --> 00:10:10.002
from wi-fi–enabled cameras.

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:12.139
Radio collars are another tool

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:14.387
that's commonly used by biologists.

00:10:14.387 --> 00:10:17.054
Now these collars are put onto animals.

00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:19.855
They transmit a radio signal which allows

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:25.002
the researcher to track the movements
of these animals across the landscape.

00:10:25.002 --> 00:10:27.659
But the traditional way of tracking animals

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:29.881
is pretty ridiculous,

00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:32.825
because it requires the researcher to be walking

00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:36.939
on the ground carrying a huge
and cumbersome radio antenna,

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:39.812
not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:42.780
on our rooftops. Some of us still do.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.045
A drone could be used to do the same job

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.704
much more efficiently.

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:48.410
Why not equip a drone

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.413
with a scanning radio receiver,

00:10:50.413 --> 00:10:52.407
fly that over the forest canopy

00:10:52.407 --> 00:10:53.945
in a certain pattern

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.737
which would allow the user or the operator

00:10:56.737 --> 00:10:59.319
to triangulate the location

00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:02.306
of these radio-collared animals remotely

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:05.279
without having to step foot in the forest.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.782
A third and perhaps most exciting way

00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:09.312
of using these drones

00:11:09.312 --> 00:11:12.262
is to fly them to a really remote,

00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:14.538
never-explored-before rainforest

00:11:14.538 --> 00:11:16.362
somewhere hidden in the tropics,

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:20.295
and parachute down a tiny spy microphone

00:11:20.295 --> 00:11:22.741
that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls

00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:26.063
of mammals, birds, amphibians,

00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:30.340
the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.079
That would give us biologists

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.965
a pretty good idea of what animals

00:11:33.965 --> 00:11:36.515
might be living in those forests.

00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:38.564
And finally, I would like to show you

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:41.665
the latest version of our conservation drone.

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:43.804
The MAJA drone has a wingspan

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.478
of about two meters.

00:11:45.478 --> 00:11:47.428
It weighs only about two kilograms,

00:11:47.428 --> 00:11:49.889
but it can carry half its weight.

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:52.484
It is a fully autonomous system.

00:11:52.484 --> 00:11:54.871
During its mission, it can even transmit

00:11:54.871 --> 00:11:58.834
a live video feed back to a ground station laptop,

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:00.377
which allows the user

00:12:00.377 --> 00:12:03.307
to see what the drone is seeing in real time.

00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:05.729
It carries a variety of sensors,

00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:08.067
and the photo quality of some of these sensors

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:12.277
can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.

00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:15.958
This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.082
which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.

00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:20.997
That is quite sufficient for most

00:12:20.997 --> 00:12:23.996
of our conservation applications.

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:26.066
Now, conservation drones began as

00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:28.257
a crazy idea from two biologists

00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:31.542
who are just deeply passionate
about this technology.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.692
And we believe, strongly believe,

00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:37.039
that drones can and will be a game changer

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:40.073
for conservation research and applications.

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:43.248
We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics

00:12:43.248 --> 00:12:46.769
who thought that we were just
fooling around with toy planes.

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.195
And in a way, they are right.

00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:49.824
I mean, let's be honest,

00:12:49.824 --> 00:12:53.512
drones are the ultimate toys for boys.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:55.918
But at the same time, we've also gotten to know

00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:58.167
many wonderful colleagues and collaborators

00:12:58.167 --> 00:12:59.715
who share our vision

00:12:59.715 --> 00:13:02.571
and see the potential of conservation drones.

00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:06.170
To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.428
and practitioners should make full use

00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:11.962
of every available tool, including drones,

00:13:11.962 --> 00:13:14.603
in our fight to save the last remaining forests

00:13:14.603 --> 00:13:16.390
and wildlife of this planet.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.388
Thank you.

00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:24.110
(Applause)
