00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.717
One of the things I want to establish right from the start

00:00:14.717 --> 00:00:17.747
is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:19.926
I just wanted you to know that.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.335
So I am indeed a neurosurgeon,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:26.262
and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:27.855
and what I'm going to tell you about today

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.173
is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:32.128
being able to go anywhere in the brain

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:34.547
and turning areas of the brain up or down

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:36.759
to help our patients.

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.709
So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:43.261
It's been around for about 7,000 years.

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.986
In Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:50.754
and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:54.665
And they were trying to -- they knew that the brain was involved

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.032
in neurological and psychiatric disease.

00:00:57.032 --> 00:00:59.193
They didn't know exactly what they were doing.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.007
Not much has changed, by the way. (Laughter)

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:03.880
But they thought that,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.883
if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:08.474
it must be because you are possessed

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:10.826
by an evil spirit.

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:12.795
So if you are possessed by an evil spirit

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.615
causing neurologic or psychiatric problems,

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.636
then the way to treat this is, of course,

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:23.319
to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.697
So this was the thinking back then,

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:28.841
and these individuals made these holes.

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:31.824
Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.239
to go through this because, you can tell that

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.690
the holes are made partially and then, I think,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.705
there was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.606
and it was only a partial hole,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:42.922
and we know they survived these procedures.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:44.130
But this was common.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.396
There were some sites where one percent

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:48.121
of all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.315
that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,

00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:55.748
and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.901
Now, in the course of time,

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.121
we've come to realize that

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.379
different parts of the brain do different things.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:03.566
So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.259
to controlling your movement or your vision

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.208
or your memory or your appetite, and so on.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.942
And when things work well, then the nervous system

00:02:11.942 --> 00:02:13.611
works well, and everything functions.

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.858
But once in a while, things don't go so well,

00:02:15.858 --> 00:02:18.400
and there's trouble in these circuits,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.104
and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring

00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:24.283
and causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:26.827
and they're not quite working as they should.

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.964
Now, the manifestation of this

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:31.448
depends on where in the brain these neurons are.

00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:33.870
So when these neurons are in the motor circuit,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.282
you get dysfunction in the movement system,

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:38.448
and you get things like Parkinson's disease.

00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:41.744
When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.028
you get things like depression,

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:47.852
and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:50.373
then you get things like Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:53.096
So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.403
where these disturbances are in the brain,

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:58.440
and we've been able to intervene within these circuits

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.096
in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:04.380
So this is very much like choosing the correct station

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.355
on the radio dial.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:09.004
Once you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.337
in our case whether it be movement or mood,

00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:13.303
we can put the dial there,

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:16.074
and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:18.083
to turn it up or turn it down.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:19.311
So what I'm going to tell you about

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:23.369
is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.837
and turning areas of the brain up and down

00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:27.541
to see if we can help our patients.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.874
And this is accomplished using this kind of device,

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.335
and this is called deep brain stimulation.

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:35.406
So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:39.355
Again, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:41.506
putting an electrode in, and then this electrode

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:43.734
is completely underneath the skin

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.824
down to a pacemaker in the chest,

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:50.352
and with a remote control very much like a television remote control,

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:53.331
we can adjust how much electricity we deliver

00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:55.399
to these areas of the brain.

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.290
We can turn it up or down, on or off.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.945
Now, about a hundred thousand patients in the world

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:02.821
have received deep brain stimulation,

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:03.975
and I'm going to show you some examples

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:06.686
of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.200
disorders of mood and disorders of cognition.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.939
So this looks something like this when it's in the brain.

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.174
You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain

00:04:16.174 --> 00:04:19.357
and resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.

00:04:19.357 --> 00:04:21.817
I tell my friends that no neuron is safe

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:23.999
from a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.565
just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:29.085
Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:30.795
with Parkinson's disease,

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:32.782
and this lady has Parkinson's disease,

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:35.092
and she has these electrodes in her brain,

00:04:35.092 --> 00:04:36.374
and I'm going to show you what she's like

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:39.881
when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:42.214
and then we're going to turn it on.

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.909
So this looks something like this.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.414
The electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.139
(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.764
(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:05:00.556
We're now going to turn it on.

00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:04.994
It's on. Just turned it on.

00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:09.824
And this works like that, instantly.

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.806
And the difference between shaking in this way and not --

00:05:12.806 --> 00:05:17.407
(Applause)

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:21.512
The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior

00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:25.485
of 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.

00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:28.061
So we now know how to find these troublemakers

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.452
and tell them, "Gentlemen, that's enough.

00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:30.786
We want you to stop doing that."

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.008
And we do that with electricity.

00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:35.422
So we use electricity to dictate how they fire,

00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:38.884
and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.

00:05:38.884 --> 00:05:42.328
So in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons.

00:05:42.328 --> 00:05:44.890
We started using this technique in other problems,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.292
and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.460
that we encountered, a case of dystonia.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.965
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children.

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:55.027
It's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,

00:05:55.027 --> 00:05:57.851
and these children get progressively more and more twisting

00:05:57.851 --> 00:05:59.842
until they can't breathe, until they get sores,

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:01.873
urinary infections, and then they die.

00:06:01.873 --> 00:06:05.246
So back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,

00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:08.202
perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:10.421
There are eight children in the family.

00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:13.780
Five of them have dystonia.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.965
So here he is.

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:20.151
This boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:24.546
and then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:27.966
then the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:31.213
then the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,

00:06:31.213 --> 00:06:34.153
within the course of one or two years of the disease onset,

00:06:34.153 --> 00:06:36.473
he could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:39.171
He was crippled, and indeed the natural progression

00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.726
as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,

00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:48.416
progressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.444
So he is one of five kids.

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:54.538
The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:56.494
He did not respond to any drugs.

00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:58.434
We did not know what to do with this boy.

00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:00.550
We did not know what operation to do,

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.744
where to go in the brain,

00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:05.517
but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,

00:07:05.517 --> 00:07:07.522
we reasoned, why don't we try to suppress

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:10.619
the same area in the brain that we suppressed

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:14.274
in Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:16.061
So here he was. We operated on him

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:19.935
hoping that he would get better. We did not know.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:24.062
So here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,

00:07:24.062 --> 00:07:28.115
three months after the procedure, and here he is.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:33.065
(Applause)

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.290
On the basis of this result, this is now a procedure

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.538
that's done throughout the world,

00:07:40.538 --> 00:07:41.833
and there have been hundreds of children

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:46.040
that have been helped with this kind of surgery.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.157
This boy is now in university

00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:50.193
and leads quite a normal life.

00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:52.561
This has been one of the most satisfying cases

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:54.540
that I have ever done in my entire career,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.917
to restore movement and walking to this kind of child.

00:07:57.917 --> 00:08:04.172
(Applause)

00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:07.041
We realized that perhaps we could use this technology

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.213
not only in circuits that control your movement

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:11.165
but also circuits that control other things,

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:12.312
and the next thing that we took on

00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:15.305
was circuits that control your mood.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.381
And we decided to take on depression,

00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:19.640
and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.184
and as you know, there are many treatments for depression,

00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:24.221
with medication and psychotherapy,

00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.283
even electroconvulsive therapy,

00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:27.617
but there are millions of people,

00:08:27.617 --> 00:08:30.409
and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:33.661
that do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.

00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.764
And let's see if we can use this technique

00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:38.003
to help these patients with depression.

00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:39.853
So the first thing we did was, we compared,

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.677
what's different in the brain of someone with depression

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:43.345
and someone who is normal,

00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:46.805
and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.174
and what we noticed is that in patients with depression

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:51.219
compared to normals,

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:52.717
areas of the brain are shut down,

00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:53.982
and those are the areas in blue.

00:08:53.982 --> 00:08:55.602
So here you really have the blues,

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:59.175
and the areas in blue are areas that are involved

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:01.831
in motivation, in drive and decision-making,

00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.326
and indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:07.018
those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.

00:09:07.018 --> 00:09:08.897
The other thing we discovered

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:11.386
was an area that was overactive, area 25,

00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:12.974
seen there in red,

00:09:12.974 --> 00:09:15.631
and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.

00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.504
If I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:20.791
the last time you saw your parent before they died

00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.424
or a friend before they died,

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.630
this area of the brain lights up.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.353
It is the sadness center of the brain.

00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:28.565
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity.

00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:30.743
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.

00:09:30.743 --> 00:09:33.400
The thermostat is set at 100 degrees,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.528
and the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.

00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:39.525
So we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.954
and see if we can turn down the thermostat,

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:43.667
can we turn down the activity,

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.789
and what will be the consequence of that?

00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:48.916
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.

00:09:48.916 --> 00:09:51.403
This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.337
And we placed electrodes in area 25,

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:55.622
and in the top scan you see before the operation,

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:57.908
area 25, the sadness area is red hot,

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:00.302
and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,

00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:02.710
and then, after three months of continuous stimulation,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.725
24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation,

00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:07.499
we have a complete reversal of this.

00:10:07.499 --> 00:10:10.338
We're able to drive down area 25,

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:12.290
down to a more normal level,

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.326
and we're able to turn back online

00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:15.634
the frontal lobes of the brain,

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:17.503
and indeed we're seeing very striking results

00:10:17.503 --> 00:10:20.250
in these patients with severe depression.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.152
So now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,

00:10:23.152 --> 00:10:25.695
and this may become a new procedure,

00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:27.878
if it's safe and we find that it's effective,

00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:31.552
to treat patients with severe depression.

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:34.527
I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation

00:10:34.527 --> 00:10:36.614
to treat the motor system

00:10:36.614 --> 00:10:39.060
in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.445
I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit

00:10:41.445 --> 00:10:43.095
in cases of depression.

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:47.640
Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.736
(Laughter)

00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:52.302
Anybody interested in that?

00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:54.602
(Applause)

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:57.590
Of course we can, right?

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.804
So what we've decided to do is

00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:02.225
we're going to try to turbocharge

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.430
the memory circuits in the brain.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.166
We're going to place electrodes within the circuits

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.842
that regulate your memory and cognitive function

00:11:09.842 --> 00:11:13.112
to see if we can turn up their activity.

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:15.050
Now we're not going to do this in normal people.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.702
We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:22.161
and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease

00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.268
who have cognitive and memory deficits.

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:26.207
As you know, this is the main symptom

00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:28.630
of early onset Alzheimer's disease.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.824
So we've placed electrodes within this circuit

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.819
in an area of the brain called the fornix,

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:35.597
which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,

00:11:35.597 --> 00:11:39.025
with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:42.274
and whether that can, in turn, help these patients

00:11:42.274 --> 00:11:44.583
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:46.901
Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.973
there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.

00:11:50.973 --> 00:11:54.391
The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:56.151
It uses 20 percent of all your --

00:11:56.151 --> 00:11:57.666
even though it only weighs two percent --

00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:00.811
it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.

00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.394
Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,

00:12:03.394 --> 00:12:05.824
and as you go from being normal

00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:08.017
to having mild cognitive impairment,

00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:10.472
which is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,

00:12:10.472 --> 00:12:13.161
then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.

00:12:13.161 --> 00:12:15.456
They shut down. They turn off.

00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:17.738
And indeed, what we see is that these areas in red

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.505
around the outside ribbon of the brain

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.781
are progressively getting more and more blue

00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:24.953
until they shut down completely.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.312
This is analogous to having a power failure

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:29.855
in an area of the brain, a regional power failure.

00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:32.252
So the lights are out in parts of the brain

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.850
in patients with Alzheimer's disease,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.259
and the question is, are the lights out forever,

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.120
or can we turn the lights back on?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.356
Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again?

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.906
So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:48.519
of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:52.030
and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.292
And indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,

00:12:55.292 --> 00:12:58.656
the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:00.864
predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.574
These areas of the brain are shut down.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.249
The lights are out in these areas of the brain.

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.203
We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month

00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:09.594
or a year, and the areas in red

00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:12.901
represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.

00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:15.021
And indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain

00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:18.535
that were not using glucose to use glucose once again.

00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:20.887
So the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,

00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:23.216
the lights are out, but there is someone home,

00:13:23.216 --> 00:13:25.365
and we're able to turn the power back on

00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:27.671
to these areas of the brain, and as we do so,

00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:30.607
we expect that their functions will return.

00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:32.734
So this is now in clinical trials.

00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:34.635
We are going to operate on 50 patients

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:36.613
with early Alzheimer's disease

00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:38.670
to see whether this is safe and effective,

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.649
whether we can improve their neurologic function.

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:49.129
(Applause)

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:52.077
So the message I want to leave you with today is that,

00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.681
indeed, there are several circuits in the brain

00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:58.607
that are malfunctioning across various disease states,

00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:00.815
whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,

00:14:00.815 --> 00:14:03.897
depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.

00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:06.927
We are now learning to understand what are the circuits,

00:14:06.927 --> 00:14:09.129
what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:11.649
the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:13.955
We can now reach those circuits.

00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:16.587
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits.

00:14:16.587 --> 00:14:19.569
We can graduate the activity of those circuits.

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:22.821
We can turn them down if they are overactive,

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.778
if they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,

00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:28.359
or we can turn them up if they are underperforming,

00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:30.752
and in so doing, we think that we may be able to help

00:14:30.752 --> 00:14:33.092
the overall function of the brain.

00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:35.646
The implications of this, of course, is that we may be able

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:37.956
to modify the symptoms of the disease,

00:14:37.956 --> 00:14:39.865
but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence

00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:44.028
that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,

00:14:44.028 --> 00:14:46.480
and this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.719
we not only change the activity but also

00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:50.733
some of the reparative functions of the brain

00:14:50.733 --> 00:14:52.288
can be harvested.

00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:55.335
So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion

00:14:55.335 --> 00:14:57.787
of indications of this technique.

00:14:57.787 --> 00:15:00.566
We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:03.525
One of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,

00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:05.372
it involves multidisciplinary work.

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:08.174
It involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:10.376
of basic scientists, of neurologists,

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:13.128
psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:16.069
of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:18.826
And I think that we will see that

00:15:18.826 --> 00:15:22.262
we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits

00:15:22.262 --> 00:15:24.158
out from the brain as time goes on,

00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:26.060
and the consequence of that, of course, will be

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.332
that we will be able to help many more patients.

00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:29.582
Thank you very much.
