00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
have come back missing at least one full arm.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And they deserve more than that."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and he said, "That's what I want from you."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And it can't be done.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Not in an envelope of a human arm,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
He said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You think it's bad to lose one arm?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I got a day job,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He says to me, "We've done some work around the country.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
found the best of the best.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
got up to 20 some-odd people.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We put this thing together.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
which is unfortunately more in the news these days.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We showed it to a bunch of guys.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
One guy who described himself as being lucky,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But understand what you're looking at

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so that we could put it in any of these people.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
MRIs of whatever is their good arm,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
exact mirror image of their other limb.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This weighs 6.9 pounds.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Going to scratch his nose.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Applause)
