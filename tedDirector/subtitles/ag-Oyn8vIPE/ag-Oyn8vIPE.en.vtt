00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
praise, admiration and thank you,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
and having it be specific and genuine.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And the way I got interested in this was,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
and until about a few years ago,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
that I would want to say thank you to someone,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.330
I would want to praise them,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
I would want to take in their praise of me

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
and I'd just stop it.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And I asked myself, why?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And then my question became,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
am I the only one who does this?

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.330
So, I decided to investigate.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.330
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
But then, they hear from all the family and friends

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.330
but he never told the son.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
who's longing to hear his wife say,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
but won't ask.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
I know a woman who's good at this.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And praise really does have to be genuine,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
but she takes responsibility for that.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
she thanks her children for doing their chores.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.330
Why were other people blocking it?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
I need size six shoes," but I won't say,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
"Would you praise me this way?"

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
I'm telling you where I need your help.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
And I'm treating you, my inner circle,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
like you're the enemy.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Because what can you do with that data?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
You could neglect me.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.330
You could abuse it.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Or you could actually meet my need.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this --

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.330
it's going to make the bike so much better."

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
I get the same bike back,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
I want you to true your wheels:

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
be honest about the praise that you need to hear.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
go ask her, what does she need?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.330
And it's simple.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And why should we care about this?

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.330
We talk about world peace.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And I want to thank all of you in the audience

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
for being great husbands, great mothers,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
friends, daughters, sons.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.330
And maybe somebody's never said that to you,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
but you've done a really, really good job.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
And thank you for being here, just showing up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
and changing the world with your ideas.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Thank you.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.330
(Applause)
