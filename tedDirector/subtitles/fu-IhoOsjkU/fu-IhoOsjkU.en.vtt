00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.330
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ...

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
Well, it's the era of a lot of different things

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
that we're in right now. But one thing for sure:

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
it's the era of change. There's more change going on

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.330
than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
so that you really understand it.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.330
that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
since I was born. When you have a new baby,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
by the time that kid gets out of high school

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
This is unprecedented, and it's big.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.330
versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.330
the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.330
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
Now, the third curve is information technology.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
of information, but it has been pretty good for showing

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
a lot of other things about information technology --

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
This is the size of the earth going through that same --

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
(Laughter)

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.330
-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
There's no need to see the little detailed words on it.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
That first one is humans-versus-nature;

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
we've won, there's no more gain. Human population.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.330
that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.330
they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.330
transported, housed and so on. And the information technology,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
It's just going up through the roof.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
So, that's the stage out of all this. I find,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.330
when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
economically, it's achievable; politically,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
The institutions of the past with all their inertia

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.330
and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
and whatever else we devote ourselves to.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.330
And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
which is putting information and dogma into them,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.330
about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
think broadly or creative. They can be.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
for the things that are important in life

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
or for the survival of civilization; they reward you

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.330
for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
We can't go into that today because there isn't time --

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.330
there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
with more efficiency using less energy, less material.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.330
we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
in this direction in 1976 and 77,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.330
winning the Kremer prize in aviation history,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
followed by the Albatross. And we began

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
making various odd planes and creatures.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
This was the full size of the original creature.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
We did things on land, in the air, on water --

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
whether its land, air or water.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
165 miles carrying a person from France to England

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
into turning it into a commercial product.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.330
With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
which shows a little airplane for surveillance

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
and moving to a giant airplane.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.330
and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.330
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.330
They are powered only by the energy

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
they can extract from the atmosphere --

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.330
(Music)

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
that photovoltaic cells can produce real power

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
and will be part of the world's energy future.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.330
In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
solely on the power of sunbeams,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
and established a basis for the Pathfinder.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
(Music)

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.330
can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
gains that can help us attain a desirable balance

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
between technology and nature. The stakes are high

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
as we speed toward a challenging future.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.330
can and must do more with less -- much less."

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.330
put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:18.330
the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
after it had just flown to 71,530 feet --

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.330
And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
and with wonderful results like that flight.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.330
(Music)

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
There he's the project manager. Anything they do

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.330
is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.330
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
(Music)

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.330
this is starting --

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
while the plane is flying. And it's exploring

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and permits life on earth to be the success that it is --

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.330
probing that is very important. And also we consider it

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.330
2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.330
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
But now let's look at the other end.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.330
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.330
surveillance drone that Keenan has developed

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.330
is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:06.330
the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're --

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.330
all right

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.330
looking out of its camera.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.330
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.330
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.330
and be able to fly the plane better.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.330
MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.330
Here we go.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:08.330
(Applause)

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.330
there it goes.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.330
Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.330
We get to do the classic.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.330
All right.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.330
If this hits you, it will not hurt you.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
(Laughter)

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.330
OK.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:58.330
(Applause)

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.330
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:06.330
(Applause)

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
But now, as they say in infomercials,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
we have something much better for you, which we're working on:

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.330
And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:34.330
will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
with just a little battery in it.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.330
But there's a lot of technology going.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.330
There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
This one doesn't have the video in it,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
but you get a little feel from what it can do.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
OK, here we go.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:04.330
(Laughter)

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.330
MK: Sorry.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.330
OK.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.330
(Applause)

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.330
PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.330
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
(Laughter)

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.330
But you're beginning to see what can be done.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.330
the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.330
Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.330
But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
that are way beyond existing technology,

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
You can do amazing things when you realize

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
but when you get down to the nature's realm,

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
nature has 200 million years of experience.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.330
you don't leave any progeny.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
We should have nothing but success stories from nature,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.330
for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
from its fascinating subjects.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:24.330
In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:30.330
and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.330
The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
and had it say what I wanted.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.330
a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.330
and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.330
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.330
to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.330
And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.330
we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.330
Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.330
Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.330
tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.330
Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.330
and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.330
with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.330
And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.330
with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.330
and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.330
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.330
but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.330
This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.330
And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.330
Things are going on this decade, next decade;

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.330
it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.330
I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.330
not a forecast. That was before --

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.330
I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.330
of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.330
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.330
is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.330
And so where it all goes, I don't know.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.330
The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.330
is an utterly impractical flight vehicle,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:01.330
which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.330
rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.330
MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.330
and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:37.330
The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.330
And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330
But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:49.330
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.330
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:21:00.330
We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:05.330
(Applause)

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.330
And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:15.330
(Laughter)

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:21.330
(Applause)

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.330
Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.330
We can probably get it down,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.330
but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.330
(Laughter)

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.330
-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.330
(Applause)

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.330
just --

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.330
(Applause)

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:43.330
But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.330
there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:52.330
like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.330
there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.330
there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.330
there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.330
on zero-emission vehicles in California.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.330
A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330
probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.330
I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.330
like they're trying to get in education systems.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.330
So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.330
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:26.330
as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.330
that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.330
and puts it all together in things that are --

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.330
that make this conference, I think, more important than any

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.330
that's taken place in this country in this decade.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.330
Thank you. (Applause)
