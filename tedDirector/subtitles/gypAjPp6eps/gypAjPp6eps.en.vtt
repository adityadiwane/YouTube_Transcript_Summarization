00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.256
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.976
and it is my job,
my responsibility, as an astronomer

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.320
to remind people that alien hypotheses
should always be a last resort.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.576
Now, I want to tell you
a story about that.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.176
It involves data from a NASA mission,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.160
ordinary people and one of the most
extraordinary stars in our galaxy.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.400
It began in 2009 with the launch
of NASA's Kepler mission.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.056
Kepler's main scientific objective

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.056
was to find planets
outside of our solar system.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.656
It did this by staring
at a single field in the sky,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.520
this one, with all the tiny boxes.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.896
And in this one field,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.336
it monitored the brightness
of over 150,000 stars

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.776
continuously for four years,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.440
taking a data point every 30 minutes.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.496
It was looking for what
astronomers call a transit.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.536
This is when the planet's orbit
is aligned in our line of sight,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.696
just so that the planet
crosses in front of a star.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.096
And when this happens,
it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.840
which you can see as a dip in this curve.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.016
And so the team at NASA
had developed very sophisticated computers

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.760
to search for transits
in all the Kepler data.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.056
At the same time
of the first data release,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.200
astronomers at Yale
were wondering an interesting thing:

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.600
What if computers missed something?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.720
And so we launched the citizen
science project called Planet Hunters

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.960
to have people look at the same data.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.376
The human brain has an amazing ability
for pattern recognition,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.616
sometimes even better than a computer.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.176
However, there was a lot
of skepticism around this.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.736
My colleague, Debra Fischer,
founder of the Planet Hunters project,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.736
said that people at the time were saying,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.880
"You're crazy. There's no way
that a computer will miss a signal."

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.776
And so it was on, the classic
human versus machine gamble.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.976
And if we found one planet,
we would be thrilled.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.456
When I joined the team four years ago,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.920
we had already found a couple.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.016
And today, with the help
of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.816
we have found dozens,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.096
and we've also found
one of the most mysterious stars

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.320
in our galaxy.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.496
So to understand this,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.720
let me show you what a normal transit
in Kepler data looks like.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.056
On this graph on the left-hand side
you have the amount of light,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.936
and on the bottom is time.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.016
The white line
is light just from the star,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.416
what astronomers call a light curve.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.296
Now, when a planet transits a star,
it blocks out a little bit of this light,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.776
and the depth of this transit
reflects the size of the object itself.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.416
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.576
Planets don't get
much bigger than Jupiter.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.376
Jupiter will make a one percent drop
in a star's brightness.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.576
Earth, on the other hand,
is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.416
and the signal
is barely visible in the data.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.720
So back to our mystery.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.400
A few years ago, Planet Hunters were
sifting through data looking for transits,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.160
and they spotted a mysterious signal
coming from the star KIC 8462852.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.936
The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.818
and they started talking about this
in the discussion forums.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.416
They said and object like Jupiter

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.336
would make a drop like this
in the star's light,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.696
but they were also saying it was giant.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.936
You see, transits normally
only last for a few hours,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.080
and this one lasted for almost a week.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.416
They were also saying
that it looks asymmetric,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.696
meaning that instead of the clean,
U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.216
it had this strange slope
that you can see on the left side.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.576
This seemed to indicate

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.976
that whatever was getting in the way
and blocking the starlight

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.920
was not circular like a planet.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.136
There are few more dips that happened,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520
but for a couple of years,
it was pretty quiet.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.560
And then in March of 2011, we see this.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.216
The star's light drops
by a whole 15 percent,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.416
and this is huge compared to a planet,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440
which would only make a one percent drop.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.016
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.056
It also is asymmetric,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.736
having a gradual dimming
that lasts almost a week,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.920
and then it snaps right back up to normal
in just a matter of days.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.176
And again, after this, not much happens

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.896
until February of 2013.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.536
Things start to get really crazy.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.056
There is a huge complex of dips
in the light curve that appear,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.216
and they last for like a hundred days,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.480
all the way up
into the Kepler mission's end.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.256
These dips have variable shapes.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.496
Some are very sharp, and some are broad,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.776
and they also have variable durations.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.960
Some last just for a day or two,
and some for more than a week.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.456
And there's also up and down trends
within some of these dips,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.160
almost like several independent events
were superimposed on top of each other.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.136
And at this time, this star drops
in its brightness over 20 percent.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.303
This means that whatever
is blocking its light

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:45.767
has an area of over 1,000 times
the area of our planet Earth.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.440
This is truly remarkable.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.736
And so the citizen scientists,
when they saw this,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.456
they notified the science team
that they found something weird enough

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.920
that it might be worth following up.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.736
And so when the science team looked at it,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.141
we're like, "Yeah, there's probably
just something wrong with the data."

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.696
But we looked really, really, really hard,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.120
and the data were good.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.776
And so what was happening
had to be astrophysical,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.456
meaning that something in space
was getting in the way

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.880
and blocking starlight.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.456
And so at this point,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.056
we set out to learn
everything we could about the star

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.000
to see if we could find any clues
to what was going on.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.896
And the citizen scientists
who helped us in this discovery,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.456
they joined along for the ride

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.560
watching science in action firsthand.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.456
First, somebody said, you know,
what if this star was very young

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.080
and it still had the cloud of material
it was born from surrounding it.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.456
And then somebody else said,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.256
well, what if the star
had already formed planets,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.496
and two of these planets had collided,

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.640
similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.976
Well, both of these theories
could explain part of the data,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.416
but the difficulties were that the star
showed no signs of being young,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.376
and there was no glow
from any of the material

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.496
that was heated up by the star's light,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.376
and you would expect this
if the star was young

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.960
or if there was a collision
and a lot of dust was produced.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.416
And so somebody else said,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.416
well, how about a huge swarm of comets

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.096
that are passing by this star
in a very elliptical orbit?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.520
Well, it ends up that this is actually
consistent with our observations.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.256
But I agree, it does feel
a little contrived.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.576
You see, it would take hundreds of comets

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.240
to reproduce what we're observing.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.776
And these are only the comets

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.416
that happen to pass
between us and the star.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.896
And so in reality, we're talking
thousands to tens of thousands of comets.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.376
But of all the bad ideas we had,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.536
this one was the best.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.496
And so we went ahead
and published our findings.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.736
Now, let me tell you, this was one
of the hardest papers I ever wrote.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.096
Scientists are meant to publish results,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.280
and this situation was far from that.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.096
And so we decided
to give it a catchy title,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.296
and we called it: "Where's The Flux?"

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.400
I will let you work out the acronym.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.880
(Laughter)

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.536
So this isn't the end of the story.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.736
Around the same time
I was writing this paper,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.896
I met with a colleague
of mine, Jason Wright,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.136
and he was also writing a paper
on Kepler data.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.336
And he was saying that with Kepler's
extreme precision,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.216
it could actually detect
alien megastructures around stars,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.440
but it didn't.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.480
And then I showed him this weird data
that our citizen scientists had found,

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:48.775
and he said to me,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.576
"Aw crap, Tabby.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.559
Now I have to rewrite my paper."

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.640
So yes, the natural
explanations were weak,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.056
and we were curious now.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.256
So we had to find a way
to rule out aliens.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.136
So together, we convinced
a colleague of ours

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.416
who works on SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.360
that this would be
an extraordinary target to pursue.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.856
We wrote a proposal to observe the star

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.056
with the world's largest radio telescope
at the Green Bank Observatory.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.456
A couple months later,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.720
news of this proposal
got leaked to the press

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.216
and now there are thousands of articles,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.376
over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.240
And if you search Google Images,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.120
this is what you'll find.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.096
Now, you may be wondering,
OK, Tabby, well,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.976
how do aliens actually explain
this light curve?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.296
OK, well, imagine a civilization
that's much more advanced than our own.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.640
In this hypothetical circumstance,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.336
this civilization would have exhausted
the energy supply of their home planet,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.536
so where could they get more energy?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.360
Well, they have a host star
just like we have a sun,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.296
and so if they were able
to capture more energy from this star,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.280
then that would solve their energy needs.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.216
So they would go
and build huge structures.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.016
These giant megastructures,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.760
like ginormous solar panels,
are called Dyson spheres.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.736
This image above

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.936
are lots of artists' impressions
of Dyson spheres.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.976
It's really hard to provide perspective
on the vastness of these things,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.816
but you can think of it this way.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.880
The Earth-Moon distance
is a quarter of a million miles.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.936
The simplest element
on one of these structures

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.400
is 100 times that size.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.720
They're enormous.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.496
And now imagine one of these structures
in motion around a star.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.616
You can see how it would produce
anomalies in the data

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.856
such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.856
But it remains that even
alien megastructures

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.296
cannot defy the laws of physics.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.760
You see, anything that uses
a lot of energy

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.560
is going to produce heat,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.816
and we don't observe this.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.536
But it could be something as simple

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.016
as they're just reradiating it away
in another direction,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.240
just not at Earth.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.440
Another idea that's one
of my personal favorites

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.096
is that we had just witnessed
an interplanetary space battle

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.120
and the catastrophic
destruction of a planet.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.776
Now, I admit that this
would produce a lot of dust

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.696
that we don't observe.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.056
But if we're already invoking aliens
in this explanation,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.776
then who is to say they didn't
efficiently clean up all this mess

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.336
for recycling purposes?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.376
(Laughter)

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.360
You can see how this quickly
captures your imagination.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.016
Well, there you have it.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.256
We're in a situation that could unfold

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.696
to be a natural phenomenon
we don't understand

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.280
or an alien technology
we don't understand.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.840
Personally, as a scientist,
my money is on the natural explanation.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.360
But don't get me wrong, I do think
it would be awesome to find aliens.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.320
Either way, there is something new
and really interesting to discover.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.896
So what happens next?

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.576
We need to continue to observe this star

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.016
to learn more about what's happening.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.616
But professional astronomers, like me,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.456
we have limited resources
for this kind of thing,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.400
and Kepler is on to a different mission.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.616
And I'm happy to say that once again,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.760
citizen scientists have come in
and saved the day.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.336
You see, this time,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.240
amateur astronomers
with their backyard telescopes

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.096
stepped up immediately
and started observing this star nightly

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.616
at their own facilities,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.440
and I am so excited to see what they find.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.696
What's amazing to me is that this star
would have never been found by computers

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.360
because we just weren't looking
for something like this.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.656
And what's more exciting

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.320
is that there's more data to come.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.176
There are new missions that are coming up

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.880
that are observing millions more stars

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.240
all over the sky.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.800
And just think: What will it mean
when we find another star like this?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.600
And what will it mean
if we don't find another star like this?

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.496
Thank you.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:45.441
(Applause)
