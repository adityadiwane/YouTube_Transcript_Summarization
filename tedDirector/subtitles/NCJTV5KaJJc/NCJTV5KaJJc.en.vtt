00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.873
So when I do my job, people hate me.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:19.315
In fact, the better I do my job,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.666
the more people hate me.

00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:23.071
And no, I'm not a meter maid,

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:24.891
and I'm not an undertaker.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.051
I am a progressive, lesbian
talking head on Fox News.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:31.138
(Applause)

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:33.654
So y'all heard that, right?
Just to make sure, right?

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.757
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:38.595
I am going to tell you how I do it,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.747
and the most important thing I've learned.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.247
So I go on television.

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:46.639
I debate people who literally want
to obliterate everything I believe in --

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:50.584
in some cases, who don't want
me and people like me to even exist.

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:53.735
It's sort of like Thanksgiving
with your conservative uncle

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.338
on steroids,

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:58.908
with a live television
audience of millions.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.004
It's totally almost just like that.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:03.362
And that's just on air.

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:05.646
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.

00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.631
Last week alone, I got 238
pieces of nasty email

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.591
and more hate tweets
than I can even count.

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.869
I was called an idiot,
a traitor, a scourge,

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:19.595
a cunt and an ugly man,

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:21.242
and that was just in one email.

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:24.131
(Laughter)

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:26.893
So what have I realized,

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:29.549
being on the receiving end
of all this ugliness?

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.373
Well, my biggest takeaway

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:35.381
is that for decades, we've been focused
on political correctness,

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:39.413
but what matters more
is emotional correctness.

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:41.564
Let me give you a small example.

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.548
I don't care if you call me a dyke.
I really don't.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.045
I care about two things.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.612
One, I care that you spell it right.

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:53.681
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:57.104
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.

00:01:57.358 --> 00:01:59.602
You'd totally be surprised.

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:03.493
And second, I don't care about the word,
I care about how you use it.

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:05.842
Are you being friendly?
Are you just being naive?

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.651
Or do you really want
to hurt me personally?

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:14.278
Emotional correctness
is the tone, the feeling,

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:16.367
how we say what we say,

00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:19.097
the respect and compassion
we show one another.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.256
And what I've realized
is that political persuasion

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:26.129
doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.851
Political persuasion begins
with being emotionally correct.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.216
So when I first went
to go work at Fox News,

00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.438
true confession,

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.359
I expected there to be marks in the carpet

00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:39.295
from all the knuckle-dragging.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.605
That, by the way, in case you're paying
attention, is not emotionally correct.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.661
But liberals on my side,

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.563
we can be self-righteous,
we can be condescending,

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:53.262
we can be dismissive of anyone
who doesn't agree with us.

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:56.050
In other words, we can
be politically right

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.349
but emotionally wrong.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:03.865
And incidentally, that means that
people don't like us. Right?

00:03:05.087 --> 00:03:06.318
Now here's the kicker.

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:09.072
Conservatives are really nice.

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.068
I mean, not all of them,

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:12.952
and not the ones who send me hate mail,

00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:14.364
but you would be surprised.

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:17.798
Sean Hannity is one of
the sweetest guys I've ever met.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.790
He spends his free time
trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.068
and I know that if I ever had a problem,

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:27.179
he would do anything he could to help.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:32.697
Now, I think Sean Hannity
is 99 percent politically wrong,

00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:36.253
but his emotional correctness
is strikingly impressive.

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.227
And that's why people listen to him.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.624
Because you can't get
anyone to agree with you

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:42.957
if they don't even listen to you first.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.513
We spend so much time
talking past each other

00:03:46.828 --> 00:03:49.513
and not enough time talking
through our disagreements.

00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.307
And if we can start to find
compassion for one another,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.458
then we have a shot
at building common ground.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.982
It actually sounds really hokey
to say it standing up here,

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.268
but when you try to put it in practice,

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:04.887
it's really powerful.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.895
So someone who says they hate immigrants,

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.609
I try to imagine how scared they must be

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:13.734
that their community is changing
from what they've always known.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.964
Or someone who says they
don't like teachers' unions,

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:21.006
I bet they're really devastated to see
their kid's school going into the gutter,

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.181
and they're just looking
for someone to blame.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.807
Our challenge is to find
the compassion for others

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.902
that we want them to have for us.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.942
That is emotional correctness.

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:34.982
I'm not saying it's easy.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:38.316
An average of, like, 5.6 times per day

00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:41.158
I have to stop myself from responding
to all of my hate mail

00:04:41.183 --> 00:04:43.499
with a flurry of vile profanities.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.147
This whole finding compassion
and common ground with your enemies thing

00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:53.250
is kind of like a political-spiritual
practice for me,

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.972
and I ain't the Dalai Lama.

00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:01.309
I'm not perfect,
but what I am is optimistic.

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.396
Because I don't just get hate mail.

00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:07.452
I get a lot of really nice
letters, lots of them.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.127
And one of my all-time favorites begins:

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.124
"I am not a big fan
of your political leanings

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:15.151
or your sometimes tortured logic,

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.960
(Laughter)

00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:21.150
but I'm a big fan of you as a person."

00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:25.230
Now this guy doesn't
agree with me -- yet.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.832
(Laughter)

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.376
But he's listening --

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.782
not because of what I said,
but because of how I said it.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:38.726
And somehow, even though we've never met,
we've managed to form a connection.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.020
That's emotional correctness,

00:05:41.313 --> 00:05:43.974
and that's how we start the conversations

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:45.718
that really lead to change.

00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:47.115
Thank you.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.968
(Applause)
