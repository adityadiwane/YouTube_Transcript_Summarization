00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Why grow homes? Because we can.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And there's a cause for that, all right.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
So what's a technology that will allow us

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to make ginormous houses?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And we do something different

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
than what we did in the past;

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
We use CNC to make scaffolding

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
into a specific geometry

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
It is the landscape, right?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and it's great because they suck carbon.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
They're perfect.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Imagine pre-growing a village --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
it takes about seven to 10 years --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and everything is green.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So not only do we do the veggie house,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
to put in a molecular cell biology lab

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and tissue engineering

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and start thinking about what the future would be

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
if architecture and biology became one.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And what we do is we grow

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
extracellular matrix from pigs.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We use a modified inkjet printer,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and we print geometry.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
handbags, etc.,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
where no sentient creature is harmed.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So our theory is that eventually

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
we should be doing this with homes.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So here is a typical stud wall,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
an architectural construction,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and this is a section

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
of our proposal for a meat house,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
cilia for dealing with wind loads

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
(Laughter)

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And we know it's incredibly ugly.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
but we kind of chose this shape.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
We had a big show in Prague,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
so religion can confront the house of meat.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Applause)
