00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.600
There's something about caves --

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.840
a shadowy opening in a limestone
cliff that draws you in.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.456
As you pass through the portal
between light and dark,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.015
you enter a subterranean world --

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.720
a place of perpetual gloom,
of earthy smells, of hushed silence.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.136
Long ago in Europe,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.616
ancient people also entered
these underground worlds.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.056
As witness to their passage,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.735
they left behind mysterious
engravings and paintings,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:51.320
like this panel of humans, triangles
and zigzags from Ojo GuareÃ±a in Spain.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.160
You now walk the same path
as these early artists.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.816
And in this surreal, otherworldly place,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.736
it's almost possible to imagine

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.296
that you hear the muffled footfall
of skin boots on soft earth,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.480
or that you see the flickering of a torch
around the next bend.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.976
When I'm in a cave,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.096
I often find myself wondering
what drove these people to go so deep

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.816
to brave dangerous and narrow
passageways to leave their mark?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.056
In this video clip,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.456
that was shot half a kilometer,
or about a third of a mile, underground,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.616
in the cave of Cudon in Spain,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.096
we found a series
of red paintings on a ceiling

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.056
in a previously unexplored
section of the cave.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.736
As we crawled forward, military-style,
with the ceiling getting ever lower,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.976
we finally got to a point
where the ceiling was so low

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.256
that my husband
and project photographer, Dylan,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.416
could no longer achieve focus
on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.096
So while he filmed me,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.416
I kept following the trail of red paint
with a single light

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.760
and a point-and-shoot camera
that we kept for that type of occasion.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.061
Half a kilometer underground.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.816
Seriously.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.840
What was somebody doing down there
with a torch or a stone lamp?

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:06.056
(Laughter)

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.976
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.216
But you know,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.056
this is the kind of question that
I'm trying to answer with my research.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.760
I study some of the oldest
art in the world.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.856
It was created by these
early artists in Europe,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.960
between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.696
And the thing is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.216
that I'm not just studying it
because it's beautiful,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.717
though some of it certainly is.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.496
But what I'm interested in
is the development of the modern mind,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.456
of the evolution of creativity,
of imagination, of abstract thought,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600
about what it means to be human.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.296
While all species communicate
in one way or another,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.896
only we humans have really
taken it to another level.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.496
Our desire and ability
to share and collaborate

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.176
has been a huge part of our success story.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.016
Our modern world is based on a global
network of information exchange

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.056
made possible, in large part,
by our ability to communicate --

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.080
in particular, using graphic
or written forms of communication.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.776
The thing is, though,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.336
that we've been building
on the mental achievements

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.416
of those that came before us for so long

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.840
that it's easy to forget that certain
abilities haven't already existed.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.136
It's one of the things
I find most fascinating

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.736
about studying our deep history.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.856
Those people didn't have the shoulders
of any giants to stand on.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.336
They were the original shoulders.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.256
And while a surprising number
of important inventions

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.176
come out of that distant time,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.880
what I want to talk to you about today
is the invention of graphic communication.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.856
There are three
main types of communication,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.256
spoken, gestural --
so things like sign language --

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.576
and graphic communication.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.256
Spoken and gestural are
by their very nature ephemeral.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.216
It requires close contact
for a message to be sent and received.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.176
And after the moment
of transmission, it's gone forever.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.176
Graphic communication, on the other hand,
decouples that relationship.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.176
And with its invention,
it became possible for the first time

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.056
for a message to be
transmitted and preserved

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.776
beyond a single moment in place and time.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.576
Europe is one of the first places

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.296
that we start to see graphic marks
regularly appearing

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.560
in caves, rock shelters
and even a few surviving open-air sites.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.776
But this is not the Europe we know today.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.776
This was a world dominated
by towering ice sheets,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.776
three to four kilometers high,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.056
with sweeping grass plains
and frozen tundra.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
This was the Ice Age.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.376
Over the last century,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.696
more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites
have been found across the continent,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.096
decorated with animals, abstract shapes
and even the occasional human

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.736
like these engraved figures
from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.816
They provide us with a rare glimpse

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.920
into the creative world and imagination
of these early artists.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.216
Since their discovery,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.640
it's been the animals that have received
the majority of the study

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.760
like this black horse
from Cullalvera in Spain,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.680
or this unusual purple bison
from La Pasiega.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.256
But for me, it was the abstract shapes,
what we call geometric signs,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.880
that drew me to study the art.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.536
The funny this is that at most sites

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.056
the geometric signs far outnumber
the animal and human images.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.256
But when I started on this back in 2007,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.256
there wasn't even a definitive list
of how many shapes there were,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.616
nor was there a strong sense

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.520
of whether the same ones
appeared across space or time.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.216
Before I could even
get started on my questions,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.336
my first step was to compile a database

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.256
of all known geometric signs
from all of the rock art sites.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.856
The problem was that while they were
well documented at some sites,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.176
usually the ones
with the very nice animals,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.856
there was also a large number of them
where it was very vague --

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.136
there wasn't a lot
of description or detail.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.496
Some of them hadn't been visited
in half a century or more.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.936
These were the ones
that I targeted for my field work.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.816
Over the course of two years,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.056
my faithful husband Dylan and I
each spent over 300 hours underground,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.056
hiking, crawling and wriggling
around 52 sites

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.016
in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.896
And it was totally worth it.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.656
We found new, undocumented geometric signs
at 75 percent of the sites we visited.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.496
This is the level of accuracy
I knew I was going to need

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.696
if I wanted to start answering
those larger questions.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.296
So let's get to those answers.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.936
Barring a handful of outliers,
there are only 32 geometric signs.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.776
Only 32 signs

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.280
across a 30,000-year time span
and the entire continent of Europe.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.296
That is a very small number.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.776
Now, if these were random
doodles or decorations,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.216
we would expect to see
a lot more variation,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.656
but instead what we find
are the same signs

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.120
repeating across both space and time.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.816
Some signs start out strong,
before losing popularity and vanishing,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.176
while other signs are later inventions.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.816
But 65 percent of those signs stayed
in use during that entire time period --

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.136
things like lines, rectangles
triangles, ovals and circles

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.303
like we see here
from the end of the Ice Age,

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:31.256
at a 10,000-year-old site
high in the Pyrenees Mountains.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.496
And while certain signs
span thousands of kilometers,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.496
other signs had much more
restricted distribution patterns,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.936
with some being limited
to a single territory,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.136
like we see here
with these divided rectangles

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.376
that are only found in northern Spain,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.456
and which some researchers have speculated

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.800
could be some sort
of family or clan signs.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.256
On a side note,

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.696
there is surprising degree
of similarity in the earliest rock art

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.296
found all the way from France and Spain
to Indonesia and Australia.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.616
With many of the same signs
appearing in such far-flung places,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.616
especially in that 30,000
to 40,000-year range,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.496
it's starting to seem increasingly likely

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.376
that this invention actually traces back
to a common point of origin in Africa.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.016
But that I'm afraid,
is a subject for a future talk.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.856
So back to the matter at hand.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.856
There could be no doubt that these signs
were meaningful to their creators,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.696
like these 25,000-year-old
bas-relief sculptures

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.336
from La Roque de Venasque in France.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.760
We might not know what they meant,
but the people of the time certainly did.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.816
The repetition of the same signs,
for so long, and at so many sites

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.320
tells us that the artists
were making intentional choices.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.176
If we're talking about geometric shapes,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.936
with specific, culturally recognized,
agreed-upon meanings,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.616
than we could very well be looking

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.176
at one of the oldest systems
of graphic communication in the world.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.096
I'm not talking about writing yet.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.456
There's just not enough
characters at this point

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.336
to have represented all of the words
in the spoken language,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.176
something which is a requirement
for a full writing system.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.576
Nor do we see the signs
repeating regularly enough

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.256
to suggest that they were
some sort of alphabet.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.096
But what we do have
are some intriguing one-offs,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.696
like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,
known as "The Inscription,"

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.256
with its symmetrical markings on the left,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.496
possible stylized representations
of hands in the middle,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.840
and what looks a bit
like a bracket on the right.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.936
The oldest systems of graphic
communication in the world --

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.896
Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,
the earliest Chinese script,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.496
all emerged between 4,000
and 5,000 years ago,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.656
with each coming into existence
from an earlier protosystem

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.216
made up of counting marks
and pictographic representations,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.616
where the meaning
and the image were the same.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.856
So a picture of a bird would really
have represented that animal.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.616
It's only later that we start to see
these pictographs become more stylized,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.976
until they almost become unrecognizable

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.016
and that we also start to see
more symbols being invented

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.936
to represent all those other
missing words in language --

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080
things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.696
So knowing all this,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.576
it seems highly unlikely that
the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.296
were truly abstract written characters.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.536
Instead, what's much more likely

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.536
is that these early artists
were also making counting marks,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.576
maybe like this row of lines
from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.216
as well as creating
stylized representations

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.736
of things from the world around them.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.376
Could some of the signs
be weaponry or housing?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.536
Or what about celestial objects
like star constellations?

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.176
Or maybe even rivers, mountains,
trees -- landscape features,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.576
possibly like this black penniform
surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.176
from the site of El Castillo in Spain.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.496
The term penniform
means "feather-shaped" in Latin,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.360
but could this actually be
a depiction of a plant or a tree?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.696
Some researchers have begun
to ask these questions

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.616
about certain signs at specific sites,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.536
but I believe the time has come
to revisit this category as a whole.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.296
The irony in all of this, of course,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.616
is that having just carefully classified
all of the signs into a single category,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.136
I have a feeling that my next step
will involve breaking it back apart

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.416
as different types of imagery
are identified and separated off.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.656
Now don't get me wrong,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.296
the later creation
of fully developed writing

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.936
was an impressive feat in its own right.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.416
But it's important to remember

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.736
that those early writing systems
didn't come out of a vacuum.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.736
And that even 5,000 years ago,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.096
people were already building
on something much older,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.856
with its origins stretching back
tens of thousands of years --

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.976
to the geometric signs
of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.296
to that point, deep
in our collective history,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.376
when someone first came up with the idea
of making a graphic mark,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.336
and forever changed the nature
of how we communicate.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.576
Thank you.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.040
