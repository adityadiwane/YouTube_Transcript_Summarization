00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
So often, we look at dollar terms --

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
income as only one variable.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Because really, it's a condition about choice,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and the lack of freedom.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
the understanding that I have.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
in the Mathare Valley slums.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
It's about three miles out of Nairobi,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
where over half a million people

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
live crammed in these little tin shacks,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
generation after generation, renting them,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
often eight or 10 people to a room.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
a hard place to grow up.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
it was literally impossible not to step in the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
But at the same time it was also

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
impossible not to see the human vitality,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
I met this woman, Mama Rose,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
where she lives with her seven children.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Four sleep in one twin bed,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
It was also the day after the inauguration,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And I would see kids on the street corners,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And it was here that I met Jane.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
and I asked her to tell me her story.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
My first dream was to be a doctor,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and the second was to marry a good man

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
who would stay with me and my family,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
because my mother was a single mom,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
or sometimes with nothing.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
and the embarrassment of it all."

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
In 2001, her life changed.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160
She started tailoring.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And that turned into what she does now,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Some of them might be ones you gave.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
all along the economic spectrum.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
and also the jewelry that she makes,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
And so she can't move out.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
She lives with all of that insecurity,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
in which she would live.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Jamii Bora understands that and understands

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
that when we're talking about poverty,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
loans and investments that will go the long term with them,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
they built a low-cost housing development,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
about an hour outside Nairobi central.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
And they designed it from the perspective of

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
customers like Jane herself,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
insisting on responsibility and accountability.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
among the first 200 families to move into this development.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
When I asked her if she feared anything,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
she said, "What would I fear

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
that I haven't confronted already?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.160
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
And she said, "What would I miss?

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
my bags would be packed."

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And she said, "Well, you know,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
but what I really wanted was a family

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
but what I really wanted to be was somebody

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
who served and healed and cured.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
But maybe me, I give out something better

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
because I give them hope."

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
And in the middle of this economic crisis,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
where so many of us are inclined to pull in

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
with fear, I think we're well suited to

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
take a cue from Jane and reach out,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Because when systems are broken,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
like the ones that we're seeing around the world,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
It's an opportunity to truly build a world

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
where we can extend services and products

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
to all human beings, so that they can

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
make decisions and choices for themselves.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
We owe it to the Janes of the world.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
Thank you.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
(Applause)
