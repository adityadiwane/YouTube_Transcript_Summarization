00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.483
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:19.634
I present to you the human genome.

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:23.537
(Applause)

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:27.494
Chromosome one -- top left,
bottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:30.246
Women have two copies
of that big X chromosome;

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.435
men have the X and, of course,
that small copy of the Y.

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:37.150
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny
little thing that makes you different.

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.166
So if you zoom in on this genome,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.808
then what you see, of course,
is this double-helix structure --

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:46.966
the code of life spelled out
with these four biochemical letters,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.236
or we call them bases: A, C, G and T.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.832
How many are there
in the human genome? Three billion.

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.036
Is that a big number?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.279
Well, everybody
can throw around big numbers.

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:57.403
But in fact, if I were to place one base

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:01.190
on each pixel of this
1280x800-resolution screen,

00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:04.493
we would need 3,000 screens
to take a look at the genome.

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:05.725
So it's really quite big.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.644
And perhaps because of its size,

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:10.519
a group of people -- all,
by the way, with Y chromosomes --

00:01:10.543 --> 00:01:12.553
decided they would want to sequence it.

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:14.592
(Laughter)

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.873
And so 15 years, actually,
and about four billion dollars later,

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:19.772
the genome was sequenced and published.

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:23.116
In 2003, the final version was published,
and they keep working on it.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.129
That was all done on a machine like this.

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:28.470
It costs about a dollar for each base --
a very slow way of doing it.

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:30.089
Well, folks, I'm here to tell you

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:32.204
that the world has completely changed,

00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:34.038
and none of you know about it.

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:36.751
So now what we do is take a genome,

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:38.314
we make maybe 50 copies of it,

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:41.358
we cut all those copies up
into little 50-base reads,

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.723
and then we sequence them,
massively parallel.

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:46.834
Then we bring that into software
and reassemble it,

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:48.428
and tell you what the story is.

00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:50.767
So to give you a picture
of what this looks like,

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.274
the Human Genome Project:
3 gigabases, right?

00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:57.950
One run on one of these modern machines:
200 gigabases in a week.

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:00.487
And that 200 is going
to change to 600 this summer,

00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.653
and there's no sign of this pace slowing.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.654
The price of a base, to sequence a base,

00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:09.431
has fallen 100 million times.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:13.231
That's the equivalent of you filling up
your car with gas in 1998,

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:14.484
waiting until 2011,

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:16.921
and now you can drive
to Jupiter and back twice.

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:21.236
(Laughter)

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.236
World population,

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.277
PC placements,

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.235
the archive of all of medical literature,

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:29.957
Moore's law,

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.308
the old way of sequencing,

00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:34.089
and here's all the new stuff.

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:35.454
Guys, this is a long scale;

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.236
you don't typically see
lines that go up like that.

00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:42.160
So the worldwide capacity
to sequence human genomes

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:45.353
is something like 50,000 to 100,000
human genomes this year.

00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:48.080
We know this based on the machines
that are being placed.

00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:50.621
This is expected to double,
triple or maybe quadruple

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.855
year over year for the foreseeable future.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.864
In fact, there's one lab in particular

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.824
that represents 20 percent
of all that capacity:

00:02:57.848 --> 00:03:00.236
It's called the Beijing
Genomics Institute.

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:04.371
The Chinese are absolutely winning
this race to the new Moon, by the way.

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.133
What does this mean for medicine?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.444
So a woman, age 37,

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:12.682
presents with stage 2 estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer.

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:15.873
She is treated with surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation.

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:17.081
She goes home.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:18.256
Two years later,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.454
she comes back with stage 3C
ovarian cancer, unfortunately;

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:23.915
treated again with surgery
and chemotherapy.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.193
She comes back three years later at age 42

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:28.574
with more ovarian cancer,
more chemotherapy.

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.067
Six months later,

00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:33.915
she comes back
with acute myeloid leukemia.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.825
She goes into respiratory failure
and dies eight days later.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.207
So first: the way in which
this woman was treated,

00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:43.674
in as little as 10 years,
will look like bloodletting.

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:46.523
And it's because of people
like my colleague, Rick Wilson,

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:48.886
at the Genome Institute
at Washington University,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.369
who decided to take a look
at this woman postmortem.

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:53.876
And he took skin cells, healthy skin

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.838
and cancerous bone marrow,

00:03:55.862 --> 00:03:58.148
and sequenced the whole
genomes of both of them

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.236
in a couple of weeks, no big deal.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.461
Then he compared those two
genomes in software,

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.310
and what he found, among other things,

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:08.947
was a deletion -- a 2,000-base deletion
across three billion bases

00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:11.130
in a particular gene called TP53.

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:13.566
If you have this deleterious
mutation in this gene,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.312
you're 90 percent likely
to get cancer in your life.

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:18.560
So unfortunately,
this doesn't help this woman,

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.236
but it does have severe --
profound, if you will --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.450
implications to her family.

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:25.944
I mean, if they have the same mutation,

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.513
and they get this genetic test
and they understand it,

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:31.418
then they can get regular screens
and can catch cancer early,

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:33.762
and potentially live
a significantly longer life.

00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:35.716
Let me introduce you to the Beery twins,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.072
diagnosed with cerebral palsy
at the age of two.

00:04:38.096 --> 00:04:40.644
Their mom is a very brave woman
who didn't believe it;

00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:42.271
the symptoms weren't matching up.

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:45.303
And through some heroic efforts
and a lot of Internet searching,

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.498
she was able to convince
the medical community

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:49.418
that, in fact, they had something else.

00:04:49.442 --> 00:04:51.608
They had dopa-responsive dystonia.

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:53.611
And so they were given L-Dopa,

00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:55.952
and their symptoms did improve,

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:57.819
but they weren't totally asymptomatic.

00:04:57.843 --> 00:04:59.310
Significant problems remained.

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:02.503
Turns out the gentleman in this picture
is a guy named Joe Beery,

00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:04.170
who was lucky enough to be the CIO

00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:06.315
of a company called Life Technologies.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:07.681
They're one of two companies

00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:10.855
that makes these massive
whole-genome sequencing tools.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.892
And so he got his kids sequenced.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:16.994
What they found was a series of mutations
in a gene called SPR,

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:20.415
which is responsible for producing
serotonin, among other things.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.928
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave
these kids a serotonin precursor drug,

00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:25.674
and they're effectively normal now.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:28.989
Guys, this would never have happened
without whole-genome sequencing.

00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:31.853
At the time -- this was
a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.

00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:33.704
Today it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,

00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:35.757
the year after, $100, give or take a year.

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:37.281
That's how fast this is moving.

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.162
So here's little Nick --

00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:40.902
likes Batman and squirt guns.

00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:44.621
And it turns out Nick
shows up at the children's hospital

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.907
with this distended belly,
like a famine victim.

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:49.767
And it's not that he's not eating;
it's that when he eats,

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:53.202
his intestine basically opens up
and feces spill out into his gut.

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:54.861
So a hundred surgeries later,

00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:58.560
he looks at his mom and says,
"Mom, please pray for me.

00:05:58.584 --> 00:05:59.987
I'm in so much pain."

00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:03.523
His pediatrician happens to have
a background in clinical genetics

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:05.236
and he has no idea what's going on,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.803
but he says, "Let's get
this kid's genome sequenced."

00:06:07.827 --> 00:06:09.967
And what they find
is a single-point mutation

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:12.840
in a gene responsible for controlling
programmed cell death.

00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:15.942
So the theory is that he's having
some immunological reaction

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.381
to what's going on --
to the food, essentially.

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:21.775
And that's a natural reaction,
which causes some programmed cell death,

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:24.069
but the gene that regulates
that down is broken.

00:06:24.093 --> 00:06:26.511
And so this informs,
among other things, of course,

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:29.506
a treatment for bone marrow transplant,
which he undertakes.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.550
And after nine months
of grueling recovery,

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:33.479
he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.

00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:34.600
(Laughter)

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:38.723
The prospect of using the genome
as a universal diagnostic

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:40.287
is upon us today.

00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:43.001
Today. It's here.

00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:44.517
And what it means for all of us

00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:47.828
is that everybody in this room
could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,

00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:49.519
just because of this one thing.

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:51.606
Which is a fantastic story,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.508
unless you think about
humanity's footprint on the planet,

00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.007
and our ability to keep up
food production.

00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:58.603
So it turns out

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:02.568
that the very same technology
is also being used to grow new lines

00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:05.721
of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.920
that are highly tolerant
of drought, of flood,

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:09.467
of pests and pesticides.

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:10.665
Now, look --

00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:13.558
as long as we continue
to increase the population,

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:16.761
we'll have to continue to grow and eat
genetically modified foods.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:18.936
And that's the only position
I'll take today.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.778
Unless there's anybody in the audience

00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:23.023
who'd like to volunteer to stop eating?

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.398
None, not one.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.162
This is a typewriter,

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.315
a staple of every desktop for decades.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.923
And, in fact, the typewriter
was essentially deleted by this thing.

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:36.768
And then more general versions
of word processors came about.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.571
But ultimately, it was a disruption
on top of a disruption.

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.663
It was Bob Metcalfe
inventing the Ethernet,

00:07:41.687 --> 00:07:43.656
and the connection of all these computers

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.530
that fundamentally changed everything.

00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:48.355
Suddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:51.236
And we had, indeed,
the entire dot-com bubble.

00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:53.828
(Laughter)

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.003
Not to worry though,

00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:58.602
that was quickly rescued
by the iPod, Facebook

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.729
and, indeed, Angry Birds.

00:08:00.753 --> 00:08:02.729
(Laughter)

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.651
Look, this is where we are today.

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:08.465
This is the genomic revolution today.
This is where we are.

00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:10.069
What I'd like you to consider is:

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:11.498
What does it mean

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:14.879
when these dots don't represent
the individual bases of your genome,

00:08:14.903 --> 00:08:17.754
but they connect to genomes
all across the planet?

00:08:17.778 --> 00:08:21.366
I just recently had to buy life insurance,
and I was required to answer:

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.521
A. I have never had a genetic test;

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.028
B. I've had one, here you go;

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:26.997
or C. I've had one and I'm not telling.

00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:28.737
Thankfully, I was able to answer A,

00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:32.309
and I say that honestly, in case
my life insurance agent is listening.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:34.732
But what would have happened
if I had said C?

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:37.157
Consumer applications
for genomics will flourish.

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.630
Do you want to see
if you're genetically compatible

00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:40.884
with your girlfriend?

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:43.871
DNA sequencing on your iPhone?
There's an app for that.

00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:45.236
(Laughter)

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.990
Personalized genomic massage, anyone?

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:53.605
There's already a lab today that tests
for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:55.013
the so-called cheating gene.

00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:57.052
(Laughter)

00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:59.703
So anybody who's here today
with your significant other,

00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:02.594
just turn over to them,
swab their mouth, send it to the lab

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:03.887
and you'll know for sure.

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:05.022
(Laughter)

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:06.988
Do you really want to elect a president

00:09:07.012 --> 00:09:09.274
whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.158
Think of it -- it's 2016,

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:12.888
and the leading candidate releases

00:09:12.912 --> 00:09:14.994
not only her four years
of back-tax returns,

00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:16.471
but also her personal genome.

00:09:16.495 --> 00:09:17.705
And it looks really good.

00:09:17.729 --> 00:09:20.325
Then she challenges all
her competitors to do the same.

00:09:20.349 --> 00:09:22.284
Do you think that's not going to happen?

00:09:22.308 --> 00:09:24.542
Do you think it would have
helped John McCain?

00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:26.359
(Laughter)

00:09:26.383 --> 00:09:29.601
How many people in the audience
have the last name Resnick, like me?

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:30.783
Raise your hand.

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:31.980
Anybody? Nobody.

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:33.880
Typically, there's one or two.

00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:36.457
So my father's father
was one of 10 Resnick brothers.

00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:40.566
They all hated each other, and all moved
to different parts of the planet.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.509
So it's likely I'm related
to every Resnick that I ever meet,

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:44.684
but I don't know.

00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:47.745
So imagine if my genome
were De-identified, sitting in software,

00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:50.153
And a third cousin's genome
was also sitting there,

00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:52.478
and there was software
that could compare the two

00:09:52.502 --> 00:09:53.859
and make these associations.

00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:57.191
Not hard to imagine. My company
has software that does this right now.

00:09:57.215 --> 00:09:58.383
Imagine one more thing,

00:09:58.407 --> 00:10:01.642
that that software is able to ask
both parties for mutual consent:

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.991
"Would you be willing
to meet your third cousin?"

00:10:04.015 --> 00:10:05.665
And if we both say yes -- voilà!

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.466
Welcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.715
(Laughter)

00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:13.801
Now this is probably a good thing, right?

00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:15.413
Bigger clan gatherings and so on.

00:10:15.437 --> 00:10:17.138
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.

00:10:17.162 --> 00:10:19.443
How many fathers in the room?
Raise your hands.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:22.795
OK, so experts think
that one to three percent of you

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:24.922
are not actually the father of your child.

00:10:24.946 --> 00:10:26.700
(Laughter)

00:10:26.724 --> 00:10:27.900
Look --

00:10:27.924 --> 00:10:31.900
(Laughter)

00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:35.236
These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.625
they don't in any way represent
the quality of our relationships

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:41.342
or the nature of our society --
at least not yet.

00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.161
And like any new technology,

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.974
it's really in humanity's hands

00:10:44.998 --> 00:10:47.196
to wield it for the betterment of mankind

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.371
or not.

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:50.618
And so I urge you all
to wake up and to tune in

00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:54.038
and to influence the genomic revolution
that's happening all around you.

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:55.213
Thank you.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.680
(Applause)
