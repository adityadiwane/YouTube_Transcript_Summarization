00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:19.177
So if I told you that
this was the face of pure joy,

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:21.968
would you call me crazy?

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:23.918
I wouldn't blame you,

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:28.172
because every time I look at this
Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.919
I want to tell you
a little bit about this photograph.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.485
I was swimming around
in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.190
just inside the Arctic Circle,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.348
and the water was hovering
right at freezing.

00:00:40.348 --> 00:00:44.179
The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.615
and I could literally feel the blood
trying to leave my hands,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.375
feet and face, and rush
to protect my vital organs.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.149
It was the coldest I've ever been.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.921
But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes,
and cheeks flushed red,

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:05.867
I have found that this place right here
is somewhere I can find great joy.

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:09.627
Now, when it comes to pain,
psychologist Brock Bastian

00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:11.972
probably said it best when he wrote,

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.549
"Pain is a kind of shortcut
to mindfulness.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.218
It makes us suddenly aware
of everything in the environment.

00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:20.192
It brutally draws us in

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:24.718
to a virtual sensory awareness
of the world much like meditation."

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:28.537
If shivering is a form of meditation,
then I would consider myself a monk.

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:29.387
(Laughter)

00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:32.266
Now, before we get into the why

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.981
would anyone ever want to surf
in freezing cold water?

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.558
I would love to give you
a little perspective

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:41.162
on what a day in my life can look like.

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:47.799
(Music)

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:31.544
(Video) Man: I mean, I know
we were hoping for good waves,

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:34.424
but I don't think anybody thought
that was going to happen.

00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:36.095
I can't stop shaking.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.919
I am so cold.

00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:43.432
(Music)

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:46.185
(Applause)

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.804
Chris Burkard: So,
surf photographer, right?

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.708
I don't even know
if it's a real job title, to be honest.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.844
My parents definitely didn't think so

00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:01.718
when I told them at 19 I was quitting
my job to pursue this dream career:

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:06.294
blue skies, warm tropical beaches,
and a tan that lasts all year long.

00:03:06.294 --> 00:03:10.125
I mean, to me, this was it.
Life could not get any better.

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:14.769
Sweating it out, shooting surfers
in these exotic tourist destinations.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.510
But there was just this one problem.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.109
You see, the more time I spent traveling
to these exotic locations,

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.534
the less gratifying it seemed to be.

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:26.909
I set out seeking adventure,
and what I was finding was only routine.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:32.439
It was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining,
and a constant cellular connection

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.411
that to me were all the trappings
of places heavily touristed

00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.709
in and out of the water,

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.376
and it didn't take long
for me to start feeling suffocated.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:47.223
I began craving wild, open spaces,

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:50.665
and so I set out to find the places
others had written off

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.543
as too cold, too remote,
and too dangerous to surf,

00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:57.353
and that challenge intrigued me.

00:03:57.353 --> 00:04:01.485
I began this sort of personal crusade
against the mundane,

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.109
because if there's
one thing I've realized,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.961
it's that any career,

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:09.722
even one as seemingly glamorous
as surf photography,

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:12.148
has the danger of becoming monotonous.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:15.702
So in my search to break up
this monotony, I realized something:

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:18.656
There's only about a third
of the Earth's oceans that are warm,

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.587
and it's really just that thin band
around the equator.

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:24.095
So if I was going to find perfect waves,

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.672
it was probably going
to happen somewhere cold,

00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:28.553
where the seas are notoriously rough,

00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:31.246
and that's exactly where I began to look.

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:33.777
And it was my first trip to Iceland

00:04:33.777 --> 00:04:36.496
that I felt like I found
exactly what I was looking for.

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:40.023
I was blown away
by the natural beauty of the landscape,

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:44.219
but most importantly, I couldn't believe
we were finding perfect waves

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.229
in such a remote and rugged
part of the world.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.915
At one point, we got to the beach

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.018
only to find massive chunks of ice
had piled on the shoreline.

00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.371
They created this barrier
between us and the surf,

00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.761
and we had to weave 
through this thing like a maze

00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:59.348
just to get out into the lineup.

00:04:59.348 --> 00:05:00.473
and once we got there,

00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:03.511
we were pushing aside these ice chunks
trying to get into waves.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.468
It was an incredible experience,
one I'll never forget,

00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:10.254
because amidst those harsh conditions,

00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:14.976
I felt like I stumbled onto
one of the last quiet places,

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:17.991
somewhere that I found a clarity
and a connection with the world

00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:20.913
I knew I would never find
on a crowded beach.

00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:25.231
I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)

00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:28.087
Cold water was constantly on my mind,

00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:29.399
and from that point on,

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:32.729
my career focused on these types of harsh
and unforgiving environments,

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.605
and it took me to places like Russia,
Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:39.534
the Faroe Islands,
and a lot of places in between.

00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:42.552
And one of my favorite things
about these places

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:46.453
was simply the challenge and
the creativity it took just to get there:

00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:48.659
hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.828
trying to pinpoint any remote stretch
of beach or reef we could actually get to.

00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:56.848
And once we got there,
the vehicles were just as creative:

00:05:56.848 --> 00:05:59.757
snowmobiles, six-wheel
Soviet troop carriers,

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:03.054
and a couple of super-sketchy
helicopter flights.

00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:05.260
(Laughter)

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.920
Helicopters really scare me, by the way.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.042
There was this one particularly
bumpy boat ride

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:14.158
up the coast of Vancouver Island
to this kind of remote surf spot,

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.777
where we ended up watching
helplessly from the water

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:19.168
as bears ravaged our camp site.

00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:22.188
They walked off with our food
and bits of our tent,

00:06:22.188 --> 00:06:25.400
clearly letting us know that we
were at the bottom of the food chain

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.527
and that this was their spot, not ours.

00:06:27.527 --> 00:06:29.454
But to me, that trip

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:34.046
was a testament to the wildness
I traded for those touristy beaches.

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:40.120
Now, it wasn't until I traveled
to Norway -- (Laughter) --

00:06:40.123 --> 00:06:43.204
that I really learned
to appreciate the cold.

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:46.206
So this is the place

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.573
where some of the largest,
the most violent storms in the world

00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:52.627
send huge waves smashing
into the coastline.

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:56.605
We were in this tiny, remote fjord,
just inside the Arctic Circle.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:59.151
It had a greater population
of sheep than people,

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:02.201
so help if we needed it
was nowhere to be found.

00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:05.151
I was in the water 
taking pictures of surfers,

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.281
and it started to snow.

00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.867
And then the temperature began to drop.

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:15.843
And I told myself, there's not a chance
you're getting out of the water.

00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:19.437
You traveled all this way, and this is
exactly what you've been waiting for:

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:21.519
freezing cold conditions
with perfect waves.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.537
And although I couldn't even feel
my finger to push the trigger,

00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.049
I knew I wasn't getting out.

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:28.842
So I just did whatever I could.
I shook it off, whatever.

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:30.525
But that was the point that I felt

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:32.644
this wind gush through
the valley and hit me,

00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:38.056
and what started as this light snowfall
quickly became a full-on blizzard,

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:42.226
and I started to lose
perception of where I was.

00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:46.092
I didn't know if I was drifting
out to sea or towards shore,

00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:50.047
and all I could really make out
was the faint sound of seagulls

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:52.170
and crashing waves.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.646
Now, I knew this place had a reputation
for sinking ships and grounding planes,

00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:02.037
and while I was out there floating,
I started to get a little bit nervous.

00:08:02.609 --> 00:08:04.977
Actually, I was totally freaking out --

00:08:04.977 --> 00:08:08.414
(Laughter) -- and I was
borderline hypothermic,

00:08:08.414 --> 00:08:11.595
and my friends eventually
had to help me out of the water.

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:14.752
And I don't know if it was
delirium setting in or what,

00:08:14.752 --> 00:08:16.912
but they told me later

00:08:16.912 --> 00:08:21.091
I had a smile on my face the entire time.

00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:24.528
Now, it was this trip

00:08:24.528 --> 00:08:28.312
and probably that exact experience
where I really began to feel

00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:32.272
like every photograph was precious,

00:08:32.272 --> 00:08:36.302
because all of a sudden in that moment,
it was something I was forced to earn.

00:08:37.352 --> 00:08:42.257
And I realized, all this shivering
had actually taught me something:

00:08:42.257 --> 00:08:46.270
In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.893
Anything that is worth pursuing
is going to require us to suffer

00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:52.855
just a little bit,

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:56.547
and that tiny bit of suffering
that I did for my photography,

00:08:56.547 --> 00:08:59.844
it added a value to my work
that was so much more meaningful to me

00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:02.180
than just trying to fill
the pages of magazines.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.208
See, I gave a piece of myself
in these places,

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:12.755
and what I walked away with

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:17.046
was a sense of fulfillment
I had always been searching for.

00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:21.298
So I look back at this photograph.

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:26.018
It's easy to see frozen fingers
and cold wetsuits

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:29.082
and even the struggle
that it took just to get there,

00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:33.128
but most of all,
what I see is just joy.

00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:35.996
Thank you so much.

00:09:35.996 --> 00:09:41.383
(Applause)
