00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.340
When I was a child,
I knew I had superpowers.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.955
That's right.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.076
(Laughter)

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.116
I thought I was absolutely amazing
because I could understand

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.276
and relate to the feelings
of brown people,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.700
like my grandfather,
a conservative Muslim guy.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.076
And also, I could understand
my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.900
not so religious
but laid-back, fairly liberal.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.916
And of course, I could understand

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.356
and relate to the feelings
of white people.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.220
The white Norwegians of my country.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.876
You know, white, brown, whatever --

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.716
I loved them all.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.996
I understood them all,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.356
even if they didn't always
understand each other;

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.620
they were all my people.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.356
My father, though,
was always really worried.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.716
He kept saying that
even with the best education,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.916
I was not going to get a fair shake.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.356
I would still face discrimination,
according to him.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.196
And that the only way
to be accepted by white people

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.396
would be to become famous.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.420
Now, mind you, he had this conversation
with me when I was seven years old.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.236
So while I'm seven years old, he said,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.636
"Look, so it's either got to be sports,
or it's got to be music."

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.116
He didn't know anything about sports --
bless him -- so it was music.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.476
So when I was seven years old,
he gathered all my toys, all my dolls,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.100
and he threw them all away.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.836
In exchange he gave me
a crappy little Casio keyboard and --

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.076
(Laughter)

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.116
Yeah. And singing lessons.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.916
And he forced me, basically, to practice
for hours and hours every single day.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.196
Very quickly, he also had me performing
for larger and larger audiences,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.996
and bizarrely, I became
almost a kind of poster child

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.100
for Norwegian multiculturalism.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.316
I felt very proud, of course.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.676
Because even the newspapers at this point

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.276
were starting to write
nice things about brown people,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.460
so I could feel
that my superpower was growing.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.756
So when I was 12 years old,
walking home from school,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.996
I took a little detour

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.555
because I wanted to buy
my favorite sweets called "salty feet."

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.340
I know they sound kind of awful,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.956
but I absolutely love them.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.420
They're basically these little
salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.180
And now that I say it out loud,
I realize how terrible that sounds,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.596
but be that as it may,
I absolutely love them.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.716
So on my way into the store,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.276
there was this grown white guy
in the doorway blocking my way.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.236
So I tried to walk around him,
and as I did that, he stopped me

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.060
and he was staring at me,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.956
and he spit in my face, and he said,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.196
"Get out of my way

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.476
you little black bitch,
you little Paki bitch,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.420
go back home where you came from."

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.516
I was absolutely horrified.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.836
I was staring at him.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.780
I was too afraid
to wipe the spit off my face,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.796
even as it was mixing with my tears.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.516
I remember looking around,
hoping that any minute now,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.196
a grown-up is going to come
and make this guy stop.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.540
But instead, people kept hurrying past me
and pretended not to see me.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.580
I was very confused
because I was thinking, well,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.756
"My white people, come on!
Where are they? What's going on?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.900
How come they're not
coming and rescuing me?"

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.836
So, needless to say,
I didn't buy the sweets.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.980
I just ran home as fast as I could.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.940
Things were still OK, though, I thought.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.716
As time went on,
the more successful I became,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.860
I eventually started also
attracting harassment from brown people.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.636
Some men in my parent's community
felt that it was unacceptable

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.516
and dishonorable for a woman
to be involved in music

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.500
and to be so present in the media.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.516
So very quickly, I was starting
to become attacked at my own concerts.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.556
I remember one of the concerts,
I was onstage, I lean into the audience

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.836
and the last thing I see
is a young brown face,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.076
and the next thing I know is some sort
of chemical is thrown in my eyes

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.316
and I remember I couldn't really see
and my eyes were watering

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.940
but I kept singing anyway.

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:33.380
I was spit in the face in the streets
of Oslo, this time by brown men.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.396
They even tried to kidnap me at one point.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.476
The death threats were endless.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.756
I remember one older bearded guy
stopped me in the street one time,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.916
and he said, "The reason
I hate you so much

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.996
is because you make our daughters think

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.580
they can do whatever they want."

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.196
A younger guy warned me to watch my back.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.236
He said music is un-Islamic
and the job of whores,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.996
and if you keep this up,
you are going to be raped

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.700
and your stomach will be cut out so that
another whore like you will not be born.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.076
Again, I was so confused.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.005
I couldn't understand what was going on.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.709
My brown people now starting
to treat me like this -- how come?

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.476
Instead of bridging the worlds,
the two worlds,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500
I felt like I was falling
between my two worlds.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.420
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.396
So by the time I was 17 years old,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.436
the death threats were endless,
and the harassment was constant.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.222
It got so bad, at one point
my mother sat me down and said,

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:35.716
"Look, we can no longer protect you,
we can no longer keep you safe,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.516
so you're going to have to go."

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.940
So I bought a one-way ticket to London,
I packed my suitcase and I left.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.676
My biggest heartbreak at that point
was that nobody said anything.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.060
I had a very public exit from Norway.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.476
My brown people, my white people --
nobody said anything.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.620
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.476
Support this girl, protect this girl,
because she is one of us."

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.116
Nobody said that.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.180
Instead, I felt like --
you know at the airport,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.796
on the baggage carousel
you have these different suitcases

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.076
going around and around,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.596
and there's always
that one suitcase left at the end,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.636
the one that nobody wants,
the one that nobody comes to claim.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.940
I felt like that.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.260
I'd never felt so alone.
I'd never felt so lost.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.180
So, after coming to London,
I did eventually resume my music career.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.020
Different place, but unfortunately
the same old story.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.196
I remember a message sent to me
saying that I was going to be killed

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.596
and that rivers of blood
were going to flow

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.076
and that I was going to be raped
many times before I died.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.516
By this point, I have to say,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.996
I was actually getting used
to messages like this,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.300
but what became different was that
now they started threatening my family.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.820
So once again, I packed my suitcase,
I left music and I moved to the US.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.596
I'd had enough.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.236
I didn't want to have anything
to do with this anymore.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.916
And I was certainly not
going to be killed for something

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.620
that wasn't even my dream --
it was my father's choice.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.196
So I kind of got lost.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.756
I kind of fell apart.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.116
But I decided that what I wanted to do

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.476
is spend the next
however many years of my life

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.156
supporting young people

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.076
and to try to be there in some small way,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.796
whatever way that I could.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.076
I started volunteering
for various organizations

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.740
that were working
with young Muslims inside of Europe.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.916
And, to my surprise, what I found was

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.420
so many of these young people
were suffering and struggling.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.796
They were facing so many problems
with their families and their communities

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.436
who seemed to care more
about their honor and their reputation

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.220
than the happiness
and the lives of their own kids.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.580
I started feeling like maybe I wasn't
so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.420
Maybe there are more
of my people out there.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.316
The thing is, what most people
don't understand

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.636
is that there are so many of us
growing up in Europe

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.076
who are not free to be ourselves.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.180
We're not allowed to be who we are.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.236
We are not free to marry

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.196
or to be in relationships
with people that we choose.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.876
We can't even pick our own career.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.676
This is the norm in the Muslim
heartlands of Europe.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.780
Even in the freest societies
in the world, we're not free.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.356
Our lives, our dreams, our future
does not belong to us,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.636
it belongs to our parents
and their community.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.740
I found endless stories of young people

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.595
who are lost to all of us,

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:47.355
who are invisible to all of us

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:50.180
but who are suffering,
and they are suffering alone.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.660
Kids we are losing to forced marriages,
to honor-based violence and abuse.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.796
Eventually, I realized after several
years of working with these young people,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.836
that I will not be able to keep running.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.516
I can't spend the rest of my life
being scared and hiding

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.980
and that I'm actually
going to have to do something.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.556
And I also realized
that my silence, our silence,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.900
allows abuse like this to continue.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.316
So I decided that I wanted to put
my childhood superpower to some use

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.036
by trying to make people on the different
sides of these issues understand

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.180
what it's like to be a young person stuck
between your family and your country.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.300
So I started making films,
and I started telling these stories.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.116
And I also wanted people to understand
the deadly consequences of us

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.220
not taking these problems seriously.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.180
So the first film I made was about Banaz.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.500
She was a 17-year-old
Kurdish girl in London.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.140
She was obedient, she did
whatever her parents wanted.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.076
She tried to do everything right.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.716
She married some guy
that her parents chose for her,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.700
even though he beat
and raped her constantly.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.516
And when she tried to go
to her family for help, they said,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.796
"Well, you got to go back
and be a better wife."

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.636
Because they didn't want
a divorced daughter on their hands

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.620
because, of course, that would
bring dishonor on the family.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.100
She was beaten so badly
her ears would bleed,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.116
and when she finally left
and she found a young man that she chose

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.956
and she fell in love with,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.236
the community and the family found out

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.660
and she disappeared.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.100
She was found three months later.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.140
She'd been stuffed into a suitcase
and buried underneath the house.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.380
She had been strangled,
she had been beaten to death

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.100
by three men, three cousins,
on the orders of her father and uncle.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.956
The added tragedy of Banaz's story

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.876
is that she had gone to the police
in England five times asking for help,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.956
telling them that she was
going to be killed by her family.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.860
The police didn't believe her
so they didn't do anything.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.156
And the problem with this

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.556
is that not only are so many of our kids
facing these problems

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.676
within their families
and within their families' communities,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.340
but they're also meeting misunderstandings

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.980
and apathy in the countries
that they grow up in.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.156
When their own families betray them,
they look to the rest of us,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.236
and when we don't understand,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.460
we lose them.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.116
So while I was making this film,
several people said to me,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.676
"Well, Deeyah, you know,
this is just their culture,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.891
this is just what those people
do to their kids

00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:42.475
and we can't really interfere."

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.900
I can assure you
being murdered is not my culture.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.316
You know?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.036
And surely people who look like me,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.556
young women who come
from backgrounds like me,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.676
should be subject to the same rights,
the same protections

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.700
as anybody else in our country, why not?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.916
So, for my next film,
I wanted to try and understand

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.796
why some of our young
Muslim kids in Europe

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.900
are drawn to extremism and violence.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.956
But with that topic,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.140
I also recognized that I was going
to have to face my worst fear:

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.460
the brown men with beards.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.516
The same men, or similar men,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.340
to the ones that have hounded me
for most of my life.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.076
Men that I've been afraid of
most of my life.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.956
Men that I've also deeply disliked,

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.420
for many, many years.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.956
So I spent the next two years
interviewing convicted terrorists,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.476
jihadis and former extremists.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.836
What I already knew,
what was very obvious already,

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.036
was that religion, politics,
Europe's colonial baggage,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.316
also Western foreign policy
failures of recent years,

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.820
were all a part of the picture.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.596
But what I was more interested
in finding out was what are the human,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.196
what are the personal reasons

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.540
why some of our young people
are susceptible to groups like this.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.180
And what really surprised me
was that I found wounded human beings.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.036
Instead of the monsters
that I was looking for,

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.436
that I was hoping to find --

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.596
quite frankly because
it would have been very satisfying --

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.220
I found broken people.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.836
Just like Banaz,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.116
I found that these young men
were torn apart

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.676
from trying to bridge the gaps

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.180
between their families
and the countries that they were born in.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.916
And what I also learned
is that extremist groups, terrorist groups

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.396
are taking advantage
of these feelings of our young people

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.276
and channeling that -- cynically --
channeling that toward violence.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.876
"Come to us," they say.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.876
"Reject both sides,
your family and your country

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.556
because they reject you.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.676
For your family, their honor
is more important than you

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.956
and for your country,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.860
a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person
will always be white and never you."

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.316
They're also promising our young people
the things that they crave:

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.676
significance, heroism,
a sense of belonging and purpose,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.100
a community that loves and accepts them.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.956
They make the powerless feel powerful.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.860
The invisible and the silent
are finally seen and heard.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.476
This is what they're doing
for our young people.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.340
Why are these groups doing this
for our young people and not us?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.156
The thing is,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.516
I'm not trying to justify

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.276
or excuse any of the violence.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.876
What I am trying to say
is that we have to understand

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.060
why some of our young people
are attracted to this.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.836
I would like to also show you, actually --

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.140
these are childhood photos
of some of the guys in the film.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.020
What really struck me
is that so many of them --

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.436
I never would have thought this --

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.780
but so many of them
have absent or abusive fathers.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.556
And several of these young guys

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.716
ended up finding caring
and compassionate father figures

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.340
within these extremist groups.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.900
I also found men
brutalized by racist violence,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.876
but who found a way
to stop feeling like victims

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.396
by becoming violent themselves.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.716
In fact, I found something,
to my horror, that I recognized.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:37.060
I found the same feelings that I felt
as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.356
The same confusion, the same sorrow,

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.860
the same feeling of being betrayed

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.180
and not belonging to anyone.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.500
The same feeling of being lost
and torn between cultures.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.116
Having said that,
I did not choose destruction,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.876
I chose to pick up a camera
instead of a gun.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.236
And the reason I did that
is because of my superpower.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.156
I could see that understanding
is the answer, instead of violence.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.876
Seeing human beings

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.636
with all their virtues and all their flaws

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.516
instead of continuing the caricatures:

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.196
the us and them, the villains and victims.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.316
I'd also finally
come to terms with the fact

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.996
that my two cultures
didn't have to be on a collision course

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.140
but instead became a space
where I found my own voice.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.396
I stopped feeling
like I had to pick a side,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.500
but this took me many, many years.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.476
There are so many
of our young people today

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.516
who are struggling with these same issues,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.540
and they're struggling with this alone.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.900
And this leaves them open like wounds.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.436
And for some, the worldview
of radical Islam

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.820
becomes the infection
that festers in these open wounds.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.980
There's an African proverb that says,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.796
"If the young are not
initiated into the village,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.580
they will burn it down
just to feel its warmth."

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.540
I would like to ask --

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.996
to Muslim parents and Muslim communities,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.436
will you love and care for your children

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.236
without forcing them
to meet your expectations?

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.700
Can you choose them instead of your honor?

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.235
Can you understand
why they're so angry and alienated

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.580
when you put your honor
before their happiness?

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.916
Can you try to be a friend to your child

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:28.716
so that they can trust you

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.035
and want to share with you
their experiences,

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.300
rather than having
to seek it somewhere else?

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:37.260
And to our young people
tempted by extremism,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.140
can you acknowledge
that your rage is fueled by pain?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.876
Will you find the strength
to resist those cynical old men

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.100
who want to use your blood
for their own profits?

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.780
Can you find a way to live?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.956
Can you see that the sweetest revenge

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.436
is for you to live
a happy, full and free life?

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.820
A life defined by you and nobody else.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.060
Why do you want to become
just another dead Muslim kid?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.060
And for the rest of us, when will we start
listening to our young people?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.596
How can we support them

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.580
in redirecting their pain
into something more constructive?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.036
They think we don't like them.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.836
They think we don't care
what happens to them.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.636
They think we don't accept them.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.380
Can we find a way
to make them feel differently?

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.036
What will it take for us
to see them and notice them

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.996
before they become either the victims
or the perpetrators of violence?

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.596
Can we make ourselves care about them
and consider them to be our own?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.476
And not just be outraged when the victims
of violence look like ourselves?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.516
Can we find a way to reject hatred
and heal the divisions between us?

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.516
The thing is we cannot afford
to give up on each other or on our kids,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.676
even if they've given up on us.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.876
We are all in this together.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:04.380
And in the long term, revenge and violence
will not work against extremists.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.076
Terrorists want us
to huddle in our houses in fear,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.276
closing our doors and our hearts.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.116
They want us to tear open
more wounds in our societies

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.676
so that they can use them
to spread their infection more widely.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.396
They want us to become like them:

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.660
intolerant, hateful and cruel.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.476
The day after the Paris attacks,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.900
a friend of mine
sent this photo of her daughter.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.076
This is a white girl and an Arab girl.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.300
They're best friends.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.420
This image is the kryptonite
for extremists.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.116
These two little girls
with their superpowers

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.636
are showing the way forward

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.060
towards a society
that we need to build together,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.260
a society that includes and supports,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.500
rather than rejects our kids.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.116
Thank you for listening.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:07.352
(Applause)
