00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.482
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:20.236
I've been making games
online now for 10 years,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.236
and my goal for the next decade

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.656
is to try to make it as easy
to save the world in real life

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.236
as it is to save the world
in online games.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:33.877
Now, I have a plan for this,

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.814
and it entails convincing more people,

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:41.695
including all of you, to spend more time
playing bigger and better games.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.236
Right now we spend three billion hours
a week playing online games.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.236
Some of you might be thinking,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.403
"That's a lot of time
to spend playing games.

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:51.729
Maybe too much time,

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:55.236
considering how many urgent problems
we have to solve in the real world."

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.236
But actually, according to my research
at the Institute for the Future,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.236
actually the opposite is true.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.585
Three billion hours a week
is not nearly enough game play

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.007
to solve the world's most urgent problems.

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.650
In fact, I believe
that if we want to survive

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:12.236
the next century on this planet,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.783
we need to increase
that total dramatically.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.785
I've calculated the total we need

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.847
at 21 billion hours
of game play every week.

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:23.449
So, that's probably a bit
of a counter-intuitive idea,

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:26.014
so I'll say it again, let it sink in:

00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:28.236
If we want to solve problems like hunger,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.506
poverty, climate change,
global conflict, obesity,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.546
I believe that we need to aspire
to play games online

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.142
for at least 21 billion hours a week,
by the end of the next decade.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.174
(Laughter)

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.316
No. I'm serious. I am.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.491
Here's why.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.758
This picture pretty much sums up
why I think games are so essential

00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:48.921
to the future survival
of the human species.

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:49.949
(Laughter)

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.124
Truly.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.765
This is a portrait
by photographer Phil Toledano.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.029
He wanted to capture
the emotion of gaming,

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.163
so he set up a camera in front
of gamers while they were playing.

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:02.112
And this is a classic gaming emotion.

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:04.041
Now, if you're not a gamer,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.462
you might miss some
of the nuance in this photo.

00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:09.236
You probably see the sense of urgency,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.644
a little bit of fear,
but intense concentration,

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:16.236
deep, deep focus on tackling
a really difficult problem.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.997
If you are a gamer, you will notice
a few nuances here:

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.810
the crinkle of the eyes up,
and around the mouth

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.429
is a sign of optimism,

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:26.888
and the eyebrows up is surprise.

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:31.039
This is a gamer who's on the verge
of something called an "epic win."

00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:32.236
(Laughter)

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.666
Oh, you've heard of that.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.222
OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:40.492
An epic win is an outcome
that is so extraordinarily positive,

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:43.532
you had no idea it was even
possible until you achieved it.

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:47.815
It was almost beyond the threshold
of imagination, and when you get there,

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.498
you're shocked to discover
what you're truly capable of.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.680
That's an epic win.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.088
This is a gamer on the verge
of an epic win.

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:56.525
And this is the face that we need to see

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.236
on millions of problem-solvers
all over the world

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.581
as we try to tackle the obstacles
of the next century --

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:05.236
the face of someone who, against all odds,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.157
is on the verge of an epic win.

00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.497
Now, unfortunately this is more
of the face that we see

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.292
in everyday life now as we try
to tackle urgent problems.

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:15.815
This is what I call
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.339
This is actually me making it.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.616
Can you see? Yes. Good.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.236
This is me making
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.641
This is a piece of graffiti
in my old neighborhood

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:25.920
in Berkeley, California,
where I did my PhD

00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:29.158
on why we're better in games
than we are in real life.

00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:31.461
And this is a problem
that a lot of gamers have.

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:35.762
We feel that we are not as good
in reality as we are in games.

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:39.236
I don't mean just good as in successful,
although that's part of it.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.105
We do achieve more in game worlds.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.095
But I also mean good as in motivated
to do something that matters --

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.903
inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.379
And when we're in game worlds,

00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:52.460
I believe that many of us become
the best version of ourselves --

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:54.602
the most likely to help
at a moment's notice,

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:57.467
the most likely to stick
with a problem as long at it takes,

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.577
to get up after failure and try again.

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:03.236
And in real life, when we face failure,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.150
when we confront obstacles,
we often don't feel that way.

00:04:06.174 --> 00:04:09.016
We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.780
we feel anxious, maybe depressed,
frustrated or cynical.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:15.360
We never have those feelings
when we're playing games,

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:16.923
they just don't exist in games.

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:20.004
So that's what I wanted to study
when I was a graduate student.

00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:22.500
What about games makes it impossible

00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:24.977
to feel that we can't achieve everything?

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.405
How can we take those feelings from games

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:29.092
and apply them to real-world work?

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:31.514
So I looked at games
like World of Warcraft,

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:34.823
which is really the ideal collaborative
problem-solving environment.

00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:36.671
And I started to notice a few things

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:39.852
that make epic wins
so possible in online worlds.

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:43.161
The first thing is whenever you show up
in one of these online games,

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:44.764
especially in World of Warcraft,

00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:47.082
there are lots and lots
of different characters

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:51.360
who are willing to trust you
with a world-saving mission, right away.

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:52.885
But not just any mission,

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.725
it's a mission that is perfectly matched
with your current level in the game.

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.455
Right? So you can do it.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.924
They never give you a challenge
you can't achieve.

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.323
But it is on the verge
of what you're capable of,

00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:04.591
so you have to try hard.

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:07.936
But there's no unemployment
in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.111
wringing your hands --

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:11.954
there's always something
specific and important to be done.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.811
There are also tons of collaborators.

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.223
Everywhere you go,
hundreds of thousands of people

00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:19.189
ready to work with you
to achieve your epic mission.

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:21.839
That's not something we have
in real life that easily,

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.852
this sense that at our fingertips
are tons of collaborators.

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:28.367
And there's this epic story,
this inspiring story of why we're there,

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.552
and what we're doing,

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:31.454
and we get all this positive feedback.

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:35.471
You guys have heard of leveling up,
+1 strength, +1 intelligence.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:38.177
We don't get that kind
of constant feedback in real life.

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.442
When I get off this stage,

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:44.348
I'm not going to have
+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,

00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:46.036
+20 crazy idea.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.078
I don't get that feedback in real life.

00:05:48.102 --> 00:05:52.950
Now, the problem with collaborative
online environments like World of Warcraft

00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:57.129
is that it's so satisfying to be
on the verge of an epic win all the time,

00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:59.728
we decide to spend all our time
in these game worlds.

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:01.236
It's just better than reality.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.236
So, so far, collectively
all the World of Warcraft gamers

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.236
have spent 5.93 million years

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.236
solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.420
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:15.636
It might sound like it's a bad thing.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.984
But to put that in context:

00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:19.091
5.93 million years ago

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:23.740
was when our earliest primate
human ancestors stood up.

00:06:23.764 --> 00:06:26.494
That was the first upright primate.

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:29.622
So when we talk about how much time

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:31.658
we're currently investing
in playing games,

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:34.460
the only way it makes sense
to even think about it

00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:38.236
is to talk about time
at the magnitude of human evolution,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.236
which is an extraordinary thing.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.768
But it's also apt,

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.950
because it turns out that by spending
all this time playing games,

00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:48.236
we're actually changing
what we are capable of as human beings.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.574
We're evolving to be a more
collaborative and hearty species.

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.368
This is true. I believe this.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.550
So, consider this really
interesting statistic;

00:06:56.574 --> 00:07:00.058
it was recently published by a researcher
at Carnegie Mellon University:

00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:04.236
The average young person today
in a country with a strong gamer culture

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.914
will have spent 10,000 hours
playing online games

00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:09.184
by the age of 21.

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:13.005
Now 10,000 hours is a really
interesting number for two reasons.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.126
First of all, for children
in the United States,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.134
10,080 hours is the exact amount
of time you will spend in school,

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:24.260
from fifth grade
to high school graduation,

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:25.807
if you have perfect attendance.

00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:26.832
(Laughter)

00:07:26.856 --> 00:07:30.441
So, we have an entire
parallel track of education going on,

00:07:30.465 --> 00:07:34.173
where young people are learning as much
about what it takes to be a good gamer

00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:36.677
as they're learning
about everything else in school.

00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:40.288
Some of you have probably read
Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:42.654
so you would have heard
of his theory of success,

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:44.777
the "10,000 hours" theory of success.

00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:47.236
It's based on this great
cognitive-science research

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.577
that says if we can master 10,000 hours

00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:53.974
of effortful study at anything
by the age of 21,

00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:55.497
we will be virtuosos at it.

00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.236
We will be as good at whatever we do

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.101
as the greatest people in the world.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.883
And so, now what we're looking at

00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:05.788
is an entire generation of young people
who are virtuoso gamers.

00:08:07.018 --> 00:08:09.236
So, the big question is,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.577
"What exactly are gamers
getting so good at?"

00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:14.386
Because if we could figure that out,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.815
we would have a virtually unprecedented
human resource on our hands.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.102
This is how many people
we now have in the world

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:24.013
who spend at least an hour
a day playing online games.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:26.133
These are our virtuoso gamers,

00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:29.989
500 million people who are
extraordinarily good at something.

00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:32.236
And in the next decade,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
we're going to have another billion gamers

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:37.061
who are extraordinarily
good at whatever that is.

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:39.236
If you don't know it already,
this is coming.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.236
The game industry is developing consoles

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.614
that are low-energy and that work
with the wireless phone networks

00:08:44.638 --> 00:08:46.464
instead of broadband Internet,

00:08:46.488 --> 00:08:48.236
so that gamers all over the world,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.084
particularly in India, China,
Brazil, can get online.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:54.734
They expect one billion more
gamers in the next decade.

00:08:54.758 --> 00:08:56.782
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.

00:08:57.217 --> 00:08:58.685
So I've started to think about

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:00.925
what these games
are making us virtuosos at.

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:02.900
Here are the four things I came up with.

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:04.884
The first is urgent optimism.

00:09:04.908 --> 00:09:07.590
OK, think of this
as extreme self-motivation.

00:09:08.003 --> 00:09:11.051
Urgent optimism is the desire
to act immediately

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:12.732
to tackle an obstacle,

00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:16.336
combined with the belief that we have
a reasonable hope of success.

00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:19.689
Gamers always believe
that an epic win is possible,

00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:22.418
and that it's always worth
trying, and trying now.

00:09:22.442 --> 00:09:23.692
Gamers don't sit around.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:28.089
Gamers are virtuosos
at weaving a tight social fabric.

00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:30.370
There's a lot of interesting
research that shows

00:09:30.394 --> 00:09:32.950
we like people better
after we play a game with them,

00:09:32.974 --> 00:09:34.783
even if they've beaten us badly.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.149
And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust
to play a game with someone.

00:09:38.173 --> 00:09:40.465
We trust that they will spend
their time with us,

00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:42.331
that they will play by the same rules,

00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:45.687
value the same goal,
stay with the game until it's over.

00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:47.279
And so, playing a game together

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:50.236
actually builds up bonds
and trust and cooperation.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.085
And we actually build stronger
social relationships as a result.

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:56.236
Blissful productivity. I love it.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.554
You know, there's a reason why
the average World of Warcraft gamer

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:02.236
plays for 22 hours a week --
kind of a half-time job.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.862
It's because we know,
when we're playing a game,

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:07.235
that we're actually happier working hard

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:09.510
than we are relaxing, or hanging out.

00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:11.812
We know that we are
optimized as human beings,

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:13.454
to do hard and meaningful work.

00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:16.685
And gamers are willing
to work hard all the time,

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.310
if they're given the right work.

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:20.526
Finally: epic meaning.

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:24.771
Gamers love to be attached
to awe-inspiring missions

00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:28.807
to human planetary-scale stories.

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:32.571
So, just one bit of trivia
that helps put that into perspective:

00:10:32.595 --> 00:10:36.236
So, you all know Wikipedia,
biggest wiki in the world.

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:40.236
Second biggest wiki in the world,
with nearly 80,000 articles,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.236
is the World of Warcraft wiki.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.236
Five million people use it every month.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.919
They have compiled more information
about World of Warcraft on the Internet

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:51.050
than any other topic covered
on any other wiki in the world.

00:10:51.074 --> 00:10:53.110
They are building an epic story.

00:10:53.134 --> 00:10:55.356
They are building an epic
knowledge resource

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.912
about the World of Warcraft.

00:10:56.936 --> 00:11:01.236
Okay, so these are four superpowers
that add up to one thing:

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.746
Gamers are super-empowered
hopeful individuals.

00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:09.260
These are people who believe
that they are individually capable

00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:10.834
of changing the world.

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:12.493
And the only problem is,

00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:15.546
they believe that they are capable
of changing virtual worlds

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.236
and not the real world.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.373
That's the problem
that I'm trying to solve.

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:22.236
There's an economist
named Edward Castronova.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.430
His work is brilliant.

00:11:23.454 --> 00:11:26.356
He looks at why people are investing
so much time and energy

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.236
and money in online worlds.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.443
And he says,

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:32.775
"We're witnessing what amounts to
no less than a mass exodus

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:35.236
to virtual worlds and online
game environments."

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.449
And he's an economist, so he's rational.

00:11:37.473 --> 00:11:38.910
And he says --

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:40.577
(Laughter)

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.886
Not like me, I'm a game
designer; I'm exuberant.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.109
But he says that this makes perfect sense,

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:49.557
because gamers can achieve
more in online worlds

00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.907
than they can in real life.

00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:53.392
They can have stronger
social relationships in games

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:54.971
than they can have in real life;

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:57.962
they get better feedback
and feel more rewarded in games

00:11:57.986 --> 00:11:59.236
than they do in real life.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense

00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:04.859
for gamers to spend more time
in virtual worlds than the real world.

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:08.236
Now, I also agree
that that is rational, for now.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.236
But it is not, by any means,
an optimal situation.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.236
We have to start making
the real world work more like a game.

00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:17.619
I take my inspiration
from something that happened

00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:19.072
2,500 years ago.

00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:23.236
These are ancient dice,
made out of sheep's knuckles.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.236
Before we had awesome game controllers,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.073
we had sheep's knuckles.

00:12:27.097 --> 00:12:30.165
And these represent
the first game equipment

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:32.055
designed by human beings,

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:35.823
and if you're familiar with the work
of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:37.356
you might know this history,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.300
which is the history
of who invented games and why.

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:43.820
Herodotus says that games,
particularly dice games,

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:46.236
were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.069
during a time of famine.

00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:50.432
Apparently, there was such a severe famine

00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:54.236
that the king of Lydia decided
they had to do something crazy.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.356
People were suffering.
People were fighting.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.236
It was an extreme situation,
they needed an extreme solution.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.236
So, according to Herodotus,
they invented dice games,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.236
and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.842
On one day, everybody would eat,

00:13:08.866 --> 00:13:11.236
and on the next day,
everybody would play games.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.894
And they would be so immersed
in playing the dice games,

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.362
because games are so engaging,

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:18.598
and immerse us in such satisfying,
blissful productivity,

00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:21.336
they would ignore the fact
that they had no food to eat.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.646
And then on the next day,
they would play games;

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.546
and on the next day, they would eat.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.236
And according to Herodotus,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.236
they passed 18 years this way,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.999
surviving through a famine,

00:13:31.023 --> 00:13:33.689
by eating on one day,
and playing games on the next.

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:37.417
Now, this is exactly, I think,
how we're using games today.

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:40.693
We're using games to escape
real-world suffering --

00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:42.308
we're using games to get away

00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:44.921
from everything that's broken
in the real environment,

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:47.491
everything that's not satisfying
about real life,

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:49.613
and we're getting what we need from games.

00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:51.236
But it doesn't have to end there.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.236
This is really exciting.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.236
According to Herodotus, after 18 years
the famine wasn't getting better,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.700
so the king decided they would
play one final dice game.

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:05.041
They divided the entire kingdom in half.

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.137
They played one dice game,

00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:10.580
and the winners of that game
got to go on an epic adventure.

00:14:10.604 --> 00:14:12.236
They would leave Lydia,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.235
and they would go out in search
of a new place to live,

00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:17.459
leaving behind just enough people

00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:19.776
to survive on the resources
that were available,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.625
and hopefully to take their civilization
somewhere else where they could thrive.

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:25.548
Now, this sounds crazy, right?

00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:29.990
But recently, DNA evidence
has shown that the Etruscans,

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:31.776
who then led to the Roman Empire,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.705
actually share the same DNA
as the ancient Lydians.

00:14:34.729 --> 00:14:37.236
And so, recently,
scientists have suggested

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.657
that Herodotus' crazy
story is actually true.

00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:42.650
And geologists have found
evidence of a global cooling

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:46.410
that lasted for nearly 20 years,
that could have explained the famine.

00:14:46.434 --> 00:14:48.664
So this crazy story might be true.

00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:52.584
They might have actually saved
their culture by playing games,

00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:54.530
escaping to games for 18 years,

00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:56.006
and then been so inspired,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.712
and knew so much about
how to come together with games,

00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:01.473
that they actually saved
the entire civilization that way.

00:15:01.497 --> 00:15:02.662
Okay, we can do that.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:03.708
(Laughter)

00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:06.070
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.

00:15:06.094 --> 00:15:09.765
That was the first real-time strategy
game from the World of Warcraft series.

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:11.188
That was 16 years ago.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.393
They played dice games for 18 years,

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:15.663
we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.

00:15:15.687 --> 00:15:18.845
I say we are ready for our own epic game.

00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:23.479
Now, they had half the civilization
go off in search of a new world,

00:15:23.503 --> 00:15:27.352
so that's where I get my 21 billion
hours a week of game-play from.

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:29.236
Let's get half of us to agree

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.236
to spend an hour a day playing games,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.102
until we solve real-world problems.

00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:34.698
Now, I know you're asking,

00:15:34.722 --> 00:15:37.401
"How are we going to solve
real-world problems in games?"

00:15:37.425 --> 00:15:40.536
Well, that's what I've devoted
my work to over the past few years,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.236
at the Institute for the Future.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.546
We have this banner
in our offices in Palo Alto,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.395
and it expresses our view of how
we should try to relate to the future.

00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:50.966
We do not want to try
to predict the future.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.022
What we want to do is make the future.

00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:55.538
We want to imagine
the best-case scenario outcome,

00:15:55.562 --> 00:15:59.236
and then we want to empower people
to make that outcome a reality.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.236
We want to imagine epic wins,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.236
and then give people the means
to achieve the epic win.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.358
I'm just going to very briefly show you
three games that I've made

00:16:07.382 --> 00:16:10.438
that are an attempt to give people
the means to create epic wins

00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:11.795
in their own futures.

00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:13.236
This is World Without Oil.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.951
We made this game in 2007.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.333
This is an online game

00:16:16.357 --> 00:16:19.077
in which you try to survive
an oil shortage.

00:16:19.767 --> 00:16:21.362
The oil shortage is fictional,

00:16:21.386 --> 00:16:24.236
but we put enough online content out there

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.940
for you to believe that it's real,

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:28.850
and to live your real life
as if we've run out of oil.

00:16:28.874 --> 00:16:30.310
So when you come to the game,

00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:32.263
you sign up, tell us where you live,

00:16:32.287 --> 00:16:34.627
and then we give you
real-time news videos,

00:16:34.651 --> 00:16:37.771
data feeds that show you
exactly how much oil costs,

00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:40.524
what's not available, how food
supply is being affected,

00:16:40.548 --> 00:16:42.382
how transportation is being affected,

00:16:42.406 --> 00:16:44.477
if schools are closed, if there's rioting,

00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:47.350
and you have to figure out
how you would live your real life

00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:48.613
as if this were true.

00:16:48.637 --> 00:16:50.436
And then we ask you to blog about it,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.236
to post videos, to post photos.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.660
We piloted this game
with 1,700 players in 2007,

00:16:55.684 --> 00:16:58.017
and we've tracked them
for the three years since.

00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:01.118
And I can tell you that this
is a transformative experience.

00:17:01.142 --> 00:17:03.025
Nobody wants to change how they live,

00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:06.451
just because it's good for the world,
or because we're supposed to.

00:17:06.778 --> 00:17:09.236
But if you immerse them
in an epic adventure

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.236
and tell them, "We've run out of oil.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.525
This is an amazing story
and adventure for you to go on.

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:17.236
Challenge yourself to see
how you would survive,"

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.308
most of our players
have kept up the habits

00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:21.128
that they learned in this game.

00:17:21.152 --> 00:17:23.236
So for the next world-saving game,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.236
we decided to aim higher --
bigger problem than just peak oil.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:30.137
We did a game called Superstruct
at the Institute for the Future.

00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.236
And the premise was,
a supercomputer has calculated

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.236
that humans have only 23 years
left on the planet.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.809
This supercomputer was called

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:40.236
the Global Extinction
Awareness System, of course.

00:17:40.594 --> 00:17:42.236
We asked people to come online --

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.359
almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:47.236
You know Jerry Bruckheimer
movies, you form a dream team --

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.011
you've got the astronaut,
the scientist, the ex-convict,

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.472
and they all have something
to do to save the world.

00:17:52.496 --> 00:17:53.503
(Laughter)

00:17:53.527 --> 00:17:56.915
But in our game, instead of just having
five people on the dream team,

00:17:56.939 --> 00:17:58.868
we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,

00:17:58.892 --> 00:18:01.236
and it's your job to invent
the future of energy,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.236
the future of food, the future of health,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.308
the future of security and the future
of the social safety net."

00:18:06.332 --> 00:18:08.921
We had 8,000 people
play that game for eight weeks.

00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:11.993
They came up with 500
insanely creative solutions

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:14.556
that you can go online,
Google "Superstruct," and see.

00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:16.236
So, finally, the last game,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.716
we're launching it March 3rd.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.174
This is a game done
with the World Bank Institute.

00:18:20.198 --> 00:18:21.402
If you complete the game,

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:24.236
you will be certified
by the World Bank Institute

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.958
as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.

00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:30.236
Working with universities
all over sub-Saharan Africa,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.236
and we are inviting them
to learn social innovation skills.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.236
We've got a graphic novel,
we've got leveling up

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.236
in skills like local insight,
knowledge networking,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.261
sustainability,
vision and resourcefulness.

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.332
I would like to invite all of you

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:45.491
to please share this game
with young people,

00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:48.236
anywhere in the world,
particularly in developing areas,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.458
who might benefit from coming together

00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:54.191
to try to start to imagine their own
social enterprises to save the world.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.423
So, I'm going to wrap up now.

00:18:57.026 --> 00:18:58.236
I want to ask a question.

00:18:58.796 --> 00:19:00.280
What do you think happens next?

00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:03.289
We've got all these amazing gamers,
we've got these games

00:19:03.313 --> 00:19:05.425
that are kind of pilots
of what we might do,

00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:07.655
but none of them
have saved the real world yet.

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:12.028
Well I hope you will agree with me
that gamers are a human resource

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:14.236
that we can use to do real-world work,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.479
that games are a powerful
platform for change.

00:19:16.837 --> 00:19:18.829
We have all these amazing superpowers:

00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:22.236
blissful productivity, the ability
to weave a tight social fabric,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.236
this feeling of urgent optimism
and the desire for epic meaning.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.769
I really hope that we can come together
to play games that matter,

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:32.019
to survive on this planet
for another century.

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:35.695
That's my hope, that you will join me
in making and playing games like this.

00:19:35.719 --> 00:19:39.519
When I look forward to the next decade,
I know two things for sure:

00:19:39.543 --> 00:19:42.236
that we can make
any future we can imagine,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.370
and we can play any games
we want, so I say:

00:19:45.394 --> 00:19:47.110
Let the world-changing games begin.

00:19:47.134 --> 00:19:48.292
Thank you.

00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:52.490
(Applause)
