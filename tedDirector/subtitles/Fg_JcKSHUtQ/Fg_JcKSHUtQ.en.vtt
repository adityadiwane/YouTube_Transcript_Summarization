00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:20.142
It is a dream of mankind
to fly like a bird.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.236
Birds are very agile.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.594
They fly, not with rotating components,

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:28.674
so they fly only by flapping their wings.

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:31.236
So we looked at the birds,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.603
and we tried to make a model
that is powerful, ultralight,

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:41.641
and it must have excellent
aerodynamic qualities

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:45.773
that would fly by its own
and only by flapping its wings.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.236
So what would be better than to use
the herring gull, in its freedom,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.574
circling and swooping over the sea,

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.423
and to use this as a role model?

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:58.897
So we bring a team together.

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:04.001
There are generalists and also specialists
in the field of aerodynamics,

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.236
in the field of building gliders.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:11.962
And the task was to build
an ultralight indoor-flying model

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:15.163
that is able to fly over your heads.

00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:17.260
So be careful later on.

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.387
(Laughter)

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:21.521
And this was one issue:

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:23.237
to build it that lightweight

00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:28.092
that no one would be hurt if it fell down.

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:30.600
So why do we do all this?

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.547
We are a company
in the field of automation,

00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.236
and we'd like to do
very lightweight structures

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.999
because that's energy efficient,

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:44.666
and we'd like to learn more
about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:49.538
So I now would like you
to put your seat belts on

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:51.236
and put your hats on.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.875
So maybe we'll try it once --

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.379
to fly a SmartBird.

00:01:56.403 --> 00:01:57.431
Thank you.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:04.346
(Applause)

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:15.134
(Cheers)

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:18.543
(Applause)

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:31.218
(Applause ends)

00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:54.417
(Applause)

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:12.042
So we can now look at the SmartBird.

00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:15.566
So here is one without a skin.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.801
We have a wingspan of about two meters.

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:21.236
The length is one meter and six,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.447
and the weight is only 450 grams.

00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:29.236
And it is all out of carbon fiber.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.719
In the middle we have a motor,

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:35.236
and we also have a gear in it,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.875
and we use the gear
to transfer the circulation of the motor.

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.085
So within the motor,
we have three Hall sensors,

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.622
so we know exactly where the wing is.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.711
And if we now beat up and down --

00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:56.672
(Mechanical sounds)

00:03:56.696 --> 00:04:00.759
We have the possibility
to fly like a bird.

00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:04.401
So if you go down, you have
the large area of propulsion,

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:07.512
and if you go up,

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:10.236
the wings are not that large,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and it is easier to get up.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.176
So, the next thing we did,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.973
or the challenges we did,

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:23.013
was to coordinate this movement.

00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:26.226
We have to turn it, go up and go down.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.786
We have a split wing.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.236
With the split wing,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.236
we get the lift at the upper wing,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.474
and we get the propulsion
at the lower wing.

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:40.716
Also, we see how we measure
the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.970
We had knowledge
about the electromechanical efficiency

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:48.952
and then we can calculate
the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:54.296
So therefore, it rises up
from passive torsion to active torsion,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.883
from 30 percent up to 80 percent.

00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.440
Next thing we have to do,

00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:03.565
we have to control and regulate
the whole structure.

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.160
Only if you control and regulate it,

00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:09.477
you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:12.588
So the overall consumption of energy

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.816
is about 25 watts at takeoff

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.372
and 16 to 18 watts in flight.

00:05:19.396 --> 00:05:20.405
Thank you.

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:27.010
(Applause)

00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:29.582
Bruno Giussani: Markus,
we should fly it once more.

00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:31.011
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:32.103
(Audience) Yeah!

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:33.728
(Laughter)

00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:57.100
(Gasps)

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:03.863
(Cheers)

00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:06.990
(Applause)
