00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.468
I have been a police officer
for a very, very long time.

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:20.690
And you see these notes in my hand
because I'm also a black preacher.

00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:22.988
(Laughter)

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:25.227
And if you know anything
about black preachers,

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:28.463
we'll close, and then we'll keep
going for another 20 minutes.

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:29.524
(Laughter)

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:31.941
So I need this to keep
pushing this thing forward.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.214
I've been a police officer
for a very long time,

00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:35.818
and I mean I predated technology.

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.438
I'm talking about before pagers.

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:38.695
(Laughter)

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.980
Laugh if you want to,
but I'm telling the truth.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:45.706
I predate War on Our Fellow Man --
I mean, War on Drugs.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.213
I predate all of that.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:49.009
I predate so much

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.816
and I've been through ebbs and flows

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.207
and I've been through good and bad times,

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:57.389
and still I absolutely love
being a police officer.

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:01.958
I love being a police officer
because it's always been a calling for me

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:03.362
and never a job.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.584
And even with that,

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:10.814
my personal truth is that
law enforcement is in a crisis.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.130
It's an invisible crisis,

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:15.780
and it has been for many, many years.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.656
Even though we in law enforcement say,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.282
"You know what?
We can't arrest our way out of this."

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:25.069
We say in law enforcement things like,

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:27.609
"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:29.166
You know what?

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.548
In law enforcement, we even agree
that we have to adopt this thinking

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.777
and become more oriented
to community policing.

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.711
And yet all the while, still,

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:39.932
we continue in the same vein,

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:43.916
the same vein that contradicts
everything that we just admitted.

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.834
And so that's the reason for me,
several years ago.

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:51.408
Because I was tired of the racism,
I was tired of discrimination,

00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:54.025
I was tired of the "-isms"
and the schisms.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.429
I was just so tired.

00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:58.057
I was tired of the vicious cycle,

00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.310
and I was tired of it even
in the beloved agency

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:04.247
in the department that I still love today.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.900
And so my wife and I, we sat down

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.741
and we decided and we targeted
a date that we would retire.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.734
We would retire and I would
go off into the sunset,

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.591
maybe do ministry full time,
love my wife a long time.

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:17.256
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.685
(Laughter)

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.432
But we decided that I would retire.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:23.635
But then there was a higher power than I.

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:27.360
There was a love for the city

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:30.585
that I loved, that I grew up in,
that I was educated in --

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.309
a city that pulled my heart
back into the system.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.221
So we didn't retire.

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:38.310
We didn't retire

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:40.798
and so what happened was,

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:44.050
over the next -- I would say,
18 months, 19 months,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.083
I had this passion to implement
some radical policing.

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:51.124
And so now, over the next 19 months,

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:54.991
I shifted, and I transcended
from being a drug sergeant --

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.113
ready to retire as a drug sergeant --

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:00.699
and went from level to level to level,

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:03.152
until I find myself
as a district commander,

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:06.119
commander of the worst district
in Baltimore city.

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.154
We call it the Eastern District,

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:09.788
the most violent district,

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:11.519
the most impoverished district --

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:15.145
46 percent unemployment in that district.

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:18.238
National rating at that time,

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:21.234
national rating, the AIDS
and the tuberculosis [rating],

00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:23.659
was always on the top 10 list

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:26.706
for zip codes for cities
across the nation,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.469
or just zip codes across the nation.

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:31.111
The top 10 -- I didn't say state,
I didn't say city --

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.475
that little neighborhood.

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.714
And I said, you know what?
We gotta do something different.

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:39.398
We gotta do something different.
We gotta think radical.

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:41.159
We gotta think outside the box.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.412
And so in order to bring change
that I desperately wanted

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:46.143
and I desperately felt in my heart,

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.456
I had to start listening
to that inner spirit.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.913
I had to start listening
to that man on the inside

00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:54.040
that went against everything
that I had been trained to do.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.166
But we still did it.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.887
We still did it because we listened
to that inner spirit,

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.172
because I realized this:

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:04.245
if I was to see real police reform

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.898
in the communities that I had
authority over for public safety,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.973
we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:13.881
We had to change it.

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:16.628
And so what we did
is we started to think holistically

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:17.968
and not paramilitarily.

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:19.922
So we thought differently.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.018
And we started to realize

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:24.352
that it could never be
and never should have been

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:25.885
us versus them.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.118
And so I decided to come
to that intersection

00:04:29.142 --> 00:04:32.363
where I could meet all classes,
all races, all creeds, all colors;

00:04:32.387 --> 00:04:34.928
where I would meet the businesses
and the faith-based,

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:36.238
and the eds, the meds,

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.770
and I would meet all the people

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:40.623
that made up the communities
that I had authority over.

00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:43.165
So I met them and I began to listen.

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.641
See, police have a problem.

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:47.260
Off the top, we want to bring
things into the community

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:50.252
and come up with these extravagant
strategies and deployments,

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:52.451
but we never talk
to the community about them.

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:55.303
And we shove them into the community
and say, "Take that."

00:04:55.806 --> 00:04:58.203
But we said we'd get rid
of that stinkin' thinkin',

00:04:58.227 --> 00:04:59.775
so we talked to our communities.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.667
We said, "This is your community table.

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.954
We'll pull up a chair.
We want to hear from you.

00:05:03.978 --> 00:05:05.918
What's going to work in your community?"

00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:08.071
And then some great things
started to happen.

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:09.246
See, here's the thing:

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.990
I had to figure out a way to shift
130 cops that were under my tutelage

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.126
from being occupiers of communities

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.339
to being partners.

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.047
I had to figure out how to do that.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.050
Because here's the crazy thing:

00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:26.719
in law enforcement, we have evolved
into something incredible.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.680
Listen, we have become great protectors.

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:30.132
We know how to protect you.

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.948
But we have exercised that arm
so much, so very much.

00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:38.138
If I was a natural police department

00:05:38.162 --> 00:05:40.043
and I represented a police department,

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.956
you would see this incredible,
beautiful, 23-inch arm.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.583
(Laughter)

00:05:45.607 --> 00:05:47.686
It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.568
No fat on it. Mmm it look good.
It just look good!

00:05:51.592 --> 00:05:53.726
(Laughter)

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.651
That's a great arm -- protection!

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:58.778
That's who we are, but we've exercised
it so much sometimes

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:00.810
that it has led to abuse.

00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:06.004
It's led to coldness and callousness
and dehumanized us.

00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:08.093
And we've forgotten

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:09.530
the mantra across this nation

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:11.624
is to protect and serve.

00:06:12.068 --> 00:06:14.044
Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.

00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:15.069
(Laughter)

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:16.498
So you look at the other arm,

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:18.657
and then you look at it
and ... there it is.

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.854
(Laughter)

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.156
You know, it's kinda weak.

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.163
It looks sickly.

00:06:24.972 --> 00:06:26.758
It's withering and it's dying

00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.504
because we've invested so much
in our protective arm.

00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:34.159
But we forgot to treat our communities

00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:35.566
like they're our customers;

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:38.991
like they're our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters,

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:40.205
our mothers and fathers.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.849
And so somehow, along the way,

00:06:42.873 --> 00:06:44.304
we've gotten out of balance.

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.066
And because we are a proud profession,

00:06:47.952 --> 00:06:51.093
it is very hard for us to look
in the mirror and see our mistakes.

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:52.838
It's even harder to make a change.

00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:56.648
And so, as I try to hurry
and get through this,

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:58.365
I need to say this:

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.331
it's not just law enforcement, though.

00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:03.149
Because every one of us
makes up a community.

00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:05.359
Everybody makes up a community.

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:07.606
And as communities -- can I say this? --

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.002
we have put too much responsibility
on law enforcement.

00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:13.419
Too much.

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:17.686
(Applause)

00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:21.353
And then we have the audacity
and the nerve to get upset

00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:23.480
with law enforcement
when we take action.

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:25.679
There is no way in the world

00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:30.158
that we, as a community,
should be calling the police

00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:32.071
for kids playing ball in the street.

00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.807
No way in the world that we
should be calling the police

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.917
because my neighbor's
music is up too loud,

00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:41.695
because his dog came over
to my yard and did a number two;

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:44.240
there's no way we should
be calling the police.

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.906
But we have surrendered
so much of our responsibility.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.064
Listen, when I was a little boy
coming up in Baltimore --

00:07:50.088 --> 00:07:52.225
and listen, we played
rough in the street --

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:54.660
I ain't never see the police
come and break us up.

00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:56.951
You know who came? It was the elders.

00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:59.110
It was the parental figures
in the community.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.027
It was those guardians,
it was that village mentality.

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.106
They came and said, "Stop that!"
and "Do this." and "Stop that."

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:09.411
We had mentors throughout
all of the community.

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:12.009
So it takes all of us, all of us.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.820
And when I say community,

00:08:13.844 --> 00:08:16.871
I'm talking about everything
that makes up a community, even --

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:19.826
listen, because I'm a preacher,
I'm very hard on the churches,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.597
because I believe the churches
too often have become MIA,

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:23.778
missing in action.

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:26.370
I believe they have shifted
over the last 10, 20 years

00:08:26.394 --> 00:08:27.870
from being community churches,

00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:31.362
where you walk outside your door,
round the corner and you're in church.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:34.246
They shifted from that and became
commuter churches.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.730
So you now have churches who have
become disconnected by default

00:08:38.754 --> 00:08:41.209
from the very community
where they're planted.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.439
And they don't take care
of that community.

00:08:45.153 --> 00:08:47.821
I could go on and on,
but I really need to wrap this up.

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:50.496
Community and policing:

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.821
we've all lost that precious gift,
and I call it relational equity.

00:08:55.498 --> 00:08:57.421
We've lost it with one another.

00:08:57.445 --> 00:08:59.460
It's not somebody else's fault --

00:08:59.484 --> 00:09:00.808
it's all of our fault.

00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:03.337
We all take responsibility in this.

00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.562
But I say this: it's not too late
for all of us to build our cities

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:08.224
and nation to make it great again.

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:09.407
It is never too late.

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:10.747
It is never too late.

00:09:11.428 --> 00:09:12.829
You see, after three years

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:16.091
of my four-and-a-half-year
commandship in that district,

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.269
three years in,

00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:19.972
after putting pastors
in the car with my police

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.171
because I knew this --
it's a little secret --

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.354
I knew this:

00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:26.043
it was hard to stay a nasty police officer

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:28.168
while you're riding around
with a clergy.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:30.374
(Laughter)

00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:36.195
(Applause)

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:42.005
You'd be getting in and out of the car,
looking to your right, talking about:

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:45.565
"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,"
all day long -- you can't do it!

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.842
So we came up with some
incredible initiatives,

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:51.361
engagements for our community
and police to build that trust back.

00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:52.944
We began to deal with our youth

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:56.146
and with those who we consider
are on the wrong side of the fence.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.903
We knew we had an economic problem,

00:09:57.927 --> 00:09:59.419
so we began to create jobs.

00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:01.491
We knew there was sickness
in our community

00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:04.009
and they didn't have access
to proper medical care,

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:05.192
so we'd partner up.

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:07.289
We got to that intersection
and partnered up

00:10:07.313 --> 00:10:09.400
with anybody that wanted
to partner with us

00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:11.591
and talked about
what we needed holistically,

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.128
never thinking about the crime.

00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:14.847
Because at the end of the day,

00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:16.934
if we took care
of the needs of the people,

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.521
if we got to the root cause,

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.438
the crime would take care of itself.

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:24.065
It would take care of itself.

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:28.744
(Applause)

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:33.979
And so, after three years
of a four-and-a-half-year stint,

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.341
we looked back and we looked over

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:39.730
and found out that we were
at a 40-year historical low:

00:10:39.754 --> 00:10:42.635
our crime numbers, our homicides --

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:45.116
everything had dropped
down, back to the 1970s.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.556
And it might go back further,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.497
but the problem is, we only
started keeping data since 1970.

00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:52.617
Forty-year crime low, so much so,
I had other commanders call me,

00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:54.058
"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?

00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:56.186
Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.625
(Laughter)

00:10:57.649 --> 00:10:59.308
And so we gave them some of that.

00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:02.420
And in a short period of time,

00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:04.721
the city went to a 30-year crime low.

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:07.830
For the first time in 30 years,
we fell, Baltimore city,

00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:10.218
to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.

00:11:10.242 --> 00:11:11.401
And we celebrated,

00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:15.108
because we had learned
to become great servers,

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.869
become great servers first.

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:19.215
But I gotta tell you this:
these last few years,

00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:22.227
as much as we had learned

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:25.803
to become great proactive police officers

00:11:25.827 --> 00:11:29.588
and great relational police officers
rather than reactive,

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:31.677
these last years have disappointed me.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.052
They have broken my heart.

00:11:34.644 --> 00:11:36.481
The uprising still hurts.

00:11:37.584 --> 00:11:39.270
It still hurts my heart,

00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:42.276
because truly I believe
that it should've never happened.

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:44.807
I believe it should've never happened

00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:47.775
if we were allowed to continue
along the vein that we were in,

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.479
servicing our community,

00:11:49.503 --> 00:11:52.439
treating them like human beings,
treating them with respect,

00:11:52.463 --> 00:11:54.027
loving on them first.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.830
If we continued in that vein,

00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:58.703
it would've never happened.

00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:01.303
But somehow, we went back
to business as usual.

00:12:01.956 --> 00:12:03.450
But I'm excited again!

00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:07.509
I'm excited again, because now
we have a police commissioner

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:10.974
who not only talks
about community policing,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.118
but he absolutely understands it,

00:12:14.142 --> 00:12:16.214
and more importantly, he embraces it.

00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:17.957
So I'm very excited now.

00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:20.930
Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,

00:12:20.954 --> 00:12:25.203
because we, as many cities,
I believe shall rise from the ashes.

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:28.862
I believe -- I truly believe --

00:12:28.886 --> 00:12:29.908
(Applause)

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:31.710
that we will be great again.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.810
I believe,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.541
as we continue to wrap arms
and continue to say,

00:12:37.565 --> 00:12:38.763
"We're in this together,"

00:12:38.787 --> 00:12:40.630
because it's not just an intersection:

00:12:40.654 --> 00:12:44.288
once we meet, we now gotta get
on the same path for the same goals,

00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:46.360
and this city will become great again.

00:12:46.384 --> 00:12:48.345
This nation will become great again.

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.788
Because we have the same goal:
we all want peace.

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.546
We all want respect for one another.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.720
We all want love.

00:12:53.744 --> 00:12:55.636
And I believe we are back on that road,

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.030
and I'm so excited about it.

00:12:57.054 --> 00:13:00.402
So listen, I thank you for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:01.656
God bless you all.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.681
(Applause)

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:03.856
God bless you.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.301
(Applause)
