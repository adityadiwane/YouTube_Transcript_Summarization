00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:14.785
As an Arab female photographer,

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.917
I have always found ample inspiration
for my projects in personal experiences.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.849
The passion I developed for knowledge,

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.250
which allowed me to break barriers
towards a better life

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.599
was the motivation 
for my project I Read I Write.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.331
Pushed by my own experience,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.306
as I was not allowed initially
to pursue my higher education,

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:39.483
I decided to explore and document
stories of other women

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:42.316
who changed their lives through education,

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:46.147
while exposing and questioning
the barriers they face.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:49.833
I covered a range of topics
that concern women's education,

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.451
keeping in mind the differences
among Arab countries

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.569
due to economic and social factors.

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.734
These issues include female illiteracy,
which is quite high in the region;

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:04.141
educational reforms;
programs for dropout students;

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.200
and political activism
among university students.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.512
As I started this work,

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:13.072
it was not always easy 
to convince the women to participate.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.987
Only after explaining to them

00:01:14.987 --> 00:01:17.841
how their stories
might influence other women's lives,

00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:22.647
how they would become role models
for their own community, did some agree.

00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:25.828
Seeking a collaborative
and reflexive approach,

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:29.032
I asked them to write
their own words and ideas

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:31.261
on prints of their own images.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.071
Those images were then shared
in some of the classrooms,

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.321
and worked to inspire
and motivate other women

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.416
going through similar educations 
and situations.

00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:45.100
Aisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.234
"I sought education in order
to be independent

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.533
and to not count on men with everything."

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:55.358
One of my first subjects
was Umm El-Saad from Egypt.

00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:58.799
When we first met, she was
barely able to write her name.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.051
She was attending
a nine-month literacy program

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.000
run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.229
Months later, she was joking
that her husband

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.760
had threatened to pull her
out of the classes,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.989
as he found out that his now literate wife

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.777
was going through his phone text messages.

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:15.237
(Laughter)

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:16.985
Naughty Umm El-Saad.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:21.139
Of course, that's not why
Umm El-Saad joined the program.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.855
I saw how she was longing to gain
control over her simple daily routines,

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:27.764
small details that we take for granted,

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.962
from counting money at the market
to helping her kids in homework.

00:02:31.962 --> 00:02:34.957
Despite her poverty
and her community's mindset,

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:37.042
which belittles women's education,

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:39.768
Umm El-Saad, along with
her Egyptian classmates,

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:42.995
was eager to learn how to read and write.

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:46.729
In Tunisia, I met Asma,

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.771
one of the four activist women
I interviewed.

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.153
The secular bioengineering student
is quite active on social media.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:59.917
Regarding her country, which treasured
what has been called the Arab Spring,

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.843
she said, "I've always dreamt
of discovering a new bacteria.

00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:06.603
Now, after the revolution,
we have a new one every single day."

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:11.179
Asma was referring to the rise
of religious fundamentalism in the region,

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.253
which is another obstacle
to women in particular.

00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:20.229
Out of all the women I met,
Fayza from Yemen affected me the most.

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:25.114
Fayza was forced to drop out of school
at the age of eight when she was married.

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:28.361
That marriage lasted for a year.

00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.229
At 14, she became the third wife
of a 60-year-old man,

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.919
and by the time she was 18,
she was a divorced mother of three.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.390
Despite her poverty,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.660
despite her social status as a divorcÃ©e
in an ultra-conservative society,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.538
and despite the opposition of her parents
to her going back to school,

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:53.710
Fayza knew that her only way
to control her life was through education.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.480
She is now 26.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.640
She received a grant from a local NGO

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.519
to fund her business studies
at the university.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.979
Her goal is to find a job,
rent a place to live in,

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.998
and bring her kids back with her.

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:11.455
The Arab states are going through
tremendous change,

00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:14.216
and the struggles women face
are overwhelming.

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:16.458
Just like the women I photographed,

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:20.890
I had to overcome many barriers
to becoming the photographer I am today,

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.637
many people along the way
telling me what I can and cannot do.

00:04:25.387 --> 00:04:30.693
Umm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza,
and many women across the Arab world,

00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:34.651
show that it is possible
to overcome barriers to education,

00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:37.920
which they know is the best means
to a better future.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.197
And here I would like to end
with a quote by Yasmine,

00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:45.463
one of the four activist women
I interviewed in Tunisia.

00:04:45.463 --> 00:04:47.034
Yasmine wrote,

00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:49.414
"Question your convictions.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:53.156
Be who you to want to be,
not who they want you to be.

00:04:53.156 --> 00:04:56.732
Don't accept their enslavement,
for your mother birthed you free."

00:04:56.732 --> 00:04:58.961
Thank you.

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:03.026
(Applause)
