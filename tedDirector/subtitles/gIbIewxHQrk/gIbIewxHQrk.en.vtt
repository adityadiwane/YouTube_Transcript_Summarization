00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:16.553
I moved back home 15 years ago

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:19.417
after a 20-year stay in the United States,

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.781
and Africa called me back.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:25.322
And I founded my country's first

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.633
graphic design and new media college.

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:32.559
And I called it the Zimbabwe
Institute of Vigital Arts.

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:36.796
The idea, the dream, was really
for a sort of Bauhaus

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.402
sort of school where new
ideas were interrogated

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:44.615
and investigated,

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:47.375
the creation of a new visual language

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.356
based on the African creative heritage.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.781
We offer a two-year diploma

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.545
to talented students who have
successfully completed

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.725
their high school education.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.662
And typography's a very important
part of the curriculum

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:09.605
and we encourage our students
to look inward for influence.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.971
Here's a poster designed
by one of the students

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:16.128
under the theme "Education is a right."

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:20.411
Some logos designed by my students.

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:24.479
Africa has had a long
tradition of writing,

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:26.651
but this is not such a well-known fact,

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:30.584
and I wrote the book "Afrikan
Alphabets" to address that.

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:34.131
The different types of writing in Africa,

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.376
first was proto-writing,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.544
as illustrated by Nsibidi,

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:41.616
which is the writing
system of a secret society

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.446
of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.316
So it's a special-interest writing system.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.891
The Akan of people of Ghana
and [Cote d'Ivoire]

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:56.936
developed Adinkra symbols
some 400 years ago,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.804
and these are proverbs,
historical sayings,

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:03.514
objects, animals, plants,

00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:05.522
and my favorite Adinkra system

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:07.898
is the first one at the top on the left.

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:08.900
It's called Sankofa.

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:14.894
It means, "Return and get
it." Learn from the past.

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:17.695
This pictograph by the Jokwe
people of Angola

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.514
tells the story
of the creation of the world.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:26.918
At the top is God,
at the bottom is man, mankind,

00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:31.826
and on the left is the sun,
on the right is the moon.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.681
All the paths lead to and from God.

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:40.075
These secret societies
of the Yoruba, Kongo

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.270
and Palo religions

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:46.007
in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:49.931
developed this intricate writing system

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:53.700
which is alive and well
today in the New World

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:59.888
in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:03.184
In the rainforests of the Democratic
Republic of Congo,

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:06.075
in the Ituri society,

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.846
the men pound out a cloth
out of a special tree,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.939
and the women, who are also
the praise singers,

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.620
paint interweaving patterns

00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:18.350
that are the same in structure

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:23.005
as the polyphonic structures
that they use in their singing --

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.993
a sort of a musical score, if you may.

00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:29.742
In South Africa, Ndebele women

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:33.100
use these symbols and other
geometric patterns

00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:36.914
to paint their homes in bright colors,

00:03:36.938 --> 00:03:39.836
and the Zulu women use the symbols

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.334
in the beads that they weave

00:03:41.358 --> 00:03:44.477
into bracelets and necklaces.

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.556
Ethiopia has had the longest
tradition of writing,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.875
with the Ethiopic script
that was developed

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.837
in the fourth century A.D.

00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:55.351
and is used to write Amharic,

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.636
which is spoken by over 24 million people.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.093
King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum
Kingdom of Cameroon

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.658
developed Shü-mom at the age of 25.

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.745
Shü-mom is a writing system.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.738
It's a syllabary. It's not
exactly an alphabet.

00:04:11.762 --> 00:04:15.053
And here we see
three stages of development

00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:19.692
that it went through in 30 years.

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:25.252
The Vai people of Liberia had
a long tradition of literacy

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:29.187
before their first contact
with Europeans in the 1800s.

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:33.769
It's a syllabary and reads
from left to right.

00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:37.340
Next door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende

00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.363
also developed a syllabary,

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:42.995
but theirs reads from right to left.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:46.385
Africa has had a long tradition of design,

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.008
a well-defined design sensibility,

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:52.310
but the problem in Africa has been that,

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.008
especially today, designers in Africa

00:04:55.032 --> 00:04:57.542
struggle with all forms of design

00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:02.048
because they are more apt to look outward

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:04.676
for influence and inspiration.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.873
The creative spirit in Africa,
the creative tradition,

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:11.749
is as potent as it has always been,

00:05:11.773 --> 00:05:15.796
if only designers could look within.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.687
This Ethiopic cross illustrates

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:21.467
what Dr. Ron Eglash has established:

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.356
that Africa has a lot
to contribute to computing

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.732
and mathematics through their intuitive
grasp of fractals.

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:34.799
Africans of antiquity
created civilization,

00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:38.112
and their monuments,
which still stand today,

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:41.696
are a true testimony of their greatness.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.614
Most probably,
one of humanity's greatest achievements

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:48.580
is the invention of the alphabet,

00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:51.698
and that has been attributed
to Mesopotamia

00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:57.263
with their invention
of cuneiform in 1600 BC,

00:05:57.287 --> 00:06:01.001
followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:06.470
and that story has been cast
in stone as historical fact.

00:06:06.494 --> 00:06:09.184
That is, until 1998,

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:14.303
when one Yale professor
John Coleman Darnell

00:06:14.327 --> 00:06:17.693
discovered these inscriptions
in the Thebes desert

00:06:17.717 --> 00:06:21.053
on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,

00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:27.289
and these have been dated
at between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,

00:06:27.313 --> 00:06:30.298
centuries before Mesopotamia.

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:33.226
Called Wadi el-Hol

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.432
because of the place
that they were discovered,

00:06:36.456 --> 00:06:39.837
these inscriptions --
research is still going on,

00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.635
a few of them have been deciphered,

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.142
but there is consensus among scholars

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:50.359
that this is really
humanity's first alphabet.

00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:53.403
Over here, you see a paleographic chart

00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:56.520
that shows what has
been deciphered so far,

00:06:56.544 --> 00:06:59.929
starting with the letter
A, "ālep," at the top,

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:03.614
and "bêt," in the middle, and so forth.

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.227
It is time that students
of design in Africa

00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.444
read the works of titans
like Cheikh Anta Diop,

00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:13.560
Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop,

00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:16.643
whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.776
by this discovery.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.863
The last word goes
to the great Jamaican leader

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:24.852
Marcus Mosiah Garvey

00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:28.052
and the Akan people of Ghana

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:30.425
with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa,

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.667
which encourages us to go to the past

00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.839
so as to inform our present

00:07:34.863 --> 00:07:39.441
and build on a future
for us and our children.

00:07:39.465 --> 00:07:43.682
It is also time that designers in Africa

00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:46.308
stop looking outside.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.698
They've been looking
outward for a long time,

00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:51.010
yet what they were looking for

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:55.963
has been right there
within grasp, right within them.

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:57.767
Thank you very much.

00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:02.730
(Applause)
