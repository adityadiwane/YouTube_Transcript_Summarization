00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.348
I'm going to talk to you tonight

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.044
about coming out of the closet,

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:17.256
and not in the traditional sense,

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:19.568
not just the gay closet.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.622
I think we all have closets.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.514
Your closet may be telling someone

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:25.736
you love her for the first time,

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.882
or telling someone that you're pregnant,

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.414
or telling someone you have cancer,

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:32.445
or any of the other hard conversations

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.711
we have throughout our lives.

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.381
All a closet is is a hard conversation,

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:41.435
and although our topics may vary tremendously,

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:43.107
the experience of being in

00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:46.438
and coming out of the closet is universal.

00:00:46.438 --> 00:00:52.030
It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.399
Several years ago,

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.170
I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.241
a local diner in town,

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.956
and during my time there I would go through phases

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:05.521
of militant lesbian intensity:

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.296
not shaving my armpits,

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:10.845
quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.100
And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.800
and how recently I had shaved my head,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.327
the question would often be sprung on me,

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.410
usually by a little kid:

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.577
"Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:27.249
And there would be an awkward silence at the table.

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.672
I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:32.791
hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.628
The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.946
and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.

00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:39.650
But I would say nothing,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.886
and I would seethe inside.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.534
And it got to the point where every time I walked up

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:47.562
to a table that had a kid anywhere between
three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:49.008
(Laughter)

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.256
And that is a terrible feeling.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:55.104
So I promised myself, the next
time, I would say something.

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:57.472
I would have that hard conversation.

00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:00.023
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:02.795
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.948
Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:09.899
and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.237
on this table. (Laughter)

00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:14.737
I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.

00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:16.535
I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.833
I've even got this little bit from
"Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.428
So I take a deep breath and I look down

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:27.807
and staring back at me is a
four-year-old girl in a pink dress,

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:29.852
not a challenge to a feminist duel,

00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:32.412
just a kid with a question:

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:34.783
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"

00:02:34.783 --> 00:02:36.428
So I take another deep breath,

00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:37.795
squat down to next to her, and say,

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.917
"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:41.679
My hair is short like a boy's,

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.711
and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:45.678
and you know how sometimes
you like to wear a pink dress,

00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:48.334
and sometimes you like to
wear your comfy jammies?

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.026
Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:54.114
And this kid looks me dead in the eye,

00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:55.745
without missing a beat, and says,

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:57.697
"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.

00:02:57.697 --> 00:02:59.588
Can I get a pancake, please?"

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:02.309
(Laughter)

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.775
And that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.018
How about that pancake?"

00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:10.500
It was the easiest hard conversation

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.892
I have ever had.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.554
And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:18.915
we were both real with each other.

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:20.691
So like many of us,

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.028
I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:25.642
most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.666
But inside, in the dark,

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.834
you can't tell what color the walls are.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.244
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.

00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:36.995
So really, my closet is no different than yours

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.820
or yours or yours.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.564
Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.895
why coming out of my closet was
harder than coming out of yours,

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:46.097
but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.

00:03:46.097 --> 00:03:48.090
Hard is hard.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.233
Who can tell me that explaining to
someone you've just declared bankruptcy

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:54.472
is harder than telling someone
you just cheated on them?

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:57.059
Who can tell me that his coming out story

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.928
is harder than telling your five-year-old 
you're getting a divorce?

00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:03.275
There is no harder, there is just hard.

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:06.813
We need to stop ranking our hard
against everyone else's hard

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.212
to make us feel better or worse about our closets

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:13.275
and just commiserate on the 
fact that we all have hard.

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:16.611
At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:18.541
and they may feel safe,

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:21.488
or at least safer than what lies
on the other side of that door.

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:23.253
But I am here to tell you,

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:25.378
no matter what your walls are made of,

00:04:25.378 --> 00:04:29.946
a closet is no place for a person to live.

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.106
Thanks. (Applause)

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:36.334
So imagine yourself 20 years ago.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:41.142
Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,

00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:43.100
and high-heeled shoes.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.995
I was not the militant lesbian

00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:48.934
ready to fight any four-year-old
that walked into the cafe.

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.623
I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner

00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:54.887
of my pitch-black closet

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:57.142
clutching my gay grenade,

00:04:57.142 --> 00:05:00.774
and moving one muscle is the scariest thing

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.087
I have ever done.

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:05.303
My family, my friends, complete strangers --

00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:06.745
I had spent my entire life

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:08.369
trying to not disappoint these people,

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.985
and now I was turning the world upside down

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.609
on purpose.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:15.727
I was burning the pages of the script

00:05:15.727 --> 00:05:17.954
we had all followed for so long,

00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:21.597
but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.

00:05:21.597 --> 00:05:23.475
One of my most memorable grenade tosses

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:25.636
was at my sister's wedding.

00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:27.546
(Laughter)

00:05:27.546 --> 00:05:30.241
It was the first time that many in attendance

00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.412
knew I was gay, so in doing 
my maid of honor duties,

00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:35.528
in my black dress and heels,

00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:37.333
I walked around to tables

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.502
and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,

00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:42.670
folks that had known me for years.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.781
And after a little small talk,
one of the women shouted out,

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:48.283
"I love Nathan Lane!"

00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:51.371
And the battle of gay relatability had begun.

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:53.218
"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:55.850
"Well, yeah, actually, we have
friends in San Francisco."

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.385
"Well, we've never been there
but we've heard it's fabulous."

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:00.246
"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?

00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:03.395
He's really good and he has
never talked about a girlfriend."

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:05.033
"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.168
Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will &amp; Grace.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.771
And you know who we love? Jack.

00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:10.596
Jack is our favorite."

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:13.188
And then one woman, stumped

00:06:13.188 --> 00:06:15.676
but wanting so desperately to show her support,

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.050
to let me know she was on my side,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.930
she finally blurted out,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.276
"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:25.839
(Laughter)

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.918
And I had a choice in that moment,

00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:29.846
as all grenade throwers do.

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:33.286
I could go back to my girlfriend
and my gay-loving table

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.185
and mock their responses,

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:37.559
chastise their unworldliness and their inability

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:40.468
to jump through the politically correct 
gay hoops I had brought with me,

00:06:40.477 --> 00:06:43.345
or I could empathize with them

00:06:43.345 --> 00:06:47.062
and realize that that was maybe one of
the hardest things they had ever done,

00:06:47.062 --> 00:06:50.458
that starting and having that conversation

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:52.827
was them coming out of their closets.

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:56.111
Sure, it would have been easy
to point out where they felt short.

00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.366
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.658
and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.

00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:05.503
And what else can you ask someone to do but try?

00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:07.576
If you're going to be real with someone,

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:11.146
you gotta be ready for real in return.

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:14.545
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.566
Ask anybody I have ever dated.

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:19.794
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:21.431
the three Pancake Girl principles.

00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:25.203
Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,

00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:28.379
but know what it takes to come out of any closet

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.338
is essentially the same.

00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:33.018
Number one: Be authentic.

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:34.732
Take the armor off. Be yourself.

00:07:34.732 --> 00:07:36.468
That kid in the cafe had no armor,

00:07:36.468 --> 00:07:38.764
but I was ready for battle.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.353
If you want someone to be real with you,

00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:44.337
they need to know that you bleed too.

00:07:44.337 --> 00:07:47.347
Number two: Be direct. Just
say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:50.083
If you know you are gay, just say it.

00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:51.951
If you tell your parents you might be gay,

00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.593
they will hold out hope that this will change.

00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:56.502
Do not give them that sense of false hope.

00:07:56.502 --> 00:07:58.455
(Laughter)

00:07:58.455 --> 00:08:03.062
And number three, and most important --

00:08:03.062 --> 00:08:05.386
(Laughter)

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:09.117
Be unapologetic.

00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:11.182
You are speaking your truth.

00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:15.079
Never apologize for that.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:17.501
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,

00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.439
so sure, apologize for what you've done,

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:23.943
but never apologize for who you are.

00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:26.687
And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,

00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:29.447
but that is on them, not on you.

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.919
Those are their expectations
of who you are, not yours.

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:36.140
That is their story, not yours.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.926
The only story that matters

00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:40.642
is the one that you want to write.

00:08:40.642 --> 00:08:42.485
So the next time you find yourself

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:44.705
in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:48.027
know we have all been there before.

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:51.205
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:54.923
And we know it's hard but we need you out here,

00:08:54.923 --> 00:08:57.604
no matter what your walls are made of,

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.618
because I guarantee you there are others

00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:01.545
peering through the keyholes of their closets

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:05.677
looking for the next brave soul to
bust a door open, so be that person

00:09:05.677 --> 00:09:08.707
and show the world that we
are bigger than our closets

00:09:08.707 --> 00:09:12.099
and that a closet is no place for a person

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:13.839
to truly live.

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:17.111
Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)
