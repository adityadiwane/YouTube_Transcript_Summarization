00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.532
I'm Michael Shermer,
director of the Skeptics Society,

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:29.088
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.025
We investigate claims of the paranormal,

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:34.731
pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,
and claims of all kinds between,

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.649
science and pseudo-science
and non-science and junk science,

00:00:37.673 --> 00:00:40.976
voodoo science, pathological science,
bad science, non-science,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.887
and plain old non-sense.

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.828
And unless you've been on Mars recently,

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:46.870
you know there's a lot of that out there.

00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:49.916
Some people call us debunkers,
which is kind of a negative term.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.048
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:55.525
We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there --

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.976
well, we're sort of like
the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.230
(Laughter)

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:02.976
trying to replace bad ideas
with good ideas.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.863
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.045
I brought this with me,

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:09.976
this was given to us
by NBC Dateline to test.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.286
It's produced by the Quadro
Corporation of West Virginia.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.220
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:17.690
(Laughter)

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:22.976
This was being sold to high-school
administrators for $900 apiece.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.327
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio
Shack antenna attached to it.

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.317
You could dowse for all sorts of things,

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.734
but this particular one was built
to dowse for marijuana

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:33.976
in students' lockers.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.460
(Laughter)

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:40.029
So the way it works
is you go down the hallway,

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:43.052
and you see if it tilts
toward a particular locker,

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.520
and then you open the locker.

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:46.121
So it looks something like this.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.328
I'll show you.

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:49.976
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.391
Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:56.220
Well, this is science,
so we'll do a controlled experiment.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:57.826
It'll go this way for sure.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.784
(Laughter)

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:04.334
Sir, do you want to empty
your pockets, please, sir?

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.196
(Laughter)

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.677
So the question was, can it actually
find marijuana in students' lockers?

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.299
And the answer is,
if you open enough of them, yes.

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:13.346
(Laughter)

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.976
(Applause)

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.381
But in science, we have to keep track
of the misses, not just the hits.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.671
And that's probably the key lesson
to my short talk here:

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:25.429
This is how psychics work, astrologers,
tarot card readers and so on.

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.672
People remember the hits
and forget the misses.

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:29.591
In science, we keep the whole database,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.276
and look to see if the number
of hits somehow stands out

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.513
from the total number
you'd expect by chance.

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:35.831
In this case, we tested it.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.347
We had two opaque boxes:

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.005
one with government-approved THC
marijuana, and one with nothing.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.910
And it got it 50 percent of the time --

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.027
(Laughter)

00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:46.976
which is exactly what you'd expect
with a coin-flip model.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.991
So that's just a fun little example
here of the sorts of things we do.

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:54.483
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.
Each one has a particular theme.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.581
This one is on the future of intelligence.

00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:58.376
Are people getting smarter or dumber?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.448
I have an opinion of this myself
because of the business I'm in,

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.139
but in fact, people, it turns out,
are getting smarter.

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:06.976
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.651
Sort of an interesting thing.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.222
With science, don't think of skepticism
as a thing, or science as a thing.

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:13.976
Are science and religion compatible?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.231
It's like, are science
and plumbing compatible?

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:17.889
They're just two different things.

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:19.652
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:21.398
It's a way of thinking about things.

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:24.492
It's a way of looking for natural
explanations for all phenomena.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:25.866
I mean, what's more likely:

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.453
that extraterrestrial intelligences
or multi-dimensional beings

00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:31.867
travel across vast distances
of interstellar space

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:35.071
to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's
field in Puckerbrush, Kansas

00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:36.905
to promote skeptic.com, our web page?

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:41.407
Or is it more likely that a reader
of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?

00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:43.081
And in all cases we have to ask --

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.929
(Laughter)

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:46.976
What's the more likely explanation?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.167
Before we say something
is out of this world,

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.855
we should first make sure
that it's not in this world.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.030
What's more likely:

00:03:53.054 --> 00:03:56.380
that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
in his run for the governorship,

00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.902
or that the "World Weekly News"
makes stuff up?

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.315
(Laughter)

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:05.001
The same theme is expressed nicely
here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:08.240
For those of you in the back,
it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:10.976
I think you need to be more
explicit here in step two."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.496
This single slide completely dismantles
the intelligent design arguments.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.368
There's nothing more to it than that.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:18.442
(Applause)

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.854
You can say a miracle occurs,

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:22.844
it's just that it doesn't explain
anything or offer anything.

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:24.018
There's nothing to test.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:27.490
It's the end of the conversation
for intelligent design creationists.

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:32.400
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw
terms out as linguistic place fillers --

00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:34.772
dark energy or dark matter,
something like that --

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:37.256
until we figure out what it is,
we'll call it this.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.981
It's the beginning of the causal
chain for science.

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:44.080
For intelligent design creationists,
it's the end of the chain.

00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:46.276
So again, we can ask this:
what's more likely?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.691
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual
cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:53.976
This is a UFO shot from my house
in Altadena, California,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.976
looking down over Pasadena.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.521
And if it looks a lot like a Buick
hubcap, it's because it is.

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:02.283
You don't even need Photoshop
or high-tech equipment,

00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:03.505
you don't need computers.

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.976
This was shot with a throwaway
Kodak Instamatic camera.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.096
You just have somebody off on the side
with a hubcap ready to go.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.018
Camera's ready -- that's it.

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:13.479
(Laughter)

00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:16.976
So, although it's possible
that most of these things are fake

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.714
or illusions or so on,
and that some of them are real,

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:23.871
it's more likely that all of them
are fake, like the crop circles.

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:27.276
On a more serious note, in all of science
we're looking for a balance

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.976
between data and theory.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.976
In the case of Galileo,
he had two problems

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.361
when he turned his telescope to Saturn.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.507
First of all, there was no
theory of planetary rings.

00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:40.724
Second of all, his data
was grainy and fuzzy,

00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:43.276
and he couldn't quite make out
what he was looking at.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.976
So he wrote that he had seen --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.507
"I have observed that the furthest
planet has three bodies."

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:51.396
And this is what he ended up
concluding that he saw.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.976
So without a theory of planetary
rings and with only grainy data,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.918
you can't have a good theory.

00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:58.561
It wasn't solved until 1655.

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.599
This is Christiaan Huygens's book
that catalogs all the mistakes

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:04.585
people made trying to figure out
what was going on with Saturn.

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:06.465
It wasn't till Huygens had two things:

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:10.975
He had a good theory of planetary rings
and how the solar system operated,

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.862
and he had better telescopic,
more fine-grain data

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:17.429
in which he could figure out that
as the Earth is going around faster --

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:20.681
according to Kepler's Laws --
than Saturn, then we catch up with it.

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:23.976
And we see the angles of the rings
at different angles, there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.220
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:31.541
The problem with having a theory is that
it may be loaded with cognitive biases.

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:34.832
So one of the problems of explaining
why people believe weird things

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.924
is that we have things, on a simple level,

00:06:36.948 --> 00:06:38.776
and then I'll go to more serious ones.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.676
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.476
This is the face on Mars.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.012
In 1976, where there was a whole movement
to get NASA to photograph that area

00:06:47.036 --> 00:06:50.952
because people thought this was monumental
architecture made by Martians.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.747
Here's the close-up of it from 2001.

00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:56.231
If you squint, you can still see the face.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:57.557
And when you're squinting,

00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:00.604
you're turning that from fine-grain
to coarse-grain,

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.915
so you're reducing
the quality of your data.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.168
And if I didn't tell you what to look for,
you'd still see the face,

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.621
because we're programmed
by evolution to see faces.

00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:10.796
Faces are important for us socially.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.288
And of course, happy faces,
faces of all kinds are easy to see.

00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:16.208
You see the happy face on Mars, there.

00:07:16.232 --> 00:07:17.383
(Laughter)

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:20.320
If astronomers were frogs,
perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.

00:07:20.344 --> 00:07:22.297
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.

00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:24.883
Or if geologists were elephants?

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:28.976
Religious iconography.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.801
(Laughter)

00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:33.976
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.477
He charged five bucks a head
to come see the nun bun

00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:40.214
till he got a cease-and-desist
from Mother Teresa's lawyer.

00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:43.976
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.604
or is it up the street from here?

00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:48.976
Tree bark is particularly good
because it's nice and grainy, branchy,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
black-and-white splotchy and you can
get the pattern-seeking --

00:07:52.024 --> 00:07:53.976
humans are pattern-seeking animals.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.563
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side
of a glass window in Sao Paulo.

00:07:57.587 --> 00:08:01.001
Here's when the Virgin Mary made
her appearance on a cheese sandwich --

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:03.515
which I got to actually
hold in a Las Vegas casino --

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.076
of course, this being America.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.625
(Laughter)

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:10.976
This casino paid $28,500
on eBay for the cheese sandwich.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.976
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.381
But who does it really look like?
The Virgin Mary?

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:17.384
(Laughter)

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:21.273
It has that sort of
puckered lips, 1940s-era look.

00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:22.976
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.976
I actually went to see this one.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.834
There was a lot of people there.

00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:31.510
The faithful come in their wheelchairs
and crutches, and so on.

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:33.395
We went down and investigated.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.592
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins,
me and The Amazing Randi,

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.029
next to this two,
two and a half story-sized image.

00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:42.555
All these candles, thousands of candles
people had lit in tribute to this.

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:45.384
So we walked around the backside,
to see what was going on.

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:48.739
It turns out wherever there's
a sprinkler head and a palm tree,

00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:49.976
you get the effect.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.381
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside,
which they started to wipe off.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:55.976
I guess you can only have
one miracle per building.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.333
(Laughter)

00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:03.036
So is it really a miracle of Mary,
or is it a miracle of Marge?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.061
(Laughter)

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.688
And now I'm going to finish up
with another example of this,

00:09:07.712 --> 00:09:10.489
with auditory illusions.

00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:13.039
There's this film, "White Noise,"
with Michael Keaton,

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:15.597
about the dead talking back to us.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:19.286
By the way, the whole business of talking
to the dead is not that big a deal.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.795
Anybody can do it, turns out.

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:23.907
It's getting the dead to talk
back that's the really hard part.

00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:25.029
(Laughter)

00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:28.835
In this case, supposedly, these messages
are hidden in electronic phenomena.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:32.144
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page
where I downloaded this stuff.

00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:35.319
This is the most famous one
of all of these.

00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:38.144
Here's the forward version
of the very famous song.

00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.239
(Music with lyrics)

00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:44.421
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now.

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:48.884
It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen.

00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:55.751
Yes, there are two paths you
can go by, but in the long run,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.434
There's still time to change
the road you're on.

00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:03.094
(Music ends)

00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:06.344
Couldn't you just listen to that all day?

00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:07.975
All right, here it is backwards,

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:12.029
and see if you can hear the hidden
messages that are supposedly in there.

00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:19.291
(Music with unintelligible lyrics)

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.744
(Lyrics) Satan!

00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:34.245
(Unintelligible lyrics continue)

00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:43.554
What did you get?
Audience: Satan!

00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:45.290
Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan".

00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:47.616
Now, I'll prime the auditory
part of your brain

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.077
to tell you what you're supposed
to hear, and then hear it again.

00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.902
(Music with lyrics)

00:11:17.673 --> 00:11:18.759
(Music ends)

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:19.990
(Laughter)

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:26.403
(Applause)

00:11:26.427 --> 00:11:28.976
You can't miss it
when I tell you what's there.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.250
(Laughter)

00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:36.309
I'm going to just end
with a positive, nice little story.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.178
The Skeptics is a nonprofit
educational organization.

00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:42.022
We're always looking for little
good things that people do.

00:11:42.046 --> 00:11:44.055
And in England, there's a pop singer.

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:47.824
One of the top popular singers
in England today, Katie Melua.

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.376
And she wrote a beautiful song.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.976
It was in the top five in 2005, called,
"Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.096
It's a love story -- she's sort
of the Norah Jones of the UK --

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.741
about how she much loves her guy,

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:02.241
and compared to nine million
bicycles, and so forth.

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:04.490
And she has this one passage here.

00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:05.550
(Music)

00:12:05.574 --> 00:12:11.345
(Lyrics) We are 12 billion
light-years from the edge

00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:13.694
That's a guess,

00:12:13.718 --> 00:12:17.429
No one can ever say it's true,

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:22.056
But I know that I will always be with you.

00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:25.696
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
At least she got it close.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.643
In America it'd be,
"We're 6,000 light years from the edge."

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:29.703
(Laughter)

00:12:29.727 --> 00:12:33.496
But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle
physicist now turned science educator,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.647
who wrote the book
"The Big Bang," and so on,

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.076
uses every chance he gets
to promote good science.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.386
And so he wrote an op-ed piece
in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.446
in which he said, well, we know exactly
how far from the edge.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.288
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years,
and it's not a guess.

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:54.576
We know within precise
error bars how close it is.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.410
So we can say, although not absolutely
true, it's pretty close to being true.

00:12:58.434 --> 00:13:03.173
And, to his credit, Katie called him up
after this op-ed piece came out, and said,

00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:05.568
"I'm so embarrassed.
I was in the astronomy club.

00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:06.870
I should've known better."

00:13:06.894 --> 00:13:08.116
And she re-cut the song.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.988
So I will end with the new version.

00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:11.276
(Music with lyrics)

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.721
We are 13.7 billion light years

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:17.236
from the edge of the observable universe.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.029
That's a good estimate
with well-defined error bars.

00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:24.205
And with the available information,

00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:28.572
I predict that I will always be with you.

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:29.753
(Laughter)

00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:30.945
How cool is that?

00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:33.000
(Applause)
