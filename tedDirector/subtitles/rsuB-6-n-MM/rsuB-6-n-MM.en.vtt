00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Why can't we solve these problems?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
We know what they are.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Something always seems to stop us.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Why?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I remember March the 15th, 2000.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
In the newspaper it said

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
"it was all part of a normal process."

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
A little bit further on in the article

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
it said "a loss that would normally take

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.260
the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
That same word, "normal,"

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
had two different,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
almost opposite meanings.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
If we walk into the B15 iceberg

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
when we leave here today,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we're going to bump into something

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
a thousand feet tall,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
76 miles long,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
17 miles wide,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and it's going to weigh two gigatons.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And yet I think it's this perspective of us

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
as humans to look at our world

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
through the lens of normal

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
is one of the forces

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that stops us developing real solutions.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Only 90 days after this,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
arguably the greatest discovery

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
of the last century occurred.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
It was the sequencing for the first time

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
of the human genome.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
This is the code that's in every single one

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
of our 50 trillion cells

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
that makes us who we are and what we are.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And if we just take one cell's worth

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of this code and unwind it,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
it's a meter long,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
two nanometers thick.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And I wondered,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
what if the answer to some of our biggest problems

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
could be found in the smallest of places,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
where the difference between what is

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
valuable and what is worthless

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
is merely the addition or subtraction

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
of a few atoms?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And what

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
if we could get exquisite control

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
over the essence of energy,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
the electron?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So I started to go around the world

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
finding the best and brightest scientists

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I could at universities

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
whose collective discoveries have the chance

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
to take us there,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and we formed a company to build

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
on their extraordinary ideas.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Six and a half years later,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
a hundred and eighty researchers,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
they have some amazing developments

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in the lab,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and I will show you three of those today,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
such that we can stop burning up our planet

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and instead,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
we can generate all the energy we need

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
right where we are,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
cleanly, safely, and cheaply.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Think of the space that we spend

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
most of our time.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
A tremendous amount of energy

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
is coming at us from the sun.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
We like the light that comes into the room,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
but in the middle of summer,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
all that heat is coming into the room

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that we're trying to keep cool.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260
We're trying to heat up

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
the space that we're in,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and all that is trying to get out through the window.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Wouldn't it be really great

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
if the window could flick back the heat

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
into the room if we needed it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
or flick it away before it came in?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
One of the materials that can do this

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
is a remarkable material, carbon,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.260
where graphite is blasted by a vapor,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and when the vaporized carbon condenses,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
it condenses back into a different form:

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
chickenwire rolled up.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
But this chickenwire carbon,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
called a carbon nanotube,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is a hundred thousand times smaller

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
than the width of one of your hairs.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It's a thousand times

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
more conductive than copper.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
How is that possible?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.260
One of the things about working at the nanoscale

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
is things look and act very differently.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
You think of carbon as black.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Carbon at the nanoscale

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
is actually transparent

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and flexible.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And when it's in this form,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
if I combine it with a polymer

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and affix it to your window

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
when it's in its colored state,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it will reflect away all heat and light,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and when it's in its bleached state

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
it will let all the light and heat through

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and any combination in between.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
To change its state, by the way,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And once you've changed its state, it stays there

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
until you change its state again.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
As we were working on this incredible

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
discovery at University of Florida,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
we were told to go down the corridor

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
to visit another scientist,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and he was working

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
on a pretty incredible thing.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Imagine

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
if we didn't have to rely

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.260
on artificial lighting to get around at night.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
We'd have to see at night, right?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
This lets you do it.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
a detector and an imager.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
The total width of it

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
is 600 times smaller

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
than the width of a decimal place.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And it takes all the infrared available at night,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
converts it into an electron

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
in the space of two small films,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and is enabling you to play an image

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
which you can see through.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I'm going to show to TEDsters,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the first time, this operating.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Firstly I'm going to show you

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
the transparency.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Transparency is key.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's a film that you can look through.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And then I'm going to turn the lights out.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And you can see, off a tiny film,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.260
incredible clarity.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
As we were working on this, it dawned on us:

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and converting it into electrons.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.260
What if we combined it

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
with this?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Suddenly you've converted energy

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.260
into an electron on a plastic surface

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that you can stick on your window.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But because it's flexible,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.260
it can be on any surface whatsoever.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
The power plant of tomorrow

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.260
is no power plant.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
We talked about generating and using.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
We want to talk about storing energy,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and unfortunately

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
the best thing we've got going

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
is something that was developed in France

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
a hundred and fifty years ago,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
the lead acid battery.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
In terms of dollars per what's stored,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
it's simply the best.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
these in our basements to store our power,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and we gave them this diagram.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It was in actually a diner

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
We said, "Could you build this?"

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And these scientists,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And what they built was eBox.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
EBox is testing new nanomaterials

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to park an electron on the outside,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
hold it until you need it,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and then be able to release it and pass it off.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Being able to do that means

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that I can generate energy

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
cleanly, efficiently and cheaply

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
right where I am.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
It's my energy.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And if I don't need it, I can convert it

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
back up on the window

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
to energy, light, and beam it,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
line of site, to your place.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And for that I do not need

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
an electric grid between us.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
The grid of tomorrow is no grid,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and energy, clean efficient energy,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
will one day be free.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260
If you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
which is water.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Each of us, every day,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.260
need just eight glasses of this,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
because we're human.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
When we run out of water,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
as we are in some parts of the world

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and soon to be in other parts of the world,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
we're going to have to get this from the sea,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
These also require tremendous amounts of energy.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
supply of oil to run the pumps

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
to generate the water.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
We're simply not going to do that.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
But in a world where energy is freed

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and transmittable

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
easily and cheaply, we can take any water

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
wherever we are

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and turn it into whatever we need.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
I'm glad to be working with

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
incredibly brilliant and kind scientists,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
no kinder than

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
many of the people in the world,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
but they have a magic look at the world.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And I'm glad to see their discoveries

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
coming out of the lab and into the world.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.260
It's been a long time in coming for me.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
18 years ago,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
I saw a photograph in the paper.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
It was taken by Kevin Carter

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
who went to the Sudan

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
to document their famine there.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I've carried this photograph with me

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
every day since then.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.260
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.260
By any standard this is wrong.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
It's just wrong.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
We can do better than this.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
We should do better than this.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And whenever I go round

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
to somebody who says,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
It'll never happen. You don't have enough money.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
You don't have enough time.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
There's something much more interesting around the corner,"

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
I say, "Try saying that to her."

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
"thank you," and I go on to the next one.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
This is why we have to solve our problems,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and I know the answer as to how

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
is to be able to get exquisite control

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
over a building block of nature,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
the stuff of life:

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
the simple electron.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Thank you.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:39.260
(Applause)
