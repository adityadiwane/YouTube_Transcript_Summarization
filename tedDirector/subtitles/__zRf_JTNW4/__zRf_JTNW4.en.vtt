00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Come with me to the bottom of the world,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Antarctica,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the highest, driest, windiest,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and yes, coldest region on Earth --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
more arid than the Sahara

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and, in parts, colder than Mars.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
The ice of Antarctica glows

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
with a light so dazzling,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
it blinds the unprotected eye.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to kill the pain of it.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Yet, the ice of Antarctica

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
is a calendar of climate change.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It records the annual rise and fall

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
of greenhouse gases and temperatures

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
going back before the onset of the last ice ages.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Nowhere on Earth

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
offers us such a perfect record.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And here, scientists are drilling

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
into the past of our planet

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
to find clues to the future

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of climate change.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
This past January,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
about 600 miles from the South Pole.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
It is the best place on the planet, many say,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to study the history of climate change.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
have been working to answer a central question

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
about global warming.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
What is the exact relationship

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
between levels of greenhouse gases

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and planetary temperatures?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
What we don't know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is the exact, precise, immediate

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
impact of these changes

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
on natural climate patterns --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
winds, ocean currents,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
precipitation rates, cloud formation,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
things that bear on the health and well-being

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
of billions of people.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Their entire camp, every item of gear,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
was ferried 885 miles

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
from McMurdo Station,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
the main U.S. supply base

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
on the coast of Antarctica.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
WAIS Divide itself though,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
is a circle of tents in the snow.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
so that people can feel their way safely

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to the nearest ice house

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and to the nearest outhouse.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It snows so heavily there,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
the installation was almost immediately buried.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Indeed, the researchers picked this site

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
because ice and snow accumulates here

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They have to dig themselves out every day.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
It makes for an exotic

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and chilly commute.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
(Laughter)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
But under the surface

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
is a hive of industrial activity

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to extract a marrow of gases

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and isotopes for analysis.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Ten times a day, they extract

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
laid down by snow,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
season after season for thousands of years.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's really a time machine.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
At the peak of activity earlier this year,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the researchers lowered the drill

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and another 365 years

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
deeper into the past.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Periodically, they remove

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
a cylinder of ice,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
from the barrel of a drill.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
They inspect it, they check it for cracks,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
More importantly,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
they prepare it for inspection and analysis

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
by 27 independent laboratories

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
in the United States and Europe,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
related to climate,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
some in parts per quadrillion.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
for easier handling and shipment

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
back to these labs,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
some 8,000 miles from the drill site.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Each cylinder

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
is a parfait of time.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
This ice formed as snow

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
15,800 years ago,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and considering the radical new technology

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
of the alphabet.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Bathed in polarized light

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and cut in cross-section,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
this ancient ice reveals itself

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
as a mosaic of colors,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
have affected this material

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
at depths where pressures can reach

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
a ton per square inch.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Every year, it begins with a snowflake,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and by digging into fresh snow,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
we can see how this process is ongoing today.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
This wall of undisturbed snow,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
back-lit by sunlight,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
shows the striations of winter and summer snow,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
layer upon layer.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Each storm scours the atmosphere,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
washing out dust, soot,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
trace chemicals,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and depositing them on the snow pack

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
year after year,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
millennia after millennia,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
creating a kind of periodic table of elements

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
that at this point

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
is more than 11,000 feet thick.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
We can see the calcium

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
from the world's deserts,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
soot from distant wildfires,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to this remote and very cold place.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Most importantly,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
these cylinders and this snow

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
trap air.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
a pristine time capsule

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
methane, nitrous oxide --

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
all unchanged from the day that snow formed

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and first fell.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And this is the object of their scrutiny.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But don't we already know

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
what we need to know about greenhouse gases?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Why do we need to study this anymore?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Don't we already know the consequences

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of a changing climate on our settled civilization?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
The truth is, we only know the outlines,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and what we don't completely understand,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
we can't properly fix.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Consider, the single most successful

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
international environmental effort of the 20th century,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
the Montreal Protocol,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
used at that time

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We banned those chemicals,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and we replaced them, unknowingly,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
with other substances

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
that, molecule per molecule,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
are a hundred times more potent

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
than carbon dioxide.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
This process requires

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
extraordinary precautions.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
The scientists must insure

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that the ice is not contaminated.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
They have to, in fact,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
make sure this ice never gets warmer

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
than about 20 degrees below zero,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
So, in the coldest place on Earth,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
they work inside a refrigerator.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
As they handle the ice, in fact,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
so that, when their work gloves freeze

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and their fingers stiffen,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
they can don a fresh pair.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
They work against the clock and against the thermometer.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So far, they've packed up

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
about 4,500 feet of ice cores

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
for shipment back to the United States.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
This past season,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
they manhandled them across the ice

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to waiting aircraft.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
The 109th Air National Guard

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
flew the most recent shipment of ice

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
back to the coast of Antarctica,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
where it was boarded onto a freighter,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
shipped across the tropics to California,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
unloaded, put on a truck,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
driven across the desert

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
where, as we speak,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
scientists are now slicing this material up

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
for samples, for analysis,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
to be distributed

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to the laboratories around the country

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and in Europe.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Antarctica was this planet's

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
last empty quarter --

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
the blind spot

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
in our expanding vision of the world.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Early explorers

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
sailed off the edge of the map,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and they found a place

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
where the normal rules of time and temperature

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
seem suspended.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Here, the ice seems a living presence.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
The wind that rubs against it

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
gives it voice.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
It is a voice of experience.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
It is a voice we should heed.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Thank you.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
(Applause)
