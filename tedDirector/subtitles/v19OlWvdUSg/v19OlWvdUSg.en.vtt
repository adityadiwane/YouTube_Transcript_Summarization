00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:16.636
Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:20.542
that weighs less than a bicycle,

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.888
that you can carry with you anywhere,

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:28.380
that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.628
and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.980
on about a dollar of electricity.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.268
But when I say the word electric vehicle,

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.156
people think about vehicles. They think about cars

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:41.874
and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.170
But if you come about it from a different perspective,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.472
you can create some more interesting,

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:49.152
more novel concepts.

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:51.408
So we built something.

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:54.102
I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:56.192
So this is the motor.

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:57.801
This motor has enough power to take you

00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:01.608
up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:03.434
about 30 kilometers an hour,

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:07.524
and this battery, this battery right here

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:11.472
has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:14.275
which is enough to cover about half of the car trips

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.672
in the U.S. alone.

00:01:16.672 --> 00:01:18.451
But the best part about these components

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.648
is that we bought them at a toy store.

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:23.072
These are from remote control airplanes.

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:25.216
And the performance of these things has gotten so good

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:27.512
that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:29.015
you can really change things.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:31.012
So today we're going to show you one example

00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:33.089
of how you can use this.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:35.888
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is,

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:38.966
but also how the portability that comes with this

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:43.313
can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:48.676

(Applause)

00:02:56.517 --> 00:03:00.829
(Cheers)

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.122
So we're going to show you what this thing can do.

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:06.815
It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:10.394
so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:14.723
go in reverse if you like, also have braking.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.488
It's incredible just how light this thing is.

00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:25.617
I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:28.553
anywhere you go.

00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:31.729
So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.585
about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:37.977
This uses 20 times less energy

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:41.344
for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,

00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:44.977
which means not only is this thing fast to charge

00:03:44.977 --> 00:03:46.666
and really cheap to build,

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:50.017
but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.652
in terms of your transportation.

00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:54.411
So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed

00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:57.345
for each person in this room to get around in a city,

00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.465
now you can look at much smaller amounts

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.905
and more sustainable transportation.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.267
So next time you think about a vehicle,

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:06.573
I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:07.711
Thank you.

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:13.665
(Applause)
