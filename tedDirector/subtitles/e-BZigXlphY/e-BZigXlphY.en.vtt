00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.056
Twelve years ago, I picked up
a camera for the first time

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.200
to film the olive harvest
in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.296
I thought I was there
to make a single documentary

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.176
and would then move on
to some other part of the world.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.480
But something kept bringing me back.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.296
Now, usually, when international audiences
hear about that part of the world,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.856
they often just want
that conflict to go away.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.520
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
and we wish it could just disappear.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.480
We feel much the same way
about other conflicts around the world.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.296
But every time we turn
our attention to the news,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.280
it seems like one more country
has gone up in flames.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.016
So I've been wondering

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.360
whether we should not start
looking at conflict in a different way --

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.136
whether instead of simply
wishing to end conflict,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.176
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.256
This has been a big question for me,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.920
one I've pursued together with my team
at the nonprofit Just Vision.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.416
After witnessing several different kinds
of struggles in the Middle East,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.656
I started noticing some patterns
on the more successful ones.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.816
I wondered whether these variables
held across cases, and if they did,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.736
what lessons we could glean
for waging constructive conflict,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.600
in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.920
There is some science about this.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.936
In a study of 323
major political conflicts

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.936
from 1900 to 2006,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.256
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
found that nonviolent campaigns

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.520
were almost 100 percent more likely
to lead to success than violent campaigns.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.376
Nonviolent campaigns are also
less likely to cause physical harm

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.336
to those waging the campaign,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.496
as well as their opponents.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.400
And, critically, they typically lead
to more peaceful and democratic societies.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.136
In other words, nonviolent resistance
is a more effective and constructive way

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.360
of waging conflict.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920
But if that's such an easy choice,
why don't more groups use it?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.896
Political scientist Victor Asal
and colleagues

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.696
have looked at several factors

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.280
that shape a political group's
choice of tactics.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.160
And it turns out
that the greatest predictor

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.336
of a movement's decision
to adopt nonviolence or violence

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.696
is not whether that group
is more left-wing or right-wing,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.816
not whether the group is more or less
influenced by religious beliefs,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.896
not whether it's up against
a democracy or a dictatorship,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.520
and not even the levels of repression
that that group is facing.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.320
The greatest predictor of a movement's
decision to adopt nonviolence

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.560
is its ideology regarding
the role of women in public life.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.600
(Applause)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.096
When a movement includes in its discourse

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.856
language around gender equality,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.216
it increases dramatically
the chances it will adopt nonviolence,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.560
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.056
The research squared up
with my own documentation

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.416
of political organizing
in Israel and Palestine.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.856
I've noticed that movements which
welcome women into leadership positions,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.176
such as the one I documented
in a village called Budrus,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.800
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.936
This village was under a real threat
of being wiped off the map

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.800
when Israel started building
the separation barrier.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.416
The proposed route would require

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.936
the destruction of this community's
olive groves, their cemeteries

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.800
and would ultimately
enclose the village from all sides.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.536
Through inspired local leadership,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.200
they launched a nonviolent resistance
campaign to stop that from happening.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.520
The odds were massively
stacked against them.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.920
But they had a secret weapon:

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.656
a 15-year-old girl

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.416
who courageously jumped
in front of a bulldozer

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.920
which was about to uproot
an olive tree, stopping it.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.216
In that moment, the community
of Budrus realized what was possible

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.840
if they welcomed and encouraged women
to participate in public life.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.416
And so it was that the women of Budrus
went to the front lines day after day,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.896
using their creativity and acumen
to overcome multiple obstacles they faced

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.000
in a 10-month unarmed struggle.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And as you can probably
tell at this point,

00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:50.224
they win at the end.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.696
The separation barrier
was changed completely

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.456
to the internationally
recognized green line,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.216
and the women of Budrus
came to be known across the West Bank

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.240
for their indomitable energy.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.296
(Applause)

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.680
Thank you.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.256
I want to pause for a second,
which you helped me do,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.216
because I do want to tackle
two very serious misunderstandings

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.840
that could happen at this point.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.256
The first one is that I don't believe

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.320
women are inherently or essentially
more peaceful than men.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.176
But I do believe that in today's world,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.080
women experience power differently.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.456
Having had to navigate
being in the less powerful position

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.216
in multiple aspects of their lives,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.576
women are often more adept

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.856
at how to surreptitiously
pressure for change

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.616
against large, powerful actors.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.816
The term "manipulative," often charged
against women in a derogatory way,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.816
reflects a reality in which women
have often had to find ways

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.240
other than direct confrontation
to achieve their goals.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.976
And finding alternatives
to direct confrontation

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.080
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.856
Now to the second
potential misunderstanding.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.896
I've been talking a lot about
my experiences in the Middle East,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.736
and some of you might be thinking now

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.536
that the solution then is for us
to educate Muslim and Arab societies

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.280
to be more inclusive of their women.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.840
If we were to do that,
they would be more successful.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.120
They do not need this kind of help.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.296
Women have been part
of the most influential movements

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.840
coming out of the Middle East,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.056
but they tend to be invisible
to the international community.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.816
Our cameras are largely focused on the men

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.896
who often end up involved
in the more confrontational scenes

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.440
that we find so irresistible
in our news cycle.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.936
And we end up with a narrative
that not only erases women

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.896
from the struggles in the region

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.560
but often misrepresents
the struggles themselves.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.256
In the late 1980s,
an uprising started in Gaza,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.360
and quickly spread to the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.616
It came to be known as the First Intifada,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.976
and people who have
any visual memory of it

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.800
generally conjure up something like this:

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.640
Palestinian men
throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.296
The news coverage at the time

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.056
made it seem like stones,
Molotov cocktails and burning tires

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.120
were the only activities
taking place in the Intifada.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.336
This period, though, was also marked
by widespread nonviolent organizing

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.080
in the forms of strikes, sit-ins
and the creation of parallel institutions.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.256
During the First Intifada,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.616
whole sectors of the Palestinian
civilian population mobilized,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.400
cutting across generations,
factions and class lines.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.896
They did this through networks
of popular committees,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.416
and their use of direct action
and communal self-help projects

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.856
challenged Israel's very ability

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.560
to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.936
According to the Israeli Army itself,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.520
97 percent of activities
during the First Intifada were unarmed.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.640
And here's another thing that is not
part of our narrative about that time.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.776
For 18 months in the Intifada,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.616
women were the ones
calling the shots behind the scenes:

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.136
Palestinian women from all walks of life

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.576
in charge of mobilizing
hundreds of thousands of people

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.480
in a concerted effort to withdraw
consent from the occupation.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.056
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build
a self-sufficient Palestinian economy

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.296
by encouraging women in Gaza
to grow vegetables in their backyards,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.880
an activity deemed illegal
by the Israeli authorities at that time;

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.776
Rabeha Diab, who took over
decision-making authority

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.216
for the entire uprising

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.016
when the men who had been running it

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.240
were deported;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.936
Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets
containing the uprising's directives

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.736
in order to spread them
across the territories

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.320
without getting caught;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.376
and Zahira Kamal,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.696
who ensured the longevity of the uprising

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.256
by leading an organization

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.200
that went from 25 women
to 3,000 in a single year.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.176
Despite their extraordinary achievements,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
none of these women have made it
into our narrative of the First Intifada.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.000
We do this in other parts
of the globe, too.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.016
In our history books, for instance,
and in our collective consciousness,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.096
men are the public faces and spokespersons

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.200
for the 1960s struggle
for racial justice in the United States.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.856
But women were also
a critical driving force,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.960
mobilizing, organizing,
taking to the streets.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.336
How many of us think of Septima Clark

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.960
when we think of the United States
Civil Rights era?

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.280
Remarkably few.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.216
But she played a crucial role
in every phase of the struggle,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.896
particularly by emphasizing
literacy and education.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.416
She's been omitted, ignored,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.136
like so many other women
who played critical roles

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.200
in the United States
Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.000
This is not about getting credit.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.960
It's more profound than that.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.536
The stories we tell matter deeply
to how we see ourselves,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.256
and to how we believe movements are run

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.160
and how movements are won.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.816
The stories we tell about a movement
like the First Intifada

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.776
or the United States Civil Rights era

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.896
matter deeply
and have a critical influence

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.576
in the choices Palestinians,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.896
Americans

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.016
and people around the world will make

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.336
next time they encounter an injustice

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.640
and develop the courage to confront it.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.816
If we do not lift up the women who played
critical roles in these struggles,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.800
we fail to offer up role models
to future generations.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.256
Without role models, it becomes harder

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.296
for women to take up their rightful space

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.520
in public life.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.456
And as we saw earlier,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.296
one of the most critical variables

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.496
in determining whether
a movement will be successful or not

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.536
is a movement's ideology
regarding the role of women

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.760
in public life.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.376
This is a question of whether we're moving

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.280
towards more democratic
and peaceful societies.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.736
In a world where so much
change is happening,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.000
and where change is bound to continue
at an increasingly faster pace,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.600
it is not a question
of whether we will face conflict,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.216
but rather a question

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.616
of which stories will shape

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.560
how we choose to wage conflict.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.016
Thank you.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.842
