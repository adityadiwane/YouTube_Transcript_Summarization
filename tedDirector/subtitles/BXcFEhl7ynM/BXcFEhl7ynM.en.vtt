00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.494
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:20.169
AI researchers have always said

00:00:20.193 --> 00:00:22.787
that we humans do not need to worry,

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:26.391
because only menial jobs
will be taken over by machines.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.697
Is that really true?

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.012
They have also said
that AI will create new jobs,

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:37.447
so those who lose their jobs
will find a new one.

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:39.439
Of course.

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:41.635
But the real question is:

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.764
How many of those
who may lose their jobs to AI

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:48.277
will be able to land a new one,

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:54.151
especially when AI is smart enough
to learn better than most of us?

00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:57.402
Let me ask you a question:

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:00.284
How many of you think

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:06.402
that AI will pass the entrance examination
of a top university by 2020?

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:10.113
Oh, so many. OK.

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.495
So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!"

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.323
Now singularity is the issue.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.505
And some others may say, "Maybe,

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.037
because AI already won
against a top Go player."

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:30.714
And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh."

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:35.608
That means we do not know
the answer yet, right?

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:41.048
So that was the reason why
I started Todai Robot Project,

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:44.944
making an AI which passes
the entrance examination

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.557
of the University of Tokyo,

00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:50.118
the top university in Japan.

00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:53.832
This is our Todai Robot.

00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:01.761
And, of course, the brain of the robot
is working in the remote server.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:06.789
It is now writing a 600-word essay

00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.932
on maritime trade in the 17th century.

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:12.721
How does that sound?

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:18.037
Why did I take the entrance exam
as its benchmark?

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:23.659
Because I thought we had to study
the performance of AI

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:25.797
in comparison to humans,

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:28.681
especially on the skills and expertise

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:32.793
which are believed
to be acquired only by humans

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:35.152
and only through education.

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:39.645
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.090
you have to pass
two different types of exams.

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:47.874
The first one is
a national standardized test

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:50.301
in multiple-choice style.

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:52.780
You have to take seven subjects

00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:54.759
and achieve a high score --

00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:59.555
I would say like an 84 percent
or more accuracy rate --

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.666
to be allowed to take
the second stage written test

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.849
prepared by Todai.

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:12.131
So let me first explain
how modern AI works,

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:15.224
taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge
as an example.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.438
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:

00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:24.923
"Mozart's last symphony
shares its name with this planet."

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:30.028
Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!"
question always asks,

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:33.380
always ends with "this" something:

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:36.231
"this" planet, "this" country,

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.863
"this" rock musician, and so on.

00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:43.186
In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask
many different types of questions,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.047
but a single type,

00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.607
which we call "factoid questions."

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.962
By the way, do you know the answer?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.855
If you do not know the answer
and if you want to know the answer,

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.166
what would you do?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.112
You Google, right? Of course.

00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:04.616
Why not?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.232
But you have to pick appropriate keywords

00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:12.620
like "Mozart," "last"
and "symphony" to search.

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:15.682
The machine basically does the same.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:20.937
Then this Wikipedia page
will be ranked top.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.568
Then the machine reads the page.

00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:24.763
No, uh-uh.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.752
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:32.744
including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,

00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:34.429
is able to read.

00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:39.057
But they are very good
at searching and optimizing.

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:42.001
It will recognize

00:04:42.686 --> 00:04:45.621
that the keywords "Mozart,"
"last" and "symphony"

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:48.548
are appearing heavily around here.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.985
So if it can find a word which is a planet

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.657
and which is co-occurring
with these keywords,

00:04:57.681 --> 00:04:59.670
that must be the answer.

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:05.768
This is how Watson finds
the answer "Jupiter," in this case.

00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:12.302
Our Todai Robot works similarly,
but a bit smarter

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:15.565
in answering history yes-no questions,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.043
like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'
Is this sentence true or false?"

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:27.074
Our robot starts producing
a factoid question,

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:31.997
like: "Charlemagne repelled
[this person type]" by itself.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:37.547
Then, "Avars" but not
"Magyars" is ranked top.

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:41.226
This sentence is likely to be false.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:47.452
Our robot does not read,
does not understand,

00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:52.299
but it is statistically
correct in many cases.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.475
For the second stage written test,

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.605
it is required to write
a 600-word essay like this one:

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.907
[Discuss the rise and fall
of the maritime trade

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:06.353
in East and Southeast Asia
in the 17th century ...]

00:06:06.377 --> 00:06:07.764
and as I have shown earlier,

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:11.982
our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia,

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.967
combined them together,

00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:17.610
and optimized it to produce an essay

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:19.841
without understanding a thing.

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:21.602
(Laughter)

00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:26.521
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay

00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:28.106
than most of the students.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.521
(Laughter)

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:32.074
How about mathematics?

00:06:33.174 --> 00:06:36.332
A fully automatic math-solving machine

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:37.987
has been a dream

00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:42.690
since the birth of the word
"artificial intelligence,"

00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:49.612
but it has stayed at the level
of arithmetic for a long, long time.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.700
Last year, we finally succeeded
in developing a system

00:06:56.724 --> 00:07:01.897
which solved pre-university-level
problems from end to end,

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.183
like this one.

00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:09.470
This is the original problem
written in Japanese,

00:07:09.494 --> 00:07:13.891
and we had to teach it
2,000 mathematical axioms

00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:16.689
and 8,000 Japanese words

00:07:16.713 --> 00:07:21.271
to make it accept the problems
written in natural language.

00:07:22.054 --> 00:07:25.596
And it is now translating
the original problems

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.759
into machine-readable formulas.

00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:36.497
Weird, but it is now ready
to solve it, I think.

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:37.932
Go and solve it.

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:42.922
Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.430
Even more weird,

00:07:45.454 --> 00:07:50.279
but probably this is the most
fun part for the machine.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.654
(Laughter)

00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:55.493
Now it outputs a perfect answer,

00:07:55.517 --> 00:08:00.224
though its proof is impossible to read,
even for mathematicians.

00:08:02.593 --> 00:08:09.554
Anyway, last year our robot
was among the top one percent

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:13.652
in the second stage written
exam in mathematics.

00:08:14.472 --> 00:08:17.682
(Applause)

00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:19.543
Thank you.

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:22.038
So, did it enter Todai?

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.859
No, not as I expected.

00:08:26.603 --> 00:08:28.002
Why?

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:30.665
Because it doesn't understand any meaning.

00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:36.207
Let me show you a typical error
it made in the English test.

00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:39.208
[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.
Just a few more minutes.

00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:42.271
Sunil: Wait. ______ .
Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]

00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:43.446
Two people are talking.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.524
For us, who can understand
the situation --

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.297
[1. "We walked for a long time."
2. "We're almost there."

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.353
3. "Your shoes look expensive."
4. "Your shoelace is untied."]

00:08:51.377 --> 00:08:54.250
it is obvious number four
is the correct answer, right?

00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:56.512
But Todai Robot chose number two,

00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:01.896
even after learning 15 billion
English sentences

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.648
using deep learning technologies.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.592
OK, so now you might
understand what I said:

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.867
modern AIs do not read,

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.304
do not understand.

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:20.505
They only disguise as if they do.

00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:27.668
This is the distribution graph

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:33.469
of half a million students
who took the same exam as Todai Robot.

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:39.543
Now our Todai Robot
is among the top 20 percent,

00:09:40.806 --> 00:09:43.221
and it was capable to pass

00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:47.186
more than 60 percent
of the universities in Japan --

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.587
but not Todai.

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:53.961
But see how it is beyond the volume zone

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:56.849
of to-be white-collar workers.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.738
You might think I was delighted.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:07.730
After all, my robot was surpassing
students everywhere.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:11.533
Instead, I was alarmed.

00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:18.513
How on earth could this unintelligent
machine outperform students --

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:19.829
our children?

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.006
Right?

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:26.323
I decided to investigate
what was going on in the human world.

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:33.091
I took hundreds of sentences
from high school textbooks

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.992
and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:41.159
and asked thousands
of high school students to answer.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.686
Here is an example:

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.528
[Buddhism spread to ... ,
Christianity to ... and Oceania,

00:10:46.552 --> 00:10:47.703
and Islam to ...]

00:10:47.727 --> 00:10:50.467
Of course, the original problems
are written in Japanese,

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:51.646
their mother tongue.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.185
[ ______ has spread to Oceania.

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:55.626
1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.949
Obviously, Christianity
is the answer, isn't it?

00:10:57.973 --> 00:10:59.187
It's written!

00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:05.328
And Todai Robot chose
the correct answer, too.

00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:11.457
But one-third of junior
high school students

00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:14.093
failed to answer this question.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:19.435
Do you think it is only the case in Japan?

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:21.435
I do not think so,

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:27.830
because Japan is always ranked
among the top in OECD PISA tests,

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.781
measuring 15-year-old
students' performance in mathematics,

00:11:31.805 --> 00:11:33.769
science and reading

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.429
every three years.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.263
We have been believing

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:43.330
that everybody can learn

00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:45.259
and learn well,

00:11:45.283 --> 00:11:48.980
as long as we provide
good learning materials

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:50.459
free on the web

00:11:50.483 --> 00:11:53.552
so that they can access
through the internet.

00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:59.435
But such wonderful materials
may benefit only those who can read well,

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:04.289
and the percentage
of those who can read well

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:07.691
may be much less than we expected.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.101
How we humans will coexist with AI

00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:17.647
is something we have
to think about carefully,

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.808
based on solid evidence.

00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:24.860
At the same time,
we have to think in a hurry

00:12:24.884 --> 00:12:27.286
because time is running out.

00:12:27.926 --> 00:12:29.088
Thank you.

00:12:29.446 --> 00:12:33.379
(Applause)

00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:36.111
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:37.900
Noriko Arai: Thank you.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:43.228
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully
give us a sense of how AIs think,

00:12:43.252 --> 00:12:44.816
what they can do amazingly

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.535
and what they can't do.

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:48.053
But -- do I read you right,

00:12:48.077 --> 00:12:53.347
that you think we really need
quite an urgent revolution in education

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:57.526
to help kids do the things
that humans can do better than AIs?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.878
NA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:58.902 --> 00:13:02.937
Because we humans
can understand the meaning.

00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:07.867
That is something
which is very, very lacking in AI.

00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:12.259
But most of the students
just pack the knowledge

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:16.186
without understanding
the meaning of the knowledge,

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.019
so that is not knowledge,
that is just memorizing,

00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:21.493
and AI can do the same thing.

00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:25.148
So we have to think about
a new type of education.

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:28.461
CA: A shift from knowledge,
rote knowledge, to meaning.

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:29.636
NA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.900
CA: Well, there's a challenge
for the educators. Thank you so much.

00:13:32.924 --> 00:13:34.622
NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:35.831
(Applause)
