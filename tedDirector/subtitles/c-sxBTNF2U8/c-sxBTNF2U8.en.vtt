00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The night before I was heading for Scotland,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I was invited to host the final

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Guess who was the performing guest?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Susan Boyle.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
She sang beautifully,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
送你葱

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that ordinary stuff.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It means "green onion for free."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Why did she say that?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Because it was a line

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
a 50-some year-old woman,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
who loves singing Western opera,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
but she didn't understand

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
any English or French or Italian,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
so she managed to fill in the lyrics

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
with vegetable names in Chinese.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
(Laughter)

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that she was singing in the stadium

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
was "green onion for free."

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
80,000 live audience sang together.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
That was hilarious.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So I guess both Susan Boyle

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
belonged to otherness.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
They were the least expected to be successful

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in the business called entertainment,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
yet their courage and talent brought them through.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And a show and a platform

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
gave them the stage

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
to realize their dreams.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Well, being different is not that difficult.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
We are all different

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
from different perspectives.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But I think being different is good,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
because you present a different point of view.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
You may have the chance to make a difference.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
My generation has been very fortunate

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
to witness and participate

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
in the historic transformation of China

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
that has made so many changes

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
in the past 20, 30 years.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I remember that in the year of 1990,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
when I was graduating from college,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I was applying for a job in the sales department

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
of the first five-star hotel in Beijing,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So after being interrogated

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
by this Japanese manager for a half an hour,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
he finally said,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
"So, Miss Yang,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
do you have any questions to ask me?"

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I summoned my courage and poise and said,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
"Yes, but could you let me know,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
what actually do you sell?"

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
in a five-star hotel.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
That was the first day I set my foot

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
in a five-star hotel.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Around the same time,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I was going through an audition --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
the first ever open audition

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
by national television in China --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
with another thousand college girls.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
The producer told us

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
they were looking for some sweet, innocent

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and beautiful fresh face.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
"Why [do] women's personalities on television

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and, you know, supportive?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Why can't they have their own ideas

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and their own voice?"

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I thought I kind of offended them.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But actually, they were impressed by my words.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And so I was in the second round of competition,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and then the third and the fourth.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
After seven rounds of competition,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I was the last one to survive it.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So I was on a national television prime-time show.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And believe it or not,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that was the first show on Chinese television

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that allowed its hosts

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to speak out of their own minds

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
without reading an approved script.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
(Applause)

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And my weekly audience at that time

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
was between 200 to 300 million people.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Well after a few years,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to pursue my postgraduate studies,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and then started my own media company,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
which was unthought of

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
during the years that I started my career.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
So we do a lot of things.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And sometimes I have young people approaching me

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
say, "Lan, you changed my life,"

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and I feel proud of that.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But then we are also so fortunate

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to witness the transformation of the whole country.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I was representing the Shanghai Expo.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I saw China embracing the world

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and vice versa.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
But then sometimes I'm thinking,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
what are today's young generation up to?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
How are they different,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and what are the differences they are going to make

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
to shape the future of China,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
or at large, the world?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So today I want to talk about young people

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
through the platform of social media.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
20 years old, beautiful.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
She showed off her expensive bags,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
clothes and car

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
on her microblog,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
which is the Chinese version of Twitter.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
at the Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
She didn't realize

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
that she stepped on a sensitive nerve

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and aroused national questioning,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
almost a turmoil,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
against the credibility of Red Cross.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
The controversy was so heated

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
that the Red Cross had to open a press conference

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
to clarify it,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and the investigation is going on.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So far, as of today,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
we know that she herself made up that title --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
All those expensive items

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
were given to her as gifts

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
by her boyfriend,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
who used to be a board member

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It's very complicated to explain.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
It is still boiling.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It shows us a general mistrust

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of government or government-backed institutions,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
which lacked transparency in the past.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And also it showed us

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
the power and the impact of social media

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
as microblog.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
with visitors doubled

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and time spent on it tripled.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Sina.com, a major news portal,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
On Tencent, 200 million.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
The most popular blogger --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
it's not me --

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
it's a movie star,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
under 30 years old.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And because, as you know,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
social media offers an opening

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
to let the steam out a little bit.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But because you don't have many other openings,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
the heat coming out of this opening

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
is sometimes very strong, active

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and even violent.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So through microblogging,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So how are they different?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
First of all, most of them were born

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
in the 80s and 90s,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
under the one-child policy.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And because of selected abortion

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
by families who favored boys to girls,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
now we have ended up

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
with 30 million more young men than women.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
That could pose

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
a potential danger to the society,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
but who knows;

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
we're in a globalized world,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.260
so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Most of them have fairly good education.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
is under one percent.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.260
But they are facing an aging China

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
with a population above 65 years old

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
coming up with seven-point-some percent this year,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and about to be 15 percent

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
by the year of 2030.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And you know we have the tradition

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
that younger generations support the elders financially,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and taking care of them when they're sick.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So it means young couples

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
will have to support four parents

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
So making a living is not that easy

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
for young people.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
College graduates are not in short supply.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
In urban areas,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
college graduates find the starting salary

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
while the average rent

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
is above $500.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So what do they do? They have to share space --

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
squeezed in very limited space

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
to save money --

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and they call themselves "tribe of ants."

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And for those who are ready to get married

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and buy their apartment,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
they figured out they have to work

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
for 30 to 40 years

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
to afford their first apartment.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
That ratio in America

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
would only cost a couple five years to earn,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
but in China it's 30 to 40 years

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
with the skyrocketing real estate price.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Among the 200 million migrant workers,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
60 percent of them are young people.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
They find themselves sort of sandwiched

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
between the urban areas and the rural areas.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
but they don't have the sense of belonging.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
They work for longer hours

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
with less income, less social welfare.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And they're more vulnerable

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
to job losses,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
subject to inflation,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
tightening loans from banks,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
appreciation of the renminbi,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
or decline of demand

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
from Europe or America

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
for the products they produce.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Last year, though,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
an appalling incident

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
13 young workers

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
in their late teens and early 20s

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
committed suicide,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
just one by one like causing a contagious disease.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.260
But they died because of all different personal reasons.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
But this whole incident

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
aroused a huge outcry from society

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
about the isolation,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
both physical and mental,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
of these migrant workers.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
For those who do return back to the countryside,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
they find themselves very welcome locally,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
because with the knowledge, skills and networks

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
they have learned in the cities,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
with the assistance of the Internet,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
they're able to create more jobs,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
upgrade local agriculture and create new business

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
in the less developed market.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
So for the past few years, the coastal areas,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
they found themselves in a shortage of labor.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
These diagrams show

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
a more general social background.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The first one is the Engels coefficient,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
which explains that the cost of daily necessities

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
has dropped its percentage

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
all through the past decade,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
in terms of family income,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
to about 37-some percent.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
But then in the last two years,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
it goes up again to 39 percent,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
indicating a rising living cost.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
The Gini coefficient

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Now it's 0.5 --

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
even worse than that in America --

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
showing us the income inequality.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And so you see this whole society

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
getting frustrated

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
about losing some of its mobility.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And also, the bitterness and even resentment

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
towards the rich and the powerful

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
is quite widespread.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
So any accusations of corruption

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.260
or backdoor dealings between authorities or business

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
would arouse a social outcry

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
or even unrest.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.260
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
we can see what young people care most about.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Social justice and government accountability

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
runs the first in what they demand.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
For the past decade or so,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.260
a massive urbanization and development

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
have let us witness a lot of reports

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
on the forced demolition

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
of private property.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
among our young generation.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Sometimes people get killed,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
So when these incidents are reported

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
more and more frequently on the Internet,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
So the good news is that earlier this year,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
the state council passed a new regulation

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
on house requisition and demolition

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and passed the right

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
to order forced demolition from local governments

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
to the court.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
is a hot topic on the Internet.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
We heard about polluted air,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
polluted water, poisoned food.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And guess what, we have faked beef.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
They have sorts of ingredients

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and it turns it to look like beef.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And then lately,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
people are very concerned about cooking oil,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
because thousands of people have been found

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
[refining] cooking oil

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
from restaurant slop.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
So all these things

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.260
have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And fortunately,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
we have seen the government

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
responding more timely and also more frequently

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
to the public concerns.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
While young people seem to be very sure

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
about their participation

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
in public policy-making,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
but sometimes they're a little bit lost

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
in terms of what they want for their personal life.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
China is soon to pass the U.S.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
as the number one market

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
for luxury brands --

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
that's not including the Chinese expenditures

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
in Europe and elsewhere.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
But you know what, half of those consumers

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
They're not rich at all.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
They're taking those bags and clothes

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
as a sense of identity and social status.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And this is a girl explicitly saying

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
on a TV dating show

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
that she would rather cry in a BMW

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
than smile on a bicycle.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
But of course, we do have young people

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
who would still prefer to smile,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and without a wedding banquet,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
to show their commitment to true love.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And also, people are doing good through social media.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And the first picture showed us

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
for food processing

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
was spotted and stopped on the highway

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
with the whole country watching

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
through microblogging.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
People were donating money, dog food

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
And after hours of negotiation,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
500 dogs were rescued.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.260
And here also people are helping to find missing children.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
After thousands of resends in relay,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
the child was found,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and we witnessed the reunion of the family

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
through microblogging.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
So happiness is the most popular word

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
we have heard through the past two years.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
Happiness is not only related

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
to personal experiences and personal values,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
but also, it's about the environment.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
People are thinking about the following questions:

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Are we going to sacrifice our environment further

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
to produce higher GDP?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
How are we going to perform our social and political reform

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
to keep pace with economic growth,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
to keep sustainability and stability?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
And also, how capable is the system

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
of self-correctness

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
to keep more people content

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And our younger generation

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
are going to transform this country

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.260
while at the same time being transformed themselves.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
(Applause)
