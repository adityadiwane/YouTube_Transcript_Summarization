00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:21.740
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007.

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.036
We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle.

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:29.178
It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.699
If you are a parent,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.663
you know that kids love
to keep making circles.

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:39.600
This is how the rooftop looks.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.858
And why did we design this?

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.675
The principal of this kindergarten said,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.254
"No, I don't want a handrail."

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:49.483
I said, "It's impossible."

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:55.777
But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof?

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:57.986
So that it can catch
the children falling off?"

00:00:57.986 --> 00:00:59.433
(Laughter)

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.509
I said, "It's impossible."

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.889
And of course,
the government official said,

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:08.154
"Of course you have to have a handrail."

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:13.843
But we could keep 
that idea around the trees.

00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:17.120
There are three trees popping through.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.745
And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail.

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:26.017
But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them.

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.503
They fall into the net.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:32.355
And you get more,

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:35.292
and more,

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:36.502
more.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:37.653
(Laughter)

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:41.203
Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.981
The boy on the branch,

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.464
he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree.

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:49.964
(Laughter)

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:52.785
And at the time of an event,

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:55.051
they sit on the edge.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.563
It looks so nice from underneath.

00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:00.652
Monkeys in the zoo.

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:04.552
(Laughter)

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:06.318
Feeding time.

00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:10.949
(Laughter) 
(Applause)

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.313
And we made the roof as low as possible,

00:02:15.313 --> 00:02:19.757
because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof,

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:22.438
not only underneath the roof.

00:02:22.438 --> 00:02:26.299
And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.215
And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps.

00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:34.434
You see with the flexible tubes,

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:37.329
you want to spray water
to your friends,

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.044
and the shower,

00:02:39.044 --> 00:02:41.541
and the one in front is quite normal.

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.087
But if you look at this,

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:44.917
the boy is not washing his boots,

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.591
he's putting water into his boots.

00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:48.531
(Laughter)

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:58.499
This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.339
And there is no boundary
between inside and outside.

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.978
So it means basically
this architecture is a roof.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:11.267
And also there is no boundary
between classrooms.

00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:14.861
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.415
When you put many children in a quiet box,

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:24.733
some of them get really nervous.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:26.985
But in this kindergarten,

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.415
there is no reason they get nervous.

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.225
Because there is no boundary.

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:35.422
And the principal says

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:39.425
if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room,

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:41.120
we let him go.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.279
He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.241
(Laughter)

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.556
But the point is,
in that kind of occasion,

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:54.407
usually children try to hide somewhere.

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:58.986
But here, just they leave and come back.

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:00.836
It's a natural process.

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:05.859
And secondly, we consider
noise very important.

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:14.142
You know that children
sleep better in noise.

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:17.986
They don't sleep in a quiet space.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.236
And in this kindergarten,

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:25.483
these children show
amazing concentration in class.

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:33.660
And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.663
They need noise.

00:04:35.663 --> 00:04:39.967
And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.928
You are not supposed to be in silence.

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:46.095
And you know, these days

00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:50.569
we are trying to make
everything under control.

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.021
You know, it's completely open.

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:57.033
And you should know that

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:02.818
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.

00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:05.922
In summer you go swimming.

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:07.766
The sand is 50 degrees.

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:12.029
And also, you should know
that you are waterproof.

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.181
You never melt in rain.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.050
So, children are supposed to be outside.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.251
So that is how we should treat them.

00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:24.923
This is how they divide classrooms.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.426
They are supposed to help teachers.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.731
They don't.

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.346
(Laughter)

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:37.382
I didn't put him in.

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:41.706
A classroom.

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:44.105
And a washbasin.

00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:47.932
They talk to each other around the well.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:52.819
And there are always 
some trees in the classroom.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.377
A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above.

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:01.225
(Laughter)

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:02.829
Monkeys.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.283
(Laughter)

00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:08.698
And each classroom has
at least one skylight.

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:13.465
And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas.

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:21.682
This is the annex building,

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:26.151
right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:31.810
The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.971
And of course,
the ceiling height is very low.

00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:38.036
So you have to consider safety.

00:06:38.036 --> 00:06:42.417
So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son.

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:46.241
They tried to go in.

00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:50.353
He hit his head.

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:55.312
He's okay. His skull is quite strong.

00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:58.400
He is resilient. It's my son.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.068
(Laughter)

00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:03.898
And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off.

00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:07.705
And then we put other children.

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:15.376
The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know.

00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:16.528
(Laughter)

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:21.379
The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive.

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.910
Now these days,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.530
kids need a small dosage of danger.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.375
And in this kind of occasion,

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:37.300
they learn to help each other.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.735
This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days.

00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:54.976
Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy

00:07:54.976 --> 00:08:01.300
between 9:10 and 9:30.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.501
And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters.

00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.353
So it's not exactly small at all.

00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:15.959
And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:19.551
But the surprise is yet to come.

00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:26.248
The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:34.435
And these children have
the highest athletic abilities

00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:37.590
among many kindergartens.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.016
The principal says,

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:50.743
"I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof.

00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:52.972
Just like sheep."

00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:54.401
(Laughter)

00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.230
They keep running.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.259
(Laughter)

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:03.838
My point is don't control them,

00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:07.060
don't protect them too much,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.687
and they need to tumble sometimes.

00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:14.473
They need to get some injury.

00:09:14.473 --> 00:09:17.892
And that makes them learn

00:09:17.892 --> 00:09:21.028
how to live in this world.

00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:31.057
I think architecture is capable
of changing this world,

00:09:31.057 --> 00:09:32.899
and people's lives.

00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:39.991
And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children.

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.133
Thank you very much.

00:09:42.158 --> 00:09:44.152
(Applause)
