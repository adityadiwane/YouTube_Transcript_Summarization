00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
which was to interview three politicians every day.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And from that much contact with politicians,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
(Laughter)

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
But what they do have is incredible social skills.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
When you meet them, they lock into you,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
they look you in the eye,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
they invade your personal space,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
they massage the back of your head.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
who kept his hand on my inner thigh

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I once -- this was years ago --

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And they were friends, and they hugged each other

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And they were moving and grinding

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and moving their arms up and down each other.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
But they have those social skills.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Another case:

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Last election cycle,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
(Laughter)

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And he's going into a diner.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?"

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And then he describes the home he owned in their village.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And so he goes around the room,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and then as he's leaving the diner,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
he first-names almost everybody he's just met.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill."

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
But the paradox is,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.260
when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that social awareness vanishes

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and they start talking like accountants.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So in the course of my career,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I have covered a series of failures.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
We sent economists in the Soviet Union

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
with privatization plans when it broke up,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and what they really lacked was social trust.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
We invaded Iraq with a military

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
We had a financial regulatory regime

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
based on the assumptions

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that traders were rational creatures

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
who wouldn't do anything stupid.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
charters, private schools, vouchers --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.260
but we've had disappointing results year after year.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And the fact is, people learn from people they love.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And if you're not talking about the individual relationship

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
between a teacher and a student,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
you're not talking about that reality.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
But that reality is expunged

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
from our policy-making process.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And so that's led to a question for me:

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
completely dehumanized

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
when they think about policy?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And I came to the conclusion,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
this is a symptom of a larger problem.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
based on the notion

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that we're divided selves,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that reason is separated from the emotions

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and that society progresses

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to the extent that reason can suppress the passions.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And it's led to a view of human nature

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that we're rational individuals

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
who respond in straightforward ways to incentives,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and it's led to ways of seeing the world

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
where people try to use the assumptions of physics

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
to measure how human behavior is.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And it's produced a great amputation,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
a shallow view of human nature.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
We're really good at talking about material things,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but we're really bad at talking about emotions.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
We're really good at talking about skills

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and safety and health;

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
we're really bad at talking about character.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
of virtue, honor, goodness,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
but we no longer have a system

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
by which to connect them."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
but also in a whole range of human endeavors.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and you watch the kids come out,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
You see these cars that drive up --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that's fine.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
who are highly successful career women

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And you can usually tell the uber-moms

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
because they actually weigh less than their own children.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
(Laughter)

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So at the moment of conception,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
they're doing little butt exercises.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Babies flop out,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
so they take them to Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
with its own foreign policy.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
In one of my books,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
I joke that Ben &amp; Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
It would be a big seller.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
(Laughter)

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
(Laughter)

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
They buy these seaweed-based snacks there

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
called Veggie Booty with Kale,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
which is for kids who come home and say,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
(Laughter)

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And so the kids are raised in a certain way,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and sometimes they make a success of themselves

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And sometimes you can see them at vacation places

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
like Jackson Hole or Aspen.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And they've become elegant and slender --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
they don't really have thighs;

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
they just have one elegant calve on top of another.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
(Laughter)

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
They have kids of their own,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
They get there and they realize

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
all look like velociraptors,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
all named after Jane Austen characters.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
I'm just not going to die."

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And so they hire personal trainers;

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
they're popping Cialis like breath mints.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
You see them on the mountains up there.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
They're cross-country skiing up the mountain

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
with these grim expressions

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
(Laughter)

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And as they whiz by you,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
going up the hill.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
(Laughter)

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And so this is part of what life is,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
but it's not all of what life is.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And over the past few years,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and a deeper view of who we are.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And it's not based on theology or philosophy,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
it's in the study of the mind,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
across all these spheres of research,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
behavioral economists, psychologists,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
sociology,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
we're developing a revolution in consciousness.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And when you synthesize it all,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
it's giving us a new view of human nature.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And I think when you synthesize this research,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
you start with three key insights.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
The first insight is

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.260
the unconscious mind does most of the work.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And so one way to formulate that is

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
of which it can be consciously aware of about 40.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And this leads to oddities.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
are disproportionately likely to become dentists,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
people named Lawrence become lawyers,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
because unconsciously we gravitate toward things

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that sound familiar,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Laughter)

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Another finding is that the unconscious,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
far from being dumb and sexualized,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
is actually quite smart.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And the way you should do that

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is study the furniture,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and then a few days later, go with your gut,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
because unconsciously you've figured it out.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
The second insight

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
People with strokes and lesions

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
in the emotion-processing parts of the brain

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
are not super smart,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
they're actually sometimes quite helpless.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And one of the things he's really shown us

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
is that emotions are not separate from reason,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
but they are the foundation of reason

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
because they tell us what to value.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And so reading and educating your emotions

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
is one of the central activities of wisdom.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
They put them into a brain scan machine --

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and they had them watch a horror movie,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And the brain scans were identical in both activities.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
It was just sheer terror.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So me talking about emotion

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
is like Gandhi talking about gluttony,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
but it is the central organizing process

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
of the way we think.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
It tells us what to imprint.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And the third insight

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
We're social animals, not rational animals.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
We emerge out of relationships,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
And so when we see another person,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
we reenact in our own minds

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
what we see in their minds.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
When we watch a car chase in a movie,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
When we watch pornography,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
it's a little like having sex,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
though probably not as good.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And we see this when lovers walk down the street,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
gets caught up in an emotional contagion,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
the deep interpenetration.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And this revolution in who we are

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
a different way, most importantly,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
of seeing human capital.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
We are now children of the French Enlightenment.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
But I think this research shows

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
with David Hume, Adam Smith,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
actually had a better handle on who we are --

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and our sentiments are often trustworthy.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And this work corrects that bias in our culture,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
that dehumanizing bias.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
It gives us a deeper sense

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
of what it actually takes

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
for us to thrive in this life.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
When we think about human capital

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
we think about the things we can measure easily --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
things like grades, SAT's, degrees,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
the number of years in schooling.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
are things that are deeper,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
things we don't really even have words for.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And so let me list just a couple of the things

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.260
I think this research points us toward trying to understand.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
The first gift, or talent, is mindsight --

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
the ability to enter into other people's minds

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and learn what they have to offer.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Babies come with this ability.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
He wagged his tongue at the baby.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
The baby wagged her tongue back.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
and to download what they find --

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
their models of how to understand reality.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
In the United States, 55 percent of babies

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
have a deep two-way conversation with Mom

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and they learn models to how to relate to other people.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And those people who have models of how to relate

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
have a huge head start in life.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
in which they could predict

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
who was going to graduate from high school,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
based on who had good attachment with mom.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
They are what we call avoidantly attached.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
They have trouble relating to other people.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
They go through life

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
like sailboats tacking into the wind --

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
wanting to get close to people,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
but not really having the models of how to do that.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And so this is one skill

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
A second skill is equipoise,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
the ability to have the serenity

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
to read the biases and failures in your own mind.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
So for example, we are overconfidence machines.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Ninety-five percent of our professors report

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
that they are above-average teachers.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Ninety-six percent of college students

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
say they have above-average social skills.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Time magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?"

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
(Laughter)

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
This is a gender-linked trait, by the way.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Men drown at twice the rate of women,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
because men think they can swim across that lake.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
But some people have the ability and awareness

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
of their own biases, their own overconfidence.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
They have epistemological modesty.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to the strength of their evidence.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
They are curious.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
The third trait is metis,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
It's a sensitivity to the physical environment,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
the ability to pick out patterns in an environment --

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
derive a gist.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
One of my colleagues at the Times

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
did a great story about soldiers in Iraq

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
who could look down a street and detect somehow

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
They couldn't tell you how they did it,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and they were more often right than wrong.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
The third is what you might call sympathy,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
the ability to work within groups.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And that comes in tremendously handy,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
because groups are smarter than individuals.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And face-to-face groups are much smarter

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
than groups that communicate electronically,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And the effectiveness of a group

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
is not determined by the IQ of the group;

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
it's determined by how well they communicate,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
how often they take turns in conversation.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Then you could talk about a trait like blending.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
Any child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
It seems so elementary.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger"

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and blend them together.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
But this is the source of innovation.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
What Picasso did, for example,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
was take the concept "Western art"

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and the concept "African masks"

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and blend them together --

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
not only the geometry,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
but the moral systems entailed in them.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And then the final thing I'll mention

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is something you might call limerence.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
And this is not an ability;

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
it's a drive and a motivation.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
The unconscious mind hungers

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
for those moments of transcendence,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
when the skull line disappears

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and we are lost in a challenge or a task --

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
when a craftsman feels lost in his craft,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
when a naturalist feels at one with nature,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
when a believer feels at one with God's love.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And many of us feel it in love

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
when lovers feel fused.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
And one of the most beautiful descriptions

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
I've come across in this research

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
of how minds interpenetrate

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
was written by a great theorist and scientist

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
He was married to a woman named Carol,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and they had a wonderful relationship.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
When their kids were five and two,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And Hofstadter wrote a book

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
called "I Am a Strange Loop."

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
In the course of that book, he describes a moment --

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
just months after Carol has died --

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
he comes across her picture on the mantel,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
or on a bureau in his bedroom.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
And here's what he wrote:

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
"I looked at her face,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
and I looked so deeply

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
that I felt I was behind her eyes.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And all at once I found myself saying

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
as tears flowed,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
'That's me. That's me.'

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
And those simple words

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
brought back many thoughts that I had had before,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
about the fusion of our souls

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
into one higher-level entity,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
about the fact that at the core of both our souls

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.260
lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
about the notion that those hopes

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
were not separate or distinct hopes,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
but were just one hope,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
one clear thing that defined us both,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
that welded us into a unit --

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
before being married and having children.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
I realized that, though Carol had died,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
that core piece of her had not died at all,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.260
but had lived on very determinedly in my brain."

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
how deeply interpenetrated we are.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Through the policy failures of the last 30 years,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
we have come to acknowledge, I think,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
how shallow our view of human nature has been.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
And now as we confront that shallowness

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
and the failures that derive from our inability

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
to get the depths of who we are,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
comes this revolution in consciousness --

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
these people in so many fields

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
exploring the depth of our nature

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
and coming away with this enchanted,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
this new humanism.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
it had a vast effect on the climate of the times.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
and it's going to have a wonderful and profound

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
and humanizing effect on our culture.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
Thank you.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:36.260
