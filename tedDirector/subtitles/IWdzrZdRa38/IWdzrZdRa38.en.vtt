00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I've always been interested in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the relationship of formal structures and human behavior.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Well, law is also a powerful driver

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
of human behavior.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And what I'd like to discuss today

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
is the need to overhaul and simplify the law

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to release the energy and passion

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
of Americans, so that we can begin

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
to address the challenges of our society.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
You might have noticed that law has grown

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
without calling your general counsel.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Indeed, there is this phenomenon now

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
You need a lawyer to run the company,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
because there's so much law.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But it's not just business that's affected by this,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
it's actually pressed down into the daily activities

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
of ordinary people.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
It was in a grizzly bear preserve,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
although no one told me that before we went.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And our guide was a local science teacher.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but she was terrified of lawyers.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The stories started pouring out.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
had threatened to sue the school

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
when he turned the paper in late.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
over and over again.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and raised the grade.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and she was going to drive them in her car,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
for liability reasons.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
You have to go in a school bus."

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
So, they provided a bus that held 60 people

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and drove the three of them back and forth

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
several hours to Laramie.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Her husband is also a science teacher,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and he takes his biology class on a hike

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
in the nearby national park.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
because one of the students in the class was disabled,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
At the end of this day I could have filled a book

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
just with stories about law

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
from this one teacher.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Now, we've been taught to believe that law

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
is the foundation of freedom.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the land of the free has become a legal minefield.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
It's really changed our lives in ways

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that are sort of imperceptible;

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
pediatrician friend

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in North Carolina. He said,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that might be used against you."

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
My own law firm has a list of questions

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
that I'm not allowed to ask

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
when interviewing candidates,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
such as the sinister question,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.260
bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
"Where are you from?"

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
(Laughter)

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that lawsuits are out of control.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And we read every once in while

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
because they lost his pair of pants.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
But the reality is, these crazy cases

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
are relatively rare. They don't usually win.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And the total of direct tort cost

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
in this country is about two percent,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
which is twice as much as in other countries

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
but, as taxes go, hardly crippling.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
What's happened here, again,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
almost without our knowing,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
is our culture has changed.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
People no longer feel free

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to act on their best judgment.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So, what do we do about it?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
We certainly don't want to give up the rights,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
We need regulation to make sure

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
people don't pollute and such.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
this problem,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that explain why Johnny

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Is it possible that the doctor

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
where it's possible that something could have been done differently.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
hoping that we can judge any dispute

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
against the standard of a perfect society,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
where everyone will agree what's fair,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and where accidents will be extinct,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
risk will be no more.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Of course, this is Utopia;

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It's not the basis of the rule of law,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
it's not the basis of a free society.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So, now I have the first of four propositions

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
You've got to judge law mainly

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
by its effect on the broader society,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
not individual disputes.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Absolutely vital.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and look at our society from high above.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Is it working?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
What does the macro-data show us?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
a culture pervaded with defensiveness,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
universal distrust of the system of justice,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
universal practice of defensive medicine.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's very hard to measure

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
because there are mixed motives.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But reliable estimates

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
range between 60 billion and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
200 billion dollars per year.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
That's enough to provide care to all the people

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
in America who don't have it.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
makes doctors practice better medicine."

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and others. Turns out that's not the case.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
The fear has chilled professional interaction

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
so thousands of tragic errors occur

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
because doctors are afraid

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Because they're not sure,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and they don't want to take legal responsibility.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Let's go to schools.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
she seems to be affected by the law.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
You could have a separate section of a law library

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
around each of the following legal concepts:

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
due process, special education,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
no child left behind,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
zero tolerance, work rules ...

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
it goes on. We did a study

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
of all the rules that affect one school

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Tens of thousands of discreet rules,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
60 steps to suspend a student from school:

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It's a formula for paralysis.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Again, studies have shown

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
it's directly attributable

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
to the rise of due process.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
say that they spend at least half of their time

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
maintaining order in the classroom.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
That means those students are getting half the learning

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
no one can learn.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
They're threatened with a legal claim.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
in America have been threatened by their students

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
with violating their rights, with lawsuits

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
by their students. They are threatening, their students.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It's not that they usually sue,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
it's not that they would win, but it's an

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
indication of the corrosion of authority.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And how has this system of law worked for government?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
The other day at the State of the Union speech,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
President Obama said,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and I think we could all agree with this goal,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
our nation has always been the first to compete.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.260
There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Well, actually there is a reason:

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Environmental review has evolved into a process

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
of no pebble left unturned

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
for any major project taking the better part of a decade,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
then followed by years of litigation

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
by anybody who doesn't like the project.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
people are acting like idiots,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.260
(Laughter)

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
all across the country.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
(Applause)

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Idiots. A couple of years ago,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.260
(Laughter)

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
That means all the boys are going to be ADD.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I mean it's just absolutely

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
a formula for failure.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
My favorite, though, are all the warning labels.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
"Caution: Contents are hot,"

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
on billions of coffee cups.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
That's the only explanation. Because why

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
would you have to tell people that something was actually hot?

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
with a three pronged hook in the back,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:38.260
(Laughter)

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So, none of these people

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
are doing what they think is right.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anything

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and it's also too detailed.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
no human could possibly know it.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
trying to prune this legal jungle.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
But the challenge here is not one of just

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
amending the law,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
because the hurdle for success is trust.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
People -- for law to be the platform for freedom,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
people have to trust it.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So, that's my second proposition:

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Trust is an essential condition

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
to a free society.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
because it carries with it the power of state.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And so the state can come in.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
It actually changes the way people think.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
all day long, whispering in your ear,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
It drives people from the smart part of the brain --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that dark, deep well of the subconscious,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
where instincts and experience,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and all the other factors of creativity

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and good judgment are --

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
If you make people self-conscious

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
about their judgments, studies show

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
you will make them make worse judgments.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.260
If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.260
when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Edison stated it best. He said,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
we're trying to accomplish something."

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
(Laughter)

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.260
So, how do you restore trust?

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and tort reform, which is a great idea,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
States with extensive tort reform

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
still suffer all these pathologies.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
but actually create a dry ground of freedom.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And it is this:

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Law sets boundaries,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
and on one side of those boundaries are all the things

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
you can't do or must do --

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.260
you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
but those same boundaries are supposed to define

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and protect a dry ground of freedom.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Isaiah Berlin put it this way:

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.260
within which men shall be inviolable."

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
We've forgotten that second part.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Those dikes have burst. People wade through law

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
all day long.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
So, what's needed now

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
is to rebuild these boundaries.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And it's especially important to rebuild them

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
for lawsuits.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
for everybody else's freedom.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
all the seesaws will disappear.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
because there's no risk associated with it.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So, how do we rebuild it?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Life is too complex for...

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.260
(Applause)

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Life is too complex for a software program.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
All these choices involve value judgments

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and social norms, not objective facts.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And so here is the fourth proposition.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
And there are two essential elements of it:

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We have to simplify the law.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
We have to migrate from all this complexity

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
towards general principles and goals.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
The constitution is only 16 pages long.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Worked pretty well for 200 years.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Law has to be simple enough

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
so that people can internalize it

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
in their daily choices.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And how do you make it simple?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Because life is complex,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and here is the hardest and biggest change:

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
We have to restore the authority

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
to judges and officials

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
to interpret and apply the law.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
(Applause)

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
We have to rehumanize the law.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
To make law simple so that you feel free,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
the people in charge have to be free

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
in accord with reasonable social norms.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.260
As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
you have to think that if there is a dispute,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.260
there's somebody in society who sees it as their job

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
to affirmatively protect you

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
if you're acting reasonably.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
That person doesn't exist today.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
This is the hardest hurdle.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
for your lost pair of pants for $100,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Takes five minutes. That's it,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
it's not that hard.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
because we woke up in the 1960s

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
to all these really bad values: racism,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
gender discrimination, pollution --

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
where no one could have bad values anymore.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
The problem is, we created a system

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
where we eliminated the right to have good values.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.260
It doesn't mean that people in authority

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
can do whatever they want.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
The teacher is accountable to the principal,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
the judge is accountable to an appellate court,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
the president is accountable to voters.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
But the accountability's up the line

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
judging the decision against the effect on everybody,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
not just on the disgruntled person.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.260
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:02.260
(Applause)

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
It's not true. Authority, in fact,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
is essential to freedom.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Law is a human institution;

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
responsibility is a human institution.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
If the environmental agency can't decide

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that the power lines are good for the environment,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
to the city.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
A free society requires red lights and green lights,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
That's what's happened to America. Look around.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
What the world needs now

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
is to restore the authority to make common choices.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.260
It's the only way to get our freedom back,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
and it's the only way to release the energy and passion

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
needed so that we can meet the challenges

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
of our time. Thank you.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:16.260
(Applause)
