00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.023
For the last 50 years,

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:20.638
a lot of smart, well-resourced people --
some of you, no doubt --

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:23.964
have been trying to figure out
how to reduce poverty

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.207
in the United States.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.144
People have created and invested
millions of dollars

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.385
into non-profit organizations

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.599
with the mission of helping
people who are poor.

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.135
They've created think tanks

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.413
that study issues like education,
job creation and asset-building,

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:48.212
and then advocated for policies to support
our most marginalized communities.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:52.370
They've written books and columns
and given passionate speeches,

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:56.165
decrying the wealth gap
that is leaving more and more people

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.289
entrenched at the bottom end
of the income scale.

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.645
And that effort has helped.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.573
But it's not enough.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.834
Our poverty rates haven't changed
that much in the last 50 years,

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:09.961
since the War on Poverty was launched.

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:12.727
I'm here to tell you

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:18.178
that we have overlooked
the most powerful and practical resource.

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:20.485
Here it is:

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.202
people who are poor.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:27.394
Up in the left-hand corner
is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:29.934
They met when they all had small children,

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.795
through a parenting class
at a family resource center

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.003
in San Francisco.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.419
As they grew together
as parents and friends,

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:40.459
they talked a lot about how hard it was

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:42.705
to make money when your kids are little.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.411
Child care is expensive,

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:46.190
more than they'd earn in a job.

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:47.374
Their husbands worked,

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.874
but they wanted to contribute
financially, too.

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:51.637
So they hatched a plan.

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.546
They started a cleaning business.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.435
They plastered neighborhoods with flyers

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.332
and handed business cards out
to their families and friends,

00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:01.240
and soon, they had clients calling.

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:04.662
Two of them would clean
the office or house

00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:06.552
and one of them would watch the kids.

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:09.491
They'd rotate who'd cleaned
and who'd watch the kids.

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:11.728
(Laughs) It's awesome, right?

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:12.966
(Laughter)

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.842
And they split the money three ways.

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.167
It was not a full-time gig,

00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:18.422
no one could watch
the little ones all day.

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:20.960
But it made a difference
for their families.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.076
Extra money to pay for bills
when a husband's work hours were cut.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.378
Money to buy the kids clothes
as they were growing.

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:32.321
A little extra money in their pockets

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.839
to make them feel some independence.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.992
Up in the top-right corner
is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:40.931
Brianna is one of those kids

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:45.765
with this sparkly, infectious,
outgoing personality.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.501
For example, when Rosie,

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.681
a little girl who spoke only Spanish,
moved in next door,

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:52.853
Brianna, who spoke only English,

00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:56.462
borrowed her mother's tablet
and found a translation app

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.266
so the two of them could communicate.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.392
(Laughter)

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:00.598
I know, right?

00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:04.525
Rosie's family credits Brianna
with helping Rosie to learn English.

00:03:05.192 --> 00:03:07.077
A few years ago,

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:09.888
Brianna started to struggle academically.

00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:14.727
She was growing frustrated
and kind of withdrawn

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:16.999
and acting out in class.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:20.853
And her mother was heartbroken
over what was happening.

00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:24.959
Then they found out that she was going
to have to repeat second grade

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:26.996
and Brianna was devastated.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.191
Her mother felt hopeless
and overwhelmed and alone

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:35.719
because she knew that her daughter
was not getting the support she needed,

00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:37.681
and she did not know how to help her.

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:41.269
One afternoon, Theresa was catching up
with a group of friends,

00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:42.852
and one of them said,

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.812
"Theresa, how are you?"

00:03:45.344 --> 00:03:47.058
And she burst into tears.

00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:51.145
After she shared her story,
one of her friends said,

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.446
"I went through the exact same thing
with my son about a year ago."

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.621
And in that moment,

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:57.902
Theresa realized
that so much of her struggle

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:00.428
was not having anybody
to talk with about it.

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:04.331
So she created a support group
for parents like her.

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:08.435
The first meeting was her
and two other people.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.500
But word spread, and soon
20 people, 30 people

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:14.899
were showing up for these
monthly meetings that she put together.

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:17.140
She went from feeling helpless

00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:20.793
to realizing how capable she was
of supporting her daughter,

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:24.498
with the support of other people
who were going through the same struggle.

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:27.559
And Brianna is doing fantastic --
she's doing great academically

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:28.760
and socially.

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:33.220
That in the middle is my man Baakir,

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:36.089
standing in front of
BlackStar Books and Caffe,

00:04:36.113 --> 00:04:38.698
which he runs out of part of his house.

00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:40.297
As you walk in the door,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.705
Baakir greets you
with a "Welcome black home."

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.507
(Laughter)

00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:50.574
Once inside, you can order
some Algiers jerk chicken,

00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:53.121
perhaps a vegan walnut burger,

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:55.495
or jive turkey sammich.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.412
And that's sammich -- not sandwich.

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:02.667
You must finish your meal
with a buttermilk drop,

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:05.049
which is several steps above a donut hole

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:07.760
and made from a very secret family recipe.

00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:11.014
For real, it's very secret,
he won't tell you about it.

00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:14.697
But BlackStar is much more than a cafÃ©.

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:16.651
For the kids in the neighborhood,

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.680
it's a place to go after school
to get help with homework.

00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:21.497
For the grown-ups, it's where they go

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.724
to find out what's going on
in the neighborhood

00:05:23.748 --> 00:05:25.105
and catch up with friends.

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.606
It's a performance venue.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.960
It's a home for poets,
musicians and artists.

00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:32.608
Baakir and his partner Nicole,

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.772
with their baby girl strapped to her back,

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:36.350
are there in the mix of it all,

00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:38.445
serving up a cup of coffee,

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.609
teaching a child how to play Mancala,

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.688
or painting a sign
for an upcoming community event.

00:05:44.182 --> 00:05:48.428
I have worked with and learned
from people just like them

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.093
for more than 20 years.

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:52.960
I have organized
against the prison system,

00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.317
which impacts poor folks,

00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:57.885
especially black, indigenous
and Latino folks,

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.337
at an alarming rate.

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:03.273
I have worked with young people
who manifest hope and promise,

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:07.706
despite being at the effect of racist
discipline practices in their schools,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.166
and police violence in their communities.

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.491
I have learned from families

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:16.197
who are unleashing
their ingenuity and tenacity

00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.411
to collectively create
their own solutions.

00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:20.539
And they're not just focused on money.

00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:24.607
They're addressing education,
housing, health, community --

00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:26.829
the things that we all care about.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.643
Everywhere I go,

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:32.801
I see people who are broke but not broken.

00:06:33.263 --> 00:06:37.082
I see people who are struggling
to realize their good ideas,

00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:39.674
so that they can create
a better life for themselves,

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:42.236
their families, their communities.

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:49.804
Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa
and Baakir are the rule,

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:51.444
not the shiny exception.

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.253
I am the exception.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.109
I was raised by a quietly fierce
single mother in Rochester, New York.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.567
I was bussed to a school
in the suburbs, from a neighborhood

00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.478
that many of my classmates
and their parents considered dangerous.

00:07:06.502 --> 00:07:08.497
At eight, I was a latchkey kid.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:13.341
I'd get myself home after school every day
and do homework and chores,

00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:15.351
and wait for my mother to come home.

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.567
After school, I'd go to the corner store

00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.093
and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,

00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:22.740
which I'd heat up on the stove
as my afternoon snack.

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:25.952
If I had a little extra money,
I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:26.977
(Laughter)

00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:28.152
Cherry.

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:29.830
Not as good as a buttermilk drop.

00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:30.855
(Laughter)

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.573
We were poor when I was a kid.

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.390
But now, I own a home
in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.943
in Oakland, California.

00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:40.010
I've built a career.

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.820
My husband is a business owner.

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.369
I have a retirement account.

00:07:46.305 --> 00:07:48.882
My daughter is not even allowed
to turn on the stove

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:50.485
unless there's a grown-up at home

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:51.667
and she doesn't have to,

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.954
because she does not have to have
the same kind of self-reliance

00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:56.771
that I had to at her age.

00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.999
My kids' raviolis are organic

00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:01.930
and full of things
like spinach and ricotta,

00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:04.277
because I have the luxury of choice

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.219
when it comes to what my children eat.

00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:08.343
I am the exception,

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:10.699
not because I'm more talented than Baakir

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:14.605
or my mother worked any harder
than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.586
or cared any more than Theresa.

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:22.501
Marginalized communities are full
of smart, talented people,

00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:24.839
hustling and working and innovating,

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:28.804
just like our most revered
and most rewarded CEOs.

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.461
They are full of people
tapping into their resilience

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:33.987
to get up every day,
get the kids off to school

00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:35.997
and go to jobs that don't pay enough,

00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.489
or get educations
that are putting them in debt.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.654
They are full of people applying
their savvy intelligence

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.065
to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:49.276
or balance a job and a side hustle
to make ends meet.

00:08:49.627 --> 00:08:53.402
They are full of people
doing for themselves and for others,

00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:56.930
whether it's picking up medication
for an elderly neighbor,

00:08:56.954 --> 00:09:00.688
or letting a sibling borrow some money
to pay the phone bill,

00:09:00.712 --> 00:09:02.955
or just watching out
for the neighborhood kids

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:04.187
from the front stoop.

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.646
I am the exception
because of luck and privilege,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.955
not hard work.

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:12.317
And I'm not being modest
or self-deprecating --

00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:13.492
I am amazing.

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:14.734
(Laughter)

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:16.372
But most people work hard.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.999
Hard work is the common
denominator in this equation,

00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:23.392
and I'm tired of the story we tell

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:26.024
that hard work leads to success,

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:27.585
because that allows --

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.799
Thank you.

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:32.314
(Applause)

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:38.122
... because that story allows those of us
who make it to believe we deserve it,

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:39.379
and by implication,

00:09:39.403 --> 00:09:41.636
those who don't make it don't deserve it.

00:09:42.175 --> 00:09:44.378
We tell ourselves,
in the back of our minds,

00:09:44.402 --> 00:09:46.677
and sometimes in the front of our mouths,

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:49.738
"There must be something a little wrong
with those poor people."

00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:51.254
We have a wide range of beliefs

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.463
about what that something wrong is.

00:09:53.487 --> 00:09:56.771
Some people tell the story
that poor folks are lazy freeloaders

00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:59.977
who would cheat and lie
to get out of an honest day's work.

00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:03.200
Others prefer the story
that poor people are helpless

00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:06.505
and probably had neglectful parents
that didn't read to them enough,

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:08.738
and if they were just told what to do

00:10:08.762 --> 00:10:10.019
and shown the right path,

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:11.284
they could make it.

00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:18.056
For every story I hear demonizing
low-income single mothers

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.429
or absentee fathers,

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:22.195
which is how people
might think of my parents,

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:27.081
I've got 50 that tell a different story
about the same people,

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:30.015
showing up every day and doing their best.

00:10:30.491 --> 00:10:34.207
I'm not saying that some
of the negative stories aren't true,

00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:40.595
but those stories allow us
to not really see who people really are,

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:42.806
because they don't paint a full picture.

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:47.098
The quarter-truths and limited
plot lines have us convinced

00:10:47.122 --> 00:10:50.380
that poor people are a problem
that needs fixing.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.839
What if we recognized
that what's working is the people

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.417
and what's broken is our approach?

00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.966
What if we realized that the experts
we are looking for,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.786
the experts we need to follow,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.731
are poor people themselves?

00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:08.758
What if, instead of imposing solutions,

00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:10.881
we just added fire

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:13.849
to the already-burning flame
that they have?

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:16.030
Not directing --

00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:18.644
not even empowering --

00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:20.897
but just fueling their initiative.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.357
Just north of here,

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:26.548
we have an example
of what this could look like:

00:11:26.572 --> 00:11:27.822
Silicon Valley.

00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:32.671
A whole venture capital industry
has grown up around the belief

00:11:32.695 --> 00:11:36.983
that if people have good ideas
and the desire to manifest them,

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:41.004
we should give them lots
and lots and lots of money.

00:11:41.028 --> 00:11:42.150
(Laughter)

00:11:42.174 --> 00:11:46.015
Right? But where is our strategy
for Theresa and Baakir?

00:11:47.127 --> 00:11:49.423
There are no incubators for them,

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.156
no accelerators, no fellowships.

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:56.252
How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
really all that different

00:11:56.276 --> 00:11:58.914
from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?

00:11:58.938 --> 00:12:01.922
Baakir has experience and a track record.

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:03.655
I'd put my money on him.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:11.405
So, consider this an invitation
to rethink a flawed strategy.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.960
Let's grasp this opportunity

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.801
to let go of a tired, faulty narrative

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:21.862
and listen and look for true stories,

00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.899
more beautifully complex stories,

00:12:23.923 --> 00:12:28.768
about who marginalized people
and families and communities are.

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:34.272
I'm going to take a minute
to speak to my people.

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.446
We cannot wait

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.850
for somebody else to get it right.

00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:48.292
Let us remember what we are capable of;

00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:52.185
all that we have built
with blood, sweat and dreams;

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:53.988
all the cogs that keep turning;

00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:57.684
and the people kept afloat
because of our backbreaking work.

00:12:57.708 --> 00:13:00.066
Let us remember that we are magic.

00:13:00.677 --> 00:13:03.597
If you need some inspiration
to jog your memory,

00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:06.591
read Octavia Butler's
"Parable of the Sower."

00:13:06.615 --> 00:13:10.004
Listen to Reverend King's
"Letter from Birmingham Jail."

00:13:10.028 --> 00:13:14.648
Listen to Suheir Hammad recite
"First Writing Since,"

00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:17.721
or Esperanza Spalding
perform "Black Gold."

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:20.393
Set your gaze upon the art
of Kehinde Wiley

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:22.271
or Favianna Rodriguez.

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:28.499
Look at the hands of your grandmother

00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:31.195
or into the eyes of someone who loves you.

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:34.254
We are magic.

00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:37.957
Individually, we don't have
a lot of wealth and power,

00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:41.488
but collectively, we are unstoppable.

00:13:42.114 --> 00:13:44.385
And we spend a lot of our time and energy

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:50.608
organizing our power to demand change
from systems that were not made for us.

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:55.070
Instead of trying to alter
the fabric of existing ways,

00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:57.871
let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.

00:13:58.355 --> 00:14:01.845
Let's use some of our
substantial collective power

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:03.841
toward inventing and bringing to life

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:06.812
new ways of being that work for us.

00:14:07.423 --> 00:14:12.358
Desmond Tutu talks
about the concept of ubuntu,

00:14:12.382 --> 00:14:16.037
in the context of South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation process

00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:18.354
that they embarked on after apartheid.

00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:20.713
He says it means,

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:26.263
"My humanity is caught up,
is inextricably bound up, in yours;

00:14:26.287 --> 00:14:30.833
we belong to a bundle of life."

00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:34.568
A bundle of life.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:37.807
The Truth and Reconciliation process

00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:41.481
started by elevating
the voices of the unheard.

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:48.009
If this country is going to live up to its
promise of liberty and justice for all,

00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:51.122
then we need to elevate
the voices of our unheard,

00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:54.627
of people like Jobana,
Sintia and Bertha,

00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:57.118
Theresa and Baakir.

00:14:57.809 --> 00:15:00.794
We must leverage their solutions
and their ideas.

00:15:01.437 --> 00:15:04.567
We must listen to their true stories,

00:15:04.591 --> 00:15:07.241
their more beautifully complex stories.

00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:09.116
Thank you.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.984
(Applause)
