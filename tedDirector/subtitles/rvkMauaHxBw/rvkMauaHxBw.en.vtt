00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.126
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.371
a small and very beautiful country

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.076
in West Africa,

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:23.980
a country rich both in physical resources

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.312
and creative talent.

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:28.274
However, Sierra Leone is infamous

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:30.688
for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.778
when entire villages were burnt down.

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:37.990
An estimated 8,000 men, women and children

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.256
had their arms and legs amputated during this time.

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:45.240
As my family and I ran for safety

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.932
when I was about 12 from one of those attacks,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.364
I resolved that I would do everything I could

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:53.644
to ensure that my own children

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:57.030
would not go through the 
same experiences we had.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.644
They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:02.132
where war and amputation

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:06.838
were no longer a strategy for gaining power.

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:10.571
As I watched people who I knew, loved ones,

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.462
recover from this devastation,

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:15.126
one thing that deeply troubled me

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:17.630
was that many of the amputees in the country

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.686
would not use their prostheses.

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:21.642
The reason, I would come to find out,

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.977
was that their prosthetic sockets

00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:29.437
were painful because they did not fit well.

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.623
The prosthetic socket is the part

00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:35.019
in which the amputee inserts their residual limb,

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.299
and which connects to the prosthetic ankle.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.037
Even in the developed world,

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.529
it takes a period of three weeks to often years

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:46.791
for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.673
Prosthetists still use conventional processes

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:52.029
like molding and casting

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.747
to create single-material prosthetic sockets.

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:58.535
Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.363
of pressure on the limbs of the patient,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:05.663
leaving them with pressure sores and blisters.

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:07.775
It does not matter

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.997
how powerful your prosthetic ankle is.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.693
If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:15.265
you will not use your leg,

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:19.145
and that is just simply unacceptable in our age.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.565
So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr

00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:23.090
about two and a half years ago,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.577
and he asked me if I knew 
how to solve this problem,

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:27.677
I said, "No, not yet,

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:30.287
but I would love to figure it out."

00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:33.577
And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:36.470
I designed custom prosthetic sockets

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.377
quickly and cheaply

00:02:39.377 --> 00:02:41.232
that are more comfortable

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:44.229
than conventional prostheses.

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.471
I used magnetic resonance imaging

00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.360
to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.464
then use finite element modeling to better predict

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.407
the internal stresses and strains

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.405
on the normal forces,

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:02.018
and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.

00:03:02.018 --> 00:03:05.432
We use a 3D printer to create

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:09.248
a multi-material prosthetic socket

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:11.714
which relieves pressure where needed

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:15.246
on the anatomy of the patient.

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:18.177
In short, we're using data

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:21.976
to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:23.772
In a recent trial we just wrapped up

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:25.534
at the Media Lab,

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:28.044
one of our patients, a U.S. veteran

00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:30.970
who has been an amputee for about 20 years

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.052
and worn dozens of legs,

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:38.140
said of one of our printed parts,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.544
"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,

00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:44.480
and it's effing sexy."

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.198
(Laughter)

00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:51.474
Disability in our age

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:53.107
should not prevent anyone

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.970
from living meaningful lives.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.313
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:01.311
we develop in our research group

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.249
can be used to bring highly functional prostheses

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.540
to those who need them.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.991
For me, a place to begin healing the souls

00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:15.880
of those affected by war and disease

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.629
is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.585
for their bodies.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:24.813
Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:28.419
I hope this not only restores

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.680
but indeed transforms their
sense of human potential.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.591
Thank you very much.

00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:38.540
(Applause)
