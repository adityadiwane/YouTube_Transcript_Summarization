00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.931
I was 10 years old when I learned
what the word "genocide" meant.

00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:20.279
It was 2003,

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:24.405
and my people were being brutally
attacked because of their race --

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.233
hundreds of thousands murdered,

00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:28.205
millions displaced,

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.528
a nation torn apart at the hands
of its own government.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.209
My mother and father immediately began
speaking out against the crisis.

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.719
I didn't really understand it,

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.589
except for the fact
that it was destroying my parents.

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:44.924
One day, I walked in on my mother crying,

00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:49.595
and I asked her why
we are burying so many people.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.923
I don't remember the words that she chose

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:57.184
to describe genocide to her
10-year-old daughter,

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:58.837
but I remember the feeling.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:02.616
We felt completely alone,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.558
as if no one could hear us,

00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:07.391
as if we were essentially invisible.

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.208
This is when I wrote
my first poem about Darfur.

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:17.952
I wrote poetry to convince people
to hear and see us,

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.446
and that's how I learned
the thing that changed me.

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.907
It's easy to be seen.

00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:28.041
I mean, look at me -- I'm a young
African woman with a scarf around my head,

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.228
an American accent on my tongue

00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:34.610
and a story that makes even the most
brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.454
But it's hard to convince people
that they deserve to be seen.

00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.972
I learned this in my high school
classroom one day,

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.871
when my teacher asked me
to give a presentation about Darfur.

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:49.790
I was setting up the projector
when a classmate of mine said,

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.909
"Why do you have to talk about this?

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.983
Can't you think about us
and how it will make us feel?"

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.147
(Laughter)

00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:01.235
My 14-year-old self didn't know
what to say to her,

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.121
or how to explain the pain
that I felt in that moment,

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:09.216
and in every moment that we were forced
not to talk about "this."

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.084
Her words took me back to the days
and nights on the ground in Darfur,

00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:16.562
where we were forced to remain silent;

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:18.777
where we didn't speak over morning tea

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:23.254
because the warplanes overhead
would swallow any and all noise;

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:25.401
back to the days when we were told

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:28.214
not only that we don't
deserve to be heard

00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:31.054
but that we do not have a right to exist.

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.262
And this is where the magic happened,

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.509
in that classroom when all the students
started taking their seats

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.802
and I began to speak,

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:42.565
despite this renewed feeling
that I didn't deserve to be there,

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.029
that I didn't belong there

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.431
or have a right to break the silence.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.614
As I talked,

00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:51.281
and my classmates listened,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.775
the fear ebbed away.

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:55.419
My mind became calm,

00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:57.120
and I felt safe.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:01.513
It was the sound of our grieving,

00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:04.260
the feel of their arms around me,

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.565
the steady walls that held us together.

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:09.677
It felt nothing like a vacuum.

00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:13.897
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.

00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:17.951
When someone is standing in front of you,
mind, body and soul,

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:19.176
saying "Witness me,"

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.014
it's impossible not to become
keenly aware of your own humanity.

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:25.213
This changed everything for me.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:26.783
It gave me courage.

00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:30.294
Every day I experience
the power of witness,

00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:32.419
and because of that, I am whole.

00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:33.925
And so now I ask:

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.315
Will you witness me?

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:39.255
They hand me the microphone

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.580
as my shoulders sink
under the weight of this stress.

00:03:44.163 --> 00:03:46.121
The woman says,

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.586
"The one millionth refugee
just left South Sudan.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.067
Can you comment?"

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:54.111
I feel my feet rock back and forth
on the heels my mother bought,

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:55.313
begging the question:

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.087
Do we stay, or is it safer
to choose flight?

00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:00.897
My mind echoes the numbers:

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.224
one million gone,

00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:04.870
two million displaced,

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.614
400,000 dead in Darfur.

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.344
And this lump takes over my throat,

00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:11.990
as if each of those bodies
just found a grave

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:13.947
right here in my esophagus.

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:15.564
Our once country,

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.818
all north and south and east and west,

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:20.760
so restless the Nile couldn't
hold us together,

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:22.643
and you ask me to summarize.

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:26.209
They talk about the numbers
as if this isn't still happening,

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.450
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:32.368
as if 3,000 aren't still making
their final stand

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:35.556
at the bottom of the Mediterranean,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.319
as if there aren't entire volumes
full of fact sheets about our genocides,

00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:42.197
and now they want me to write one.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.237
Fact:

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:47.965
we never talked over breakfast,

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:50.704
because the warplanes
would swallow our voices.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:52.306
Fact:

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.794
my grandfather didn't want to leave home,

00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:56.847
so he died in a war zone.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:04:58.807
Fact:

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.906
a burning bush without God is just a fire.

00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:04.658
I measure the distance between what I know

00:05:04.682 --> 00:05:06.932
and what is safe to say on a microphone.

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:09.850
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?

00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.267
Do I mention the violence,

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:13.971
how it's never as simple
as what you see on TV,

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.813
how there are weeks' worth of fear
before the camera is on?

00:05:19.474 --> 00:05:22.094
Do I tell her about our bodies,

00:05:22.118 --> 00:05:23.569
how they are 60 percent water,

00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:25.510
but we still burn like driftwood,

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:27.416
making fuel of our sacrifice?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.548
Do I tell her the men died first,
mothers forced to watch the slaughter?

00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:33.174
That they came for our children,

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:36.352
scattering them across the continent
until our homes sank?

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:39.505
That even castles sink
at the bite of the bomb?

00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:43.460
Do I talk about the elderly,

00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:45.119
our heroes,

00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:47.754
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,

00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:49.161
how they would march them,

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:51.432
hands raised, rifles at their backs,

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:52.612
into the fire?

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:54.906
How their walking sticks
kept the flames alive?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.114
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires
and an audience to swallow.

00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:01.574
Too relentless,

00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:05.457
like the valley that filled
with the putrid smoke of our deaths.

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.314
Is it better in verse?

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.635
Can a stanza become a burial shroud?

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.490
Will it sting less if I say it softly?

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:14.817
If you don't see me cry,
will you listen better?

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.957
Will the pain leave
when the microphone does?

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:20.175
Why does every word feel
as if I'm saying my last?

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:24.243
Thirty seconds for the sound bite,

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:26.367
and now three minutes for the poem.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.204
My tongue goes dry the same way we died,

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:34.420
becoming ash, having never been coal.

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:38.417
I feel my left leg go numb,

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.298
and I realize that I locked my knees,

00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:42.910
bracing for impact.

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:46.581
I never wear shoes I can't run in.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.307
Thank you.

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:55.902
(Applause)

00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:00.904
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:04.404
because that's the paradox
that this life has been:

00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:07.428
in the places where I learned
to cry the most,

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:10.768
I also learned how to smile after.

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:13.942
So, here goes.

00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:19.511
"You Have a Big Imagination

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.422
or

00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:25.082
400,000 Ways to Cry."

00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:27.405
For Zeinab.

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:30.112
I am a sad girl,

00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:33.830
but my face makes other plans,

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:38.676
focusing energy on this smile,
so as not to waste it on pain.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.223
The first thing they took was my sleep,

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:43.565
eyes heavy but wide open,

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.613
thinking maybe I missed something,

00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:47.811
maybe the cavalry is still coming.

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:49.080
They didn't come,

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.916
so I bought bigger pillows.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.243
(Laughter)

00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:57.032
My grandmother could cure anything

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:59.643
by talking the life out of it.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.932
And she said that I could make
a thief in a silo laugh

00:08:02.956 --> 00:08:05.036
in the middle of our raging war.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.482
War makes a broken marriage bed
out of sorrow.

00:08:10.018 --> 00:08:12.199
You want nothing more than to disappear,

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:15.956
but your heart can't salvage
enough remnants to leave.

00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:18.012
But joy --

00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:22.363
joy is the armor we carried across
the borders of our broken homeland.

00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:28.059
A hasty mix of stories and faces

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:30.907
that lasts long after the flavor is gone.

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:35.748
A muscle memory that overcomes
even the most bitter of times,

00:08:35.772 --> 00:08:40.321
my memory is spotted with
days of laughing until I cried,

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:41.980
or crying until I laughed.

00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:45.973
Laughter and tears are both
involuntary human reactions,

00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:49.170
testaments to our capacity for expression.

00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:51.027
So allow me to express

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.741
that if I make you laugh,

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.844
it's usually on purpose.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.595
And if I make you cry,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.598
I'll still think you are beautiful.

00:08:59.087 --> 00:09:01.782
This is for my cousin Zeinab,

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:05.530
bedridden on a random afternoon.

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:09.977
I hadn't seen her since the last time
we were in Sudan together,

00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:13.955
and there I was at her hospital bedside

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:17.337
in a 400-year-old building in France.

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:21.112
Zeinab wanted to hear poems.

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:26.049
Suddenly, English, Arabic
and French were not enough.

00:09:26.073 --> 00:09:29.460
Every word I knew became empty noise,

00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:31.758
and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it."

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:32.859
(Laughter)

00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:36.045
And I read her everything that I could,

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:37.405
and we laughed,

00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:38.585
and we loved it,

00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:42.584
and it was the most important stage
that I've ever stood on,

00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:44.419
surrounded by family,

00:09:44.443 --> 00:09:49.219
by remnants of a people who were given
as a dowry to a relentless war

00:09:49.243 --> 00:09:52.699
but still managed
to make pearls of this life;

00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:56.439
by the ones who taught me
to not only laugh,

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:59.333
but to live in the face of death;

00:09:59.357 --> 00:10:01.763
who placed their hands across the sky,

00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:05.154
measuring the distance to the sun
and saying, "Smile;

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:06.833
I'm gonna meet you there."

00:10:07.618 --> 00:10:09.198
And for Zeinab --

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:13.513
Zeinab, who taught me love
in a place like France,

00:10:14.244 --> 00:10:18.809
Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar
poems on her deathbed --

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:22.714
Dilated fibromyalgia.

00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:25.836
Her heart muscles expanded

00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:28.359
until they couldn't function.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.883
And she held me,
and she made me feel like gold.

00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:34.452
And I said, "Zeinab,

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.821
isn't it strange that your only problem

00:10:38.845 --> 00:10:41.729
is that your heart was too big?"

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.439
Thank you.

00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:50.248
(Applause)
