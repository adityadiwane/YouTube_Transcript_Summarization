00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:15.101
Let me start by asking you a
question, just with a show of hands:

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.236
Who has an iPhone?

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:20.326
Who has an Android phone?

00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:22.394
Who has a Blackberry?

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.768
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:27.351
(Laughter)

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.439
And let me guess, how many of you,

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.447
when you arrived here, like me, went and bought

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:35.237
a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:36.637
I'll bet you didn't even know

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.615
you're using African technology.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.898
Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:43.968
pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:46.371
a good 15 years ago,

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.916
and now, like franchising,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.199
pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.776
of economic activity in the world.

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:55.668
So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,

00:00:55.668 --> 00:00:57.738
which I think is the purest form,

00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.746
innovation out of necessity.

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:02.208
But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:03.843
You don't have to put your hands up.

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:06.475
These are rhetorical.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:08.745
Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:10.746
the alternating current that powers the lights

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:13.277
in this building or the city that we're in?

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.965
Why did Henry Ford have to
invent the production line

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:18.582
to produce these Fords that came in anything

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:20.043
as long as they were black?

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:24.822
And why did Eric Merrifield
have to invent the dolos?

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:27.420
Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.241
and in the background, you can see Robben Island.

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:34.290
This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.053
is the most famous inventor you've never heard of.

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:41.273
In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:43.645
in a small South African town called East London,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.688
and while he was watching his kids playing

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:49.234
with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.856
he had the idea for this.

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:53.073
It's a bit like a huge jumping jack,

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:56.515
and they have used this in every harbor in the world

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.135
as a breakwater.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:01.324
The global shipping economy would not be possible

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:04.224
without African technology like this.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.973
So whenever you talk about Africa,

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.900
you have to put up this picture
of the world from space,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.727
and people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent."

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:16.386
Actually, it isn't.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.415
What it is is a map of innovation.

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:21.900
And it's really easy to see
where innovation's going on.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.960
All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.987
(Laughter)

00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:33.520
(Applause)

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.970
And the reason it isn't is because everybody's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.155
watching television or playing Angry Birds.

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:42.624
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:45.828
So where it's happening is in Africa.

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.646
Now, this is real innovation,

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.801
not the way people have expropriated the word

00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:52.994
to talk about launching new products.

00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:56.751
This is real innovation, and I
define it as problem-solving.

00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.315
People are solving real problems in Africa.

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:01.581
Why? Because we have to.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.314
Because we have real problems.

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:05.910
And when we solve real problems for people,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.307
we solve them for the rest of the world

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.411
at the same time.

00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.746
So in California, everybody's really excited

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.752
about a little square of plastic
that you plug into a phone

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.443
and you can swipe your credit card,

00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:21.322
and people say, "We've liberated the credit card

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:23.996
from the point of sale terminal."

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:27.410
Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.758
In Africa, we've been doing that for years,

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:32.760
and we've been doing it on phones like this.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.294
This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,

00:03:35.294 --> 00:03:37.243
about an hour south of Nairobi,

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:40.123
and the thing that's so remarkable
about the payment system

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:42.325
that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:45.069
is that it works on phones like this.

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.835
It works on every single phone possible,

00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:50.653
because it uses SMS.

00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:53.551
You can pay bills with it, 
you can buy your groceries,

00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:55.549
you can pay your kids' school fees,

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.582
and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.063
(Laughter)

00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:04.055
Something like 25 million dollars a day

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.226
is transacted through M-Pesa.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.537
Forty percent of Kenya's GDP

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:11.738
moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.

00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:13.828
And you think this is just a feature phone.

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:16.900
Actually it's the smartphone of Africa.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.359
It's also a radio, and it's also a torch,

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.771
and more than anything else,

00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:23.539
it has really superb battery life.

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.641
Why? Because that's what we need.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:29.054
We have really severe energy problems in Africa.

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.599
By the way, you can update Facebook

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.272
and send Gmail from a phone like this.

00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:36.852
So we have found a way to use

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.745
the available technology to send money via M-Pesa,

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.766
which is a bit like a check system

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.008
for the mobile age.

00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:46.630
I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.094
It's built on gold.

00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:50.383
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.

00:04:50.383 --> 00:04:55.748
And the difference today is that 
the gold of today is mobile.

00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:59.991
If you think about the railroad system
in North America and how that worked,

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:01.873
first came the infrastructure,

00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:05.153
then came the industry around it, the brothels --

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:07.145
it's a bit like the Internet today, right? â€”

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:09.613
and everything else that worked with it:

00:05:09.613 --> 00:05:11.680
bars, saloons, etc.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.898
The gold of today is mobile,

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:16.919
and mobile is the enabler
that makes all of this possible.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.945
So what are some of the
things that you can do with it?

00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:22.531
Well, this is by a guy called
Bright Simons from Ghana,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.945
and what you do is you take medication,

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:28.183
something that some people might
spend their entire month's salary on,

00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:30.948
and you scratch off the code,

00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:32.890
and you send that to an SMS number,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.885
and it tells you if that is legitimate

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:36.675
or if it's expired.

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:40.244
Really simple, really effective, really life-saving.

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:42.433
In Kenya, there's a service called iCow,

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:45.372
which just sends you really important information

00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:47.250
about how to look after your dairy.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.791
The dairy business in Kenya

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.597
is a $463 million business,

00:05:51.597 --> 00:05:54.214
and the difference between a subsistence farmer

00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:55.911
and an abundance farmer

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:58.285
is only a couple of liters of milk a day.

00:05:58.285 --> 00:06:01.305
And if you can do that,
you can rise out of poverty.

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:05.276
Really simple, using a basic phone.

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:08.061
If you don't have electricity, no problem!

00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.022
We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts

00:06:10.022 --> 00:06:12.506
using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.586
There's another great African that you've heard

00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:18.318
that's busy disrupting the
automobile industry in the world.

00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:21.077
He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power

00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:23.848
and the electricity industry in North America,

00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:26.931
and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,

00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.796
hopefully in my lifetime.

00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:31.879
He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.815
about 50 kilometers from where I live.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:38.397
So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.546
which means City of Gold.

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:44.557
And not only is mobile the gold of today,

00:06:44.557 --> 00:06:46.927
I don't believe that the gold is under the ground.

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:48.659
I believe we are the gold.

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.003
Like you've heard the other economists say,

00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:53.035
we are at the point where China was

00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:55.468
when its boom years began,

00:06:55.468 --> 00:06:56.838
and that's where we're going.

00:06:56.838 --> 00:07:01.826
So, you hear the West talk
about innovation at the edge.

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:03.735
Well, of course it's happening at the edge,

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:06.732
because in the middle,
everybody's updating Facebook,

00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:08.731
or worse still, they're trying to understand

00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:10.858
Facebook's privacy settings.

00:07:10.858 --> 00:07:12.762
(Laughter)

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:15.308
This is not that catchy catchphrase.

00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:19.210
This is innovation over the edge.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.176
So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.850
but actually it's mobile-only,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.495
so while everybody else is doing all of those things,

00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:31.835
we're solving the world's problems.

00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:34.158
So there's only one thing left to say.

00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:36.638
["You're welcome"] (Laughter)

00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:43.161
(Applause)
