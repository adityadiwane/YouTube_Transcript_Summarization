00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.474
Thank you.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:15.983
I have only got 18 minutes

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.832
to explain something 
that lasts for hours and days,

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:21.102
so I'd better get started.

00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:25.959
Let's start with a clip
from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.496
Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that 
gets relatively little media coverage.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.487
Even the elections this past week
passed without much drama.

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:36.145
And that's the Norwegian
media in a nutshell:

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:37.622
not much drama.

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:38.959
A few years back,

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.416
Norway's public TV channel NRK

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.593
decided to broadcast live coverage
of a seven-hour train ride --

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:47.894
seven hours of simple footage,

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.123
a train rolling down the tracks.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:53.985
Norwegians, more than a million of them
according to the ratings, loved it.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.901
A new kind of reality TV show was born,

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.036
and it goes against all the rules
of TV engagement.

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.476
There is no story line, no script,

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:04.519
no drama, no climax,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.443
and it's called Slow TV.

00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:07.915
For the past two months,

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.507
Norwegians have been watching 
a cruise ship's journey up the coast,

00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:13.566
and there's a lot of fog on that coast.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.639
Executives at Norway's
National Broadcasting Service

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.729
are now considering broadcasting
a night of knitting nationwide.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210
On the surface, it sounds boring,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.510
because it is,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.600
but something about this TV experiment

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.458
has gripped Norwegians.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:31.615
So we sent the Listening Post's
Marcela Pizarro to Oslo

00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:34.146
to find out what it is,
but first a warning:

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:38.649
Viewers may find some of the images
in the following report disappointing.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.664
(Laughter)

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:43.550
Thomas Hellum: And then follows
an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.876
about some strange
TV programs in little Norway.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:49.934
Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.954
We have to go back to 2009,

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:53.953
when one of my colleagues
got a great idea.

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:55.756
Where do you get your ideas?

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:57.237
In the lunchroom.

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.714
So he said, why don't we make
a radio program

00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:04.299
marking the day of the German invasion
of Norway in 1940.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.343
We tell the story at the exact time
during the night.

00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:10.507
Wow. Brilliant idea, except

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:13.410
this was just a couple of weeks
before the invasion day.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.755
So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:19.963
what other stories
can you tell as they evolve?

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:24.101
What other things take a really long time?

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.737
So one of us came up with a train.

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:30.729
The Bergen Railway had its 
100-year anniversary that year

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.424
It goes from western Norway
to eastern Norway,

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:37.587
and it takes exactly the same time
as it did 40 years ago,

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:40.785
over seven hours. (Laughter)

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.771
So we caught our commissioning editors 
in Oslo, and we said,

00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:46.758
we want to make a documentary
about the Bergen Railway,

00:02:46.758 --> 00:02:48.710
and we want to make it in full length,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.064
and the answer was,

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:51.999
"Yes, but how long will the program be?"

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.857
"Oh," we said, "full length."

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.349
"Yes, but we mean the program."

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.456
And back and forth.

00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:02.943
Luckily for us, they met us with laughter,
very, very good laughter,

00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:05.629
so one bright day in September,

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.615
we started a program that we thought
should be seven hours and four minutes.

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:12.479
Actually, it turned out
to be seven hours and 14 minutes

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.983
due to a signal failure
at the last station.

00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:18.957
We had four cameras,

00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:22.263
three of them pointing out
to the beautiful nature.

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:26.233
Some talking to the guests,
some information.

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:30.283
(Video) Train announcement: 
We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.

00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:31.651
TH: And that's about it,

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:33.446
but of course, also

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:37.287
the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity
to do some archives.

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:41.183
Narrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of
flirting while the food is digested.

00:03:42.483 --> 00:03:46.831
The last downhill stretch
before we reach our destination.

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:51.257
We pass Mjølfjell Station.

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:54.615
Then a new tunnel.

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:55.765
(Laughter)

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:59.022
TH: And now we thought, yes,
we have a brilliant program.

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:03.619
It will fit for the 2,000
train spotters in Norway.

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.220
We brought it on air in November 2009.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.667
But no, this was far more attractive.

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:12.489
This is the five biggest TV channels
in Norway on a normal Friday,

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.788
and if you look at NRK2 over here,

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:18.184
look what happened when they put on
the Bergen Railway show:

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:22.709
1.2 million Norwegians
watched part of this program.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.034
(Applause)

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:28.810
And another funny thing:

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.757
When the host on our main channel,

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.224
after they have got news for you,

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:35.662
she said, "And on our second channel,

00:04:35.662 --> 00:04:38.657
the train has now
nearly reached Myrdal station."

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:41.350
Thousands of people
just jumped on the train

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.366
on our second channel like this.
(Laughter)

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:49.012
This was also a huge success
in terms of social media.

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:53.116
It was so nice to see all the thousands
of Facebook and Twitter users

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:55.977
discussing the same view,

00:04:55.977 --> 00:05:00.463
talking to each other as if they were
on the same train together.

00:05:00.463 --> 00:05:03.748
And especially, I like this one.
It's a 76-year-old man.

00:05:03.748 --> 00:05:05.428
He's watched all the program,

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:09.445
and at the end station, he rises up
to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,

00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:13.003
and his head hit the curtain rod,

00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:15.691
and he realized he is
in his own living room.

00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:20.219
(Applause)

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:26.070
So that's strong and living TV.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.414
Four hundred and thirty-six
minute by minute on a Friday night,

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:31.275
and during that first night,

00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:33.829
the first Twitter message came:
Why be a chicken?

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:39.498
Why stop at 436
when you can expand that

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:43.159
to 8,040, minute by minute,

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.365
and do the iconic journey in Norway,

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:48.807
the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten
from Bergen to Kirkenes,

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:52.361
almost 3,000 kilometers,
covering most of our coast.

00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:56.939
It has 120-year-old,
very interesting history,

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.755
and literally takes part in life
and death along the coast.

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:04.126
So just a week after the Bergen Railway,

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:08.872
we called the Hurtigruten company
and we started planning for our next show.

00:06:10.082 --> 00:06:12.245
We wanted to do something different.

00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:15.526
The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.

00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:17.616
So when we sat in our editing room,

00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:20.220
we watched this picture --
it's all Ål Station --

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.728
we saw this journalist.

00:06:21.728 --> 00:06:23.681
We had called him, we had spoken to him,

00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:25.537
and when we left the station,

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:28.728
he took this picture of us
and he waved to the camera,

00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:30.188
and we thought,

00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:33.440
what if more people knew
that we were on board that train?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.286
Would more people show up?

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.259
What would it look like?

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.789
So we decided our next project,
it should be live.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.694
We wanted this picture of us on the fjord
and on the screen at the same time.

00:06:47.034 --> 00:06:50.355
So this is not the first time
NRK had been on board a ship.

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:52.073
This is back in 1964,

00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:54.929
when the technical managers
have suits and ties

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:58.969
and NRK rolled all its equipment
on board a ship,

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:03.009
and 200 meters out of the shore,
transmitting the signal back,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.957
and in the machine room,
they talked to the machine guy,

00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:11.110
and on the deck, they have
splendid entertainment.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.289
So being on a ship, 
it's not the first time.

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:22.335
But five and a half days in a row,
and live, we wanted some help.

00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:26.498
And we asked our viewers out there,
what do you want to see?

00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:30.610
What do you want us to film?
How do you want this to look?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.318
Do you want us to make a website?
What do you want on it?

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.556
And we got some answers
from you out there,

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:39.807
and it helped us a very lot
to build the program.

00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:42.662
So in June 2011,

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:46.446
23 of us went on board
the Hurtigruten coastal ship

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:48.164
and we set off.

00:07:48.164 --> 00:07:51.996
(Music)

00:08:47.373 --> 00:08:51.092
I have some really strong memories
from that week, and it's all about people.

00:08:51.092 --> 00:08:52.732
This guy, for instance,

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.425
he's head of research
at the University in Tromsø

00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:57.188
(Laughter)

00:08:57.188 --> 00:09:02.071
And I will show you a piece of cloth,

00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:05.298
this one.

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:07.922
It's the other strong memory.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.776
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.

00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:20.818
And it's people like those two
who took a firm grip of our program,

00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:24.639
and together with thousands
of others along the route,

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.519
they made the program what it became.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.047
They made all the stories.

00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:33.091
This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.

00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.713
It says, "I will be a little
late for school tomorrow."

00:09:36.713 --> 00:09:39.383
He was supposed to be
in the school at 8 a.m.

00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:42.484
He came at 9 a.m., and he didn't
get a note from his teacher,

00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:44.585
because the teacher
had watched the program.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.046
(Laughter)

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.719
How did we do this?

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:50.935
Yes, we took a conference room
on board the Hurtigruten.

00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:54.047
We turned it into
a complete TV control room.

00:09:54.047 --> 00:09:57.100
We made it all work, of course,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.259
and then we took along 11 cameras.

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:00.374
This is one of them.

00:10:00.374 --> 00:10:02.347
This is my sketch from February,

00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:04.855
and when you give this sketch
to professional people

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:07.084
in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,

00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:10.024
you get some cool stuff back.

00:10:10.024 --> 00:10:13.631
And with some very creative solutions.

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:16.719
(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: 
Run it up and down.

00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:20.141
This is Norway's most
important drill right now.

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:26.054
It regulates the height of a bow
camera in NRK's live production,

00:10:26.054 --> 00:10:30.790
one of 11 that capture
great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.461
Eight wires keep the camera stable.

00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:37.106
Cameraman: I work 
on different camera solutions.

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:40.960
They're just tools
used in a different context.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.304
TH: Another camera is this one.
It's normally used for sports.

00:10:44.304 --> 00:10:47.903
It made it possible for us to take
close-up pictures of people

00:10:47.903 --> 00:10:49.923
100 kilomteres away,

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:54.358
like this one. (Laughter)

00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:57.190
People called us and asked,
how is this man doing?

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.139
He's doing fine. Everything went well.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.372
We also could take pictures of
people waving at us,

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.689
people along the route,
thousands of them,

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:08.114
and they all had a phone in their hand.

00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:11.099
And when you take a picture of them,
and they get the message,

00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:13.954
"Now we are on TV, dad,"
they start waving back.

00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:16.114
This was waving TV 
for five and a half days,

00:11:16.114 --> 00:11:18.273
and people get so extremely happy

00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:23.090
when they can send a warm message
to their loved ones.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.609
It was also a great success
on social media.

00:11:26.609 --> 00:11:29.418
On the last day, we met
Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:33.017
and Twitter couldn't quite handle it.

00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:35.386
And we also, on the web,

00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:40.260
during this week we streamed
more than 100 years of video

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.628
to 148 nations,

00:11:43.628 --> 00:11:47.829
and the websites are still there
and they will be forever, actually,

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:49.735
because Hurtigruten was selected

00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:54.267
to be part of the Norwegian
UNESCO list of documents,

00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:57.258
and it's also in
the Guinness Book of Records

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.764
as the longest documentary ever.

00:12:00.764 --> 00:12:04.247
(Applause)

00:12:04.247 --> 00:12:07.985
Thank you.

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:11.375
But it's a long program,

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:14.463
so some watched part of it,
like the Prime Minister.

00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:16.205
Some watched a little bit more.

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:20.614
It says, "I haven't used
my bed for five days."

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:25.085
And he's 82 years old,
and he hardly slept.

00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:28.441
He kept watching because
something might happen,

00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.854
though it probably won't. (Laughter)

00:12:30.854 --> 00:12:33.503
This is the number
of viewers along the route.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.105
You can see the famous Trollfjord

00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:39.849
and a day after, all-time high for NRK2.

00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:45.671
If you see the four biggest
channels in Norway during June 2011,

00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:47.968
they will look like this,

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:51.818
and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure
to put Hurtigruten on top of it.

00:12:51.818 --> 00:12:53.541
It looks like this:

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:56.908
3.2 million Norwegians
watched part of this program,

00:12:56.908 --> 00:12:58.788
and we are only five million here.

00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:01.822
Even the passengers on board
the Hurtigruten coastal ship --

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:03.436
(Laughter) --

00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:07.561
they chose to watched the telly
instead of turning 90 degrees

00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:09.675
and watching out the window.

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:13.416
So we were allowed to be 
part of people's living room

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:16.173
with this strange TV program,

00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:19.546
with music, nature, people.

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:22.239
And Slow TV was now a buzzword,

00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:26.073
and we started looking for other things
we could make Slow TV about.

00:13:26.073 --> 00:13:29.515
So we could either take something long
and make it a topic,

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:31.736
like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:34.267
or we could take a topic and make it long.

00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:36.775
This is the last project.
It's the peep show.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.561
It's 14 hours of birdwatching
on a TV screen,

00:13:39.561 --> 00:13:42.742
actually 87 days on the web.

00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:46.364
We have made 18 hours
of live salmon fishing.

00:13:46.364 --> 00:13:49.429
It actually took three hours
before we got the first fish,

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.240
and that's quite slow.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.276
We have made 12 hours of boat ride
into the beautiful Telemark Canal,

00:13:56.276 --> 00:13:59.821
and we have made another train ride
with the northern railway,

00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:03.823
and because this we couldn't do live,
we did it in four seasons

00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:07.898
just to give the viewer
another experience on the way.

00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:13.598
So our next project got us
some attention outside Norway.

00:14:13.598 --> 00:14:16.484
This is from the Colbert Report
on Comedy Central.

00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:20.280
(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye
on a wildly popular program from Norway

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.213
called "National Firewood Night,"

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:27.485
which consisted of mostly people in parkas
chatting and chopping in the woods,

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:31.130
and then eight hours of a fire 
burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.731
It destroyed the other 
top Norwegian shows,

00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:36.146
like "So You Think
You Can Watch Paint Dry"

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:39.977
and "The Amazing Glacier Race."

00:14:39.977 --> 00:14:45.182
And get this, almost 20 percent
of the Norwegian population tuned in,

00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:46.850
20 percent.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.727
TH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping
can be that interesting,

00:14:50.727 --> 00:14:52.260
why not knitting?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.978
So on our next project,

00:14:53.978 --> 00:14:58.995
we used more than eight hours
to go live from a sheep to a sweater,

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:01.302
and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:03.451
he liked that.

00:15:03.451 --> 00:15:10.324
(Music)

00:15:10.324 --> 00:15:14.044
(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people
on the show are falling asleep,

00:15:14.044 --> 00:15:16.320
and after all that,
the knitters actually failed

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.996
to break the world record.

00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:19.342
They did not succeed,

00:15:19.342 --> 00:15:21.585
but remember the old Norwegian saying,

00:15:21.585 --> 00:15:23.763
it's not whether you win
or lose that counts.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:26.487
In fact, nothing counts, 
and death is coming for us all.

00:15:26.487 --> 00:15:27.931
(Laughter)

00:15:27.931 --> 00:15:30.825
TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:34.105
This is so completely different
to other TV programming.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:38.847
We take the viewer on a journey
that happens right now in real time,

00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:42.424
and the viewer gets the feeling
of actually being there,

00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:44.588
actually being on the train, on the boat,

00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:46.415
and knitting together with others,

00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:48.872
and the reason I think
why they're doing that

00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:51.352
is because we don't edit the timeline.

00:15:51.352 --> 00:15:53.720
It's important that
we don't edit the timeline,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.919
and it's also important
that what we make Slow TV about

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:01.648
is something that we all can relate to,
that the viewer can relate to,

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:04.765
and that somehow has 
a root in our culture.

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:06.491
This is a picture from last summer

00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:09.068
when we traveled the coast
again for seven weeks.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:13.431
And of course this is a lot of planning,
this is a lot of logistics.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:17.543
So this is the working plan
for 150 people last summer,

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.388
but more important is what you don't plan.

00:16:20.388 --> 00:16:22.905
You don't plan what's going to happen.

00:16:22.905 --> 00:16:25.891
You have to just
take your cameras with you.

00:16:25.891 --> 00:16:27.411
It's like a sports event.

00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.570
You rig them and you see what's happening.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.054
So this is actually
the whole running order

00:16:32.054 --> 00:16:36.501
for Hurtigruten, 134 hours,
just written on one page.

00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:40.553
We didn't know anything more
when we left Bergen.

00:16:40.553 --> 00:16:43.897
So you have to let the viewers
make the stories themselves,

00:16:43.897 --> 00:16:46.126
and I'll give you an example of that.

00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:47.890
This is from last summer,

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.748
and as a TV producer,

00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:53.395
it's a nice picture, but now
you can cut to the next one.

00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:55.135
But this is Slow TV,

00:16:55.135 --> 00:16:58.809
so you have to keep this picture until 
it really starts hurting your stomach,

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.169
and then you keep it a little bit longer,

00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:02.689
and when you keep it that long,

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.453
I'm sure some of you now
have noticed the cow.

00:17:05.453 --> 00:17:07.487
Some of you have seen the flag.

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:09.893
Some of you start wondering,
is the farmer at home?

00:17:09.893 --> 00:17:12.340
Has he left? Is he watching the cow?

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.567
And where is that cow going?

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.801
So my point is, the longer
you keep a picture like this,

00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:21.093
and we kept it for 10 minutes,

00:17:21.093 --> 00:17:25.064
you start making
the stories in your own head.

00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:29.267
That's Slow TV.

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:34.677
So we think that Slow TV is
one nice way of telling a TV story,

00:17:34.677 --> 00:17:37.161
and we think that we
can continue doing it,

00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:41.665
not too often, once or twice a year,
so we keep the feeling of an event,

00:17:41.665 --> 00:17:44.568
and we also think that
the good Slow TV idea,

00:17:44.568 --> 00:17:46.240
that's the idea when people say,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.676
"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:52.718
When people smile, it might be
a very good slow idea,

00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:56.970
so after all, life is best
when it's a bit strange.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.463
Thank you.

00:17:58.463 --> 00:18:05.047
(Applause)
