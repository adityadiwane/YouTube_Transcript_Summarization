00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is something in the way of an experiment.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Today's its debut.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
They are live

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and reacting to me in real time.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
So fingers crossed.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And keep your eyes on the big screen.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Augmented reality

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
is the melding of the real world

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
with computer-generated imagery.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It seems the perfect medium

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to investigate magic

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and ask, why, in a technological age,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
we continue to have

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
this magical sense of wonder.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Magic is deception,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
but it is a deception we enjoy.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
To enjoy being deceived,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
an audience must first

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
suspend its disbelief.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
who first suggested this receptive state of mind.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
to produce for these shadows of the imagination

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
a willing suspension of disbelief

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that, for a moment,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
constitutes poetic faith.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
for any kind of theatrical experience.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Without it,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
a script is just words.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Augmented reality

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is just the latest technology.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And sleight of hand

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
is just an artful demonstration

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
of dexterity.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
We do it every day,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
while reading novels,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
watching television

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
or going to the movies.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We willingly enter fictional worlds

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
where we cheer our heroes

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and cry for friends we never had.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Without this ability

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
there is no magic.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It was Jean Robert-Houdin,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
France's greatest illusionist,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
who first recognized the role of the magician

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
as a storyteller.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
MT: Which means magic is theater

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and every trick

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
is a story.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
The tricks of magic

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
There are tales of creation and loss,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
death and resurrection,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and obstacles that must be overcome.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Magicians play with fire and steel,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
defy the fury of the buzzsaw,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
dare to catch a bullet

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
or attempt a deadly escape.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But audiences don't come to see the magician die,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
they come to see him live.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Because the best stories

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
always have a happy ending.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
The tricks of magic have one special element.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
They are stories with a twist.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Now Edward de Bono argued

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
that our brains are pattern matching machines.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
He said that magicians deliberately exploit

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
the way their audiences think.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
on the momentum error.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
that are perfectly reasonable,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but do not, in fact, match

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
what is being done in front of them.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
MT: In that respect,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
magic tricks are like jokes.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Jokes lead us down a path

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to an expected destination.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
into something entirely unexpected,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
we laugh.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
The same thing happens

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
when people watch magic tricks.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
The finale

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
defies logic,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
gives new insight into the problem,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and audiences express their amazement

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
with laughter.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It's fun to be fooled.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
One of the key qualities of all stories

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
is that they're made to be shared.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
We feel compelled to tell them.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
When I do a trick at a party --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
(Laughter)

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that person will immediately pull their friend over

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and ask me to do it again.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
They want to share the experience.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
That makes my job more difficult,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
because, if I want to surprise them,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
I need to tell a story that starts the same,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
but ends differently --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
a trick with a twist

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
on a twist.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
It keeps me busy.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Now experts believe

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
We think in narrative structures.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
We connect events and emotions

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and instinctively transform them

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
into a sequence that can be easily understood.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It's a uniquely human achievement.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
We all want to share our stories,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
whether it is the trick we saw at the party,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the bad day at the office

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Today, thanks to technology,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
we can share those stories as never before,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
by email, Facebook,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
blogs, tweets,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
on TED.com.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
The tools of social networking,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
these are the digital campfires

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
around which the audience gathers

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to hear our story.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We turn facts into similes and metaphors,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and even fantasies.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
We polish the rough edges of our lives

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
so that they feel whole.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Our stories make us the people we are

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and, sometimes, the people we want to be.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
They give us our identity

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and a sense of community.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And if the story is a good one,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.260
it might even make us smile.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Thank you.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
(Applause)

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Thank you.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
(Applause)
