Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.116
This is me building a prototype

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.036
for six hours straight.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.957
This is slave labor to my own project.

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:26.947
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:31.713
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world

00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:34.501
with brute-force assembly techniques.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.335
And this is exactly why I started studying

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.604
how to program physical materials to build themselves.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:43.364
But there is another world.

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:45.359
Today at the micro- and nanoscales,

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.110
there's an unprecedented revolution happening.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.242
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:54.966
to change shape, change properties

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.952
and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:00.459
There's even a software called cadnano

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.242
that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:06.326
like nano robots or drug delivery systems

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:10.629
and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:12.702
But if we look at the human scale,

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:15.758
there's massive problems that aren't being addressed

00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:18.126
by those nanoscale technologies.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.225
If we look at construction and manufacturing,

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:24.418
there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.745
and excessive labor techniques.

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:29.250
In infrastructure, let's just take one example.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.733
Take piping.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.458
In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:38.917
that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.208
We bury them in the ground.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:42.829
If anything changes -- if the environment changes,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.466
the ground moves, or demand changes --

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:49.716
we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:53.084
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,

00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:58.255
that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials

00:01:58.255 --> 00:01:59.932
and the built environment.

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.118
And I don't mean automated machines.

00:02:02.118 --> 00:02:04.577
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.

00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:08.461
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.517
And that's called self-assembly,

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:15.034
which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.527
through only local interaction.

00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:20.702
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:22.677
We need a few simple ingredients.

00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:25.516
The first ingredient is materials and geometry,

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:28.985
and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:30.643
And you can use passive energy --

00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:35.327
so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.

00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:38.402
And then you need smartly designed interactions.

00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:40.535
And those interactions allow for error correction,

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.535
and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.767
So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.051
from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional

00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.118
and even four-dimensional systems.

00:02:54.118 --> 00:02:56.004
So in one-dimensional systems --

00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.911
this is a project called the self-folding proteins.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:03.618
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:06.299
in this case it's the crambin protein --

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.945
you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:13.096
and you break that down into a series of components.

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:15.370
And then we embed elastic.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.711
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.562
it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:24.662
And this gives us a tangible model

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:28.396
of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:30.680
and all of the intricacies of the geometry.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.128
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:36.930
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.229
so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.682
In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal

00:03:45.682 --> 00:03:47.646
with Autodesk and Arthur Olson

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:49.344
where we looked at autonomous parts --

00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:53.663
so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.

00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:56.429
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:58.896
They had different molecular structures inside

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:01.120
and different colors that could be mixed and matched.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.369
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.870
And so these became intuitive models

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.362
to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.

00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:11.179
This is the polio virus.

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.111
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.

00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:14.557
And then you shake it randomly

00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:18.061
and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.

00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.028
And this is demonstrating that through random energy,

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:25.656
we can build non-random shapes.

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:29.180
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.334
Last year at TED Long Beach,

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:34.545
we built an installation that builds installations.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.082
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:40.583
So we built a large rotating chamber,

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:43.796
and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:45.381
adding energy to the system

00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:48.827
and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:50.206
and how we could use this

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:54.952
as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.

00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:56.619
So remember, I said 4D.

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:00.314
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,

00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.200
which is a collaboration with Stratasys,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.035
and it's called 4D printing.

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:05.995
The idea behind 4D printing

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:08.995
is that you take multi-material 3D printing --

00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:11.184
so you can deposit multiple materials --

00:05:11.184 --> 00:05:13.068
and you add a new capability,

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:14.934
which is transformation,

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.251
that right off the bed,

00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:20.578
the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.

00:05:20.578 --> 00:05:24.078
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.

00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:25.729
So you completely print this part,

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.533
and it can transform into something else.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:33.494
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.

00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:36.617
And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:39.819
and try to optimize which parts are folding when.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.549
But most importantly, we can use this same software

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:45.457
for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems

00:05:45.457 --> 00:05:48.300
and human scale self-assembly systems.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.813
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.

00:05:51.813 --> 00:05:53.530
Here's the first demonstration.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.434
A single strand dipped in water

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:57.783
that completely self-folds on its own

00:05:57.783 --> 00:06:01.701
into the letters M I T.

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.523
I'm biased.

00:06:03.523 --> 00:06:06.972
This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:11.595
that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.446
So no human interaction.

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.335
And we think this is the first time

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:17.582
that a program and transformation

00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:20.832
has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.

00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:23.562
And it also might just be the manufacturing technique

00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:27.696
that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.

00:06:27.696 --> 00:06:28.882
So I know you're probably thinking,

00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:33.114
okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?

00:06:33.114 --> 00:06:35.369
So I've started a lab at MIT,

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.251
and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:40.395
And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials

00:06:40.395 --> 00:06:41.586
for the built environment.

00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:43.549
And we think there's a few key sectors

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.863
that have fairly near-term applications.

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:47.918
One of those is in extreme environments.

00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:50.464
These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,

00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:52.952
our current construction techniques don't work,

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:56.512
it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.

00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:58.879
And space is a great example of that.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.245
We're trying to design new scenarios for space

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.545
that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:08.235
that can go from highly functional systems from one to another.

00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:10.346
Let's go back to infrastructure.

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:14.245
In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.

00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:17.045
And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:20.668
Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract

00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:23.418
to change capacity or change flow rate,

00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:27.952
or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.

00:07:27.952 --> 00:07:30.562
So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.

00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:34.845
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:36.660
So I want to remind you today

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.044
of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.

00:07:40.044 --> 00:07:43.509
These are complex things built with complex parts

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:46.294
that come together in complex ways.

00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:49.493
So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from

00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:53.546
to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:57.245
how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,

00:07:57.245 --> 00:08:00.320
so that we can go from a world like this

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.270
to a world that's more like this.

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:14.542
Thank you.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:16.843
(Applause)
