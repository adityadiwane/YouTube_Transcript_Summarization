00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
If you think about the phone --

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and Intel has tested

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a lot of the things I'm going to show you,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
over the last 10 years,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
in about 600 elderly households --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
trying to understand: How do we measure

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and monitor behavior

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
in a medically meaningful way?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And if you think about the phone, right,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
it's something that we can use for some incredible ways

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
We're testing these kinds of simple

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
sensor-network technologies in the home

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
can help them deal with their medications.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that sits on their kitchen table and says,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
"I'm old. I'm frail."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It's surreptitious technology

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
that's helping them do a simple task

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of taking the right pill at the right time.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Because that moment when you answer the phone

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
is a cognitive test every time that you do it.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
"Hello? Hey."

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
All right? That's the first time.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
"Hello? Uh, hey."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.260
"Hello? Uh, who?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Oh, hey."

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
All right? Very big differences

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
between the way I answered the phone the three times.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And as we monitor phone usage

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
by seniors over a long period of time,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
down to the tenths of a microsecond,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that recognition moment

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
of whether they can figure out that person on the other end

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
is a friend and we start talking to them immediately,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Waiting for that recognition moment

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
than anything that shows up clinically today.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
We call these behavioral markers.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
may be the best early indicator

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and your voice has become so quiet.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
When you pick up the phone,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
how much tremor are you having,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And then wow, what a radical idea,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
we -- except in the United States --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
might be able to use this newfangled technology

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Wow, what a great day that will be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
for the last 10 years at Intel.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
How do you put simple disruptive technologies,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Behavioral markers matter.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
How do we change behavior?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
How do we measure changes in behavior

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
in a meaningful way that's going to help us with

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
prevention of disease, early onset of disease,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Now, why would Intel let me

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
trying to understand the needs of seniors

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
This is some of the field work that we've done.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
in 20 countries over the last 10 years.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
We study people in Rochester, New York.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We go live with them in the winter

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
because what they do in the winter,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
is very different than in the summer.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
If they have a hip fracture we go with them

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and we study their entire discharge experience.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
we fly and study them as well.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So, we study the holistic health experience

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in 20 different countries.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Why is Intel willing to fund that?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that could help with independent living,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
You know, back in 2000,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
we were all so obsessed with paying attention

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
to the aging of our computers,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and whether or not they were going to survive

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It was right around New Years.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And that switchover,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
when we had the larger number of older people on the planet,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
for the first time than younger people.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
or some major other pandemic,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that's the expectation from demographers, going forward.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to convince Intel to work on this. Right?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Y2K + 10 was coming,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
the baby boomers starting to retire.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
This is a map of the entire world.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It's like the lights are on,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
but nobody's home on this demographic

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Y2K + 10 problem. Right?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.260
I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and we're not doing anything about it.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
The health reform bill is largely ignoring

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
the realities of the age wave that's coming,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and the implications for what we need to do to change

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
not only how we pay for care,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
but deliver care in some radically different ways.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And in fact, it's upon us.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
She was born one second after midnight in 1946.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
A retired school teacher,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
there she is with a Social Security administrator.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.260
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and do something about it. We'll wait until

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
it's more of a catastrophe, and react,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
as opposed to prepare for it.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So, one of the reasons it's so

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
is, I want to argue, we have what I would call

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
mainframe poisoning.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and I've been extending and expanding this.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
I was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I just extended it."

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
You know, this is the mainframe.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
This mentality of traveling to

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
actually began in 1787.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This is the first general hospital in Vienna.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And actually the second general hospital in Vienna,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
in about 1850, was where we started to build out

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And it's a place in which we started developing

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
architecture that literally divided the body,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and divided care into departments and compartments.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And it was reflected in our architecture,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
it was reflected in the way that we taught students,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and this mainframe mentality persists today.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Now, I'm not anti-hospital.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And this is mainframe healthcare.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And just as 30 years ago

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
we couldn't conceive that we would have the power

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
in our purses and on our belts,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that we're carrying around in our cell phone today,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and suddenly, computing,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that used to be an expert driven system,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
that shift from mainframe to personal computing

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
is what we have to do for healthcare.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
to a personal model of healthcare.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
We are obsessed with this way of thinking.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
"Quick response: healthcare."

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
The first word that comes up is "doctor."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and healthcare innovation as something

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that goes into that place.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Our entire health reform discussion right now,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
health I.T., when we talk with policy makers,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
equals "How are we going to get doctors using

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
electronic medical records in the mainframe?"

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We're not thinking about

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
how do we shift from the mainframe to the home.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And the problem with this is

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
the way we conceive healthcare. Right?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It's population-based.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and send them home,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website --

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And now we want to do a double-double

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
of the age wave coming through?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
We've got to focus on the home.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
prevention-driven?

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.260
How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
How do we collect not just biological data

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
but behavioral data, psychological data,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
relational data, in and on and around the home?

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
that uses all this great technology that's around us

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
to change our behavior?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
That's what we need to do for our personal health model.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
from one of our studies --

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
in her 90s, had to move out of her home

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
because her family was worried about falls.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Raise your hand if you had a serious fall

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
in your household, or any of your loved ones,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
your parents or so forth. Right?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
She tripped over her oxygen tank.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Many people in this generation won't press the button,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Boomers will press the button. Trust me.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
finally somebody came in and found her,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
sent her to the hospital.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
basically, had heart problems, and died

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Now, the most frightening thing about this is

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
this is my wife's grandmother.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
I work for Intel, I make a good salary,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
it's an area of research that I work on.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
I have access to senators and CEOs.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I can't stop this from happening.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
or don't have the kind of access

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
from ever occurring in the first place?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
to try to do exactly that.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It's a research platform.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
kind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
in the real world,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
things like tremor, gait,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
stride length and those kinds of things.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
The problem is, our understanding of falls today,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
That's sort of the state of the art.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that we borrowed from sports medicine,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
to collect actual kinematic motion data

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
that can show us that mom has become risk at falls?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And most often we can do two interventions,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
fix the meds mix.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
knew that they were on, because we see the changes

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
in their patterns in the household. Right?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
These discoveries of behavioral markers,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and behavioral changes

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
of -- actually what you're seeing is

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
she's looking at data,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Here's what some of this data might look like.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
This is actually sensor firings.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
These are two different subjects in our study.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
It's about a year's worth of data.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
The color represents different rooms they are in the house.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
This person on the left is living in their own home.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
But when we look at these cycles of data

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
over a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything from

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
motion around different rooms in the house,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
about gait and stride length -- these streams of data

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
that we've never understood before.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
You can go to ORCATech.org --

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
to see more about that.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
funders in the world

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
of independent living technology research.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
I'm not bragging about how much we fund;

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
it's how little anyone else actually pays attention

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
to aging and funds innovation on aging,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
chronic disease management and independent living in the home.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
10,000 households or bust.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
We need to drive

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.260
a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
of independent living technologies,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
where we have 10,000 elderly connected households

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
with broadband, full medical characterization,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and a platform by which we can start to experiment

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
that the universities fund,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
So, 10,000 households or bust.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.260
These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
My fifth and final phrase:

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
I have tried for two years,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and there were moments when we were quite close,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
from something and to something,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
from a mainframe model

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
to a personal health model,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
or to mean something more than just a debate

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
about the public option and how we're going to finance.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
We're going to figure something out

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
for the next 10 years, and try it.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
No matter who pays for it,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
and treating the home and the patient

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
and the family member and the caregivers

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
as part of these coordinated care teams

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and using disruptive technologies that are already here

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
The president needs to stand up and say,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
at the end of a healthcare reform debate,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
to the home, in 10 years."

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
It's achievable. We should do it economically,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
we should do it morally,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and we should do it for quality of life.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
But there is no goal within this health reform.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
It's just a mess today.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
So, you know, that's my last message to you.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And if we don't create a personal health movement,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
something that we're all aiming towards in reform,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
then we're going to move nowhere.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
Thanks very much.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
