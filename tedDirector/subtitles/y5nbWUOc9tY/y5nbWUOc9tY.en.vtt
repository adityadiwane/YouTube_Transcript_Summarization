00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.101
It's time to start designing for our ears.

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.181
Architects and designers tend to focus

00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.707
exclusively on these.

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:26.821
They use these to design with and they design for them,

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.149
which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.946
like this — (loud crowd noise) — and sound like this,

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.493
shouting from a foot away to try and be heard

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:34.795
by our dinner companion,

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:38.018
or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds,

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:41.861
with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:43.397
on a cheap stereo system,

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.050
making us jump out of our skins.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.434
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:52.146
And it's not just our quality of life which suffers.

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.921
It's our health,

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.932
our social behavior, and our productivity as well.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.574
How does this work? Well, two ways.

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:03.013
First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:06.444
Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically,

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:08.644
cognitively and behaviorally all the time.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.381
The sound around us is affecting us

00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:12.703
even though we're not conscious of it.

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:14.459
There's a second way though, as well.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.836
That's interference. Communication requires sending

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:21.736
and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:24.200
about the importance of conscious listening,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.234
but I can send as well as I like,

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:28.648
and you can be brilliant conscious listeners.

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:32.148
If the space I'm sending it in is not effective,

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.642
that communication can't happen.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:37.172
Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics.

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:40.872
A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.040
Many rooms are not so good.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.071
Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.544
which I think we all care about: health and education.

00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:50.776
(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.808
in a hospital, I was asking myself,

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:56.945
how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.253
Hospital sound is getting worse all the time.

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:01.259
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.863
in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients

00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:06.679
but also the people working there.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.556
I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:14.021
wouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.575
the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.630
Most of all, though, it affects the patients,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.838
and that could be you, it could be me.

00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.177
Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.217
It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:30.601
and with threatening noise like this going on,

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.753
your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.796
is telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous."

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:40.025
And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.177
There are just huge benefits to come

00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:45.214
from designing for the ears in our health care.

00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:48.121
This is an area I intend to take on this year.

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.086
Education.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.682
When I see a classroom that looks like this,

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:53.559
can you imagine how this sounds?

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.890
I am forced to ask myself a question.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.467
("Do architects have ears?") (Laughter)

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:01.134
Now, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:04.023
are architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:06.088
But I think sometimes they don't use them

00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:08.751
when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:12.442
This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.447
which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed

00:03:14.447 --> 00:03:17.594
by one of Britain's top architects.

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:19.419
Unfortunately, it was designed like a corporate

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.818
headquarters, with a vast central atrium

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:26.092
and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:28.018
The children couldn't hear their teachers.

00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:30.739
They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.819
putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.881
of open plan classrooms right now, please.

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:41.409
It's not just these modern buildings which suffer.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.746
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:45.940
A study in Florida just a few years ago found

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.617
that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:50.817
in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility

00:03:50.817 --> 00:03:53.268
is just 50 percent.

00:03:53.268 --> 00:03:55.468
Children are losing one word in two.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:58.113
Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education,

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.825
but it does mean they have to work very hard

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:02.801
to join the dots and understand what's going on.

00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.574
This is affected massively by reverberation time,

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:07.474
how reverberant a room is.

00:04:07.474 --> 00:04:11.032
In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:14.728
which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:27.032
(Inaudible echoing voice)

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:28.849
Not so good, is it?

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.308
If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds

00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:36.256
by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:38.964
and so forth, this is what you get.

00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:42.825
Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:45.697
with a small set of letters. In arithmetic,

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:48.051
infinitely many numbers can be composed

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:51.653
from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.217
Julian Treasure: What a difference.

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:55.057
Now that education you would receive,

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:57.987
and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:00.676
for those simulations. The signal was the same,

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.075
the background noise was the same.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:04.518
All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom

00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:06.192
in those two examples.

00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:08.612
If education can be likened to watering a garden,

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:12.779
which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.835
is evaporating before it reaches the flowers,

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:17.867
especially for some groups,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:21.243
for example, those with hearing impairment.

00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:23.995
Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:26.430
who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.806
even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:31.622
fall into that group, on any given day.

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.798
Then you have children for whom English is a second language,

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:37.734
or whatever they're being taught in is a second language.

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:41.318
In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.

00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:44.978
And finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.194
we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate

00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:50.891
when they're in a noisy environment doing group work.

00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.552
Add those up. That is a lot of children

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.964
who are not receiving their education properly.

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:58.200
It's not just the children who are affected, though.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.783
(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found

00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:03.338
the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.

00:06:03.338 --> 00:06:07.564
I have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels

00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:11.348
of sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.

00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:14.156
This chart maps the teacher's heart rate

00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:16.580
against the noise level.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.287
Noise goes up, heart rate goes up.

00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:21.436
That is not good for you.

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:25.516
In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:29.044
of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:33.751
the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.

00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:36.600
To you and me, that's a heart attack.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.319
It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.619
that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:47.891
by teaching in environments like that day after day.

00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:49.947
What does it cost to treat a classroom

00:06:49.947 --> 00:06:52.717
down to that 0.4-second reverberation time?

00:06:52.717 --> 00:06:55.451
Two and a half thousand pounds.

00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:58.627
And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.968
which incidentally showed that when you do this,

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:03.331
you do not just make a room that's suitable

00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:04.928
for hearing-impaired children, you make a room

00:07:04.928 --> 00:07:10.212
where behavior improves, and results improve significantly,

00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:14.204
this found that sending a child out of area to a school

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:16.835
that does have such a room, if you don't have one,

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.297
costs 90,000 pounds a year.

00:07:20.297 --> 00:07:22.684
I think the economics are pretty clear on this.

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:24.703
I'm glad that debate is happening on this.

00:07:24.703 --> 00:07:27.269
I just moderated a major conference in London

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.318
a few weeks ago called Sound Education,

00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:31.115
which brought together top acousticians,

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:33.136
government people, teachers, and so forth.

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:37.335
We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits

00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:40.035
that are available for designing for the ears in education,

00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:41.846
unbelievable.

00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:44.915
Out of that conference, incidentally, also came

00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.917
a free app which is designed to help children study

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.288
if they're having to work at home, for example,

00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:51.880
in a noisy kitchen.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.118
And that's free out of that conference.

00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:58.069
Let's broaden the perspective a little bit

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:59.480
and look at cities.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.972
We have urban planners.

00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:05.117
Where are the urban sound planners?

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:08.324
I don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there

00:08:08.324 --> 00:08:10.860
to transform our experience in our cities.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.967
The World Health Organization estimates

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:15.551
that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep

00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:19.484
degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:22.313
And in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.

00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:24.972
Where are the office sound planners?

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.859
People who say, don't sit that team next to this team,

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.192
because they like noise and they need quiet.

00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:31.931
Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen

00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:32.874
in the conference room,

00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:34.883
and then place one tiny microphone

00:08:34.883 --> 00:08:38.120
in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.239
If you can hear me, you can understand me

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:43.364
without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,

00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:45.468
that does not work.

00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:48.684
So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,

00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:50.820
noise in offices has been shown to make people

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.443
less helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,

00:08:53.443 --> 00:08:55.964
and less productive at work.

00:08:55.964 --> 00:08:59.017
Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers.

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:01.252
Where are the interior sound designers?

00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:04.592
Hey, let's all be interior sound designers,

00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:07.409
take on listening to our rooms and designing sound

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:08.927
that's effective and appropriate.

00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:11.468
My friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.354
coined the phrase "invisible architecture."

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.904
I love that phrase.

00:09:15.904 --> 00:09:20.984
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience,

00:09:20.984 --> 00:09:24.592
so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:28.102
that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:31.343
our health and well being, our social behavior

00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:33.219
and our productivity.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:36.725
It's time to start designing for the ears.

00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:39.555
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:41.087
(Applause)

00:09:41.087 --> 00:09:45.843
Thank you. (Applause)
