00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
What I want to talk about today is one idea.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
It's an idea for a new kind of school,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
about what schools are for and how they work.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Where it comes from

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is an organization called the Young Foundation,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
which, over many decades,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and things like Extended Schools,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and the School of Everything.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And about five years ago, we asked

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
what was the most important need for innovation

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
in schooling here in the U.K.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And we felt the most important priority

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
was to bring together two sets of problems.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
One was large numbers of bored teenagers

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
who just didn't like school,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and future jobs.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And employers who kept complaining

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
didn't have the right attitudes and experience.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And so we try to ask:

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
not fighting to stay out?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And after hundreds of conversations

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
with teenagers and teachers and parents

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and employers and schools

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
from Paraguay to Australia,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and looking at some of the academic research,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
which showed the importance

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
of what's now called non-cognitive skills --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
the skills of motivation, resilience --

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and that these are as important

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
which we called the Studio School.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And we called it a studio school

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
where work and learning are integrated.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
You work by learning,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and you learn by working.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
First of all, we wanted small schools --

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
about 300, 400 pupils --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
14 to 19 year-olds,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
not through sitting in classrooms,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
but through real-life, practical projects,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
working on commission

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to businesses, NGO's and others.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
who would have timetables

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
much more like a work environment in a business.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And all of this will be done within the public system,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
funded by public money,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
but independently run.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And all at no extra cost, no selection,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and allowing the pupils the route into university,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and have manual jobs as well.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Underlying it was some very simple ideas

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
they learn best in teams

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and they learn best by doing things for real --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
all the opposite of what mainstream schooling

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
actually does.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Now that was a nice idea,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
We tried it out,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
first in Luton --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
famous for its airport and not much else, I fear --

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and then improved them --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
but we found that the young people loved it.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They found it much more motivational, much more exciting

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
than traditional education.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And perhaps most important of all,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
two years later when the exam results came through,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the pupils who had been put on these field trials

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
who were in the lowest performing groups

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
had jumped right to the top --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in terms of GCSE's,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
which is the British marking system.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Now not surprisingly,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
that influenced some people to think we were onto something.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
The minister of education

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
down south in London

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
described himself as a "big fan."

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And the business organizations thought we were onto something

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
in terms of a way of preparing children much better

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
for real-life work today.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and helping it, not just with big businesses,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
but small businesses all over the country.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
We started with two schools.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
That's grown this year to about 10.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
open across England,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and another 40 areas

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
want to have their own schools opening --

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
a pretty rapid spread

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of this idea.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Interestingly,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
it's happened almost entirely without media coverage.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
across teachers, parents,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
people involved in education.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And it spread because of the power of an idea --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
so the very, very simple idea

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
about turning education on its head

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and putting the things which were marginal,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
things like working in teams, doing practical projects,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and putting them right at the heart of learning,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
rather than on the edges.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Now there's a whole set of new schools

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
opening up this autumn.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
This is one from Yorkshire

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And this one is focused

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
on creative and media industries.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Other ones have a focus on health care,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
tourism, engineering

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and other fields.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
We think we're onto something.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
It's not perfect yet,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but we think this is one idea

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
which can transform the lives

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
who are really bored by schooling.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
It doesn't animate them.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and hear things said to you for hour after hour.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
they want education to be for real.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And my hope is that some of you out there

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
may be able to help us.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
We feel we're on the beginning of a journey

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
of experiment and improvement

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
to turn the Studio School idea

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
into something which is present,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
not as a universal answer for every child,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Thank you very much.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
(Applause)
