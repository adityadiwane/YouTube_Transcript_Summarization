00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:19.133
Living with a physical
disability isn't easy

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:21.356
anywhere in the world,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.185
but if you live in a country
like the United States,

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:27.278
there's certain appurtenances available
to you that do make life easier.

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.951
So if you're in a building,
you can take an elevator.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:32.231
If you're crossing the street,
you have sidewalk cutouts.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.494
And if you have to travel
some distance farther

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:37.661
than you can do under your own power,
there's accessible vehicles,

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.522
and if you can't afford one of those,

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:41.895
there's accessible public transportation.

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.586
But in the developing world,
things are quite different.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.805
There's 40 million people who need
a wheelchair but don't have one,

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.160
and the majority of these
people live in rural areas,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.045
where the only connections to community,
to employment, to education,

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.528
are by traveling long
distances on rough terrain

00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:00.265
often under their own power.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.623
And the devices usually
available to these people

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:05.081
are not made for that context,
break down quickly,

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.391
and are hard to repair.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:12.111
I started looking at wheelchairs
in developing countries in 2005,

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.927
when I spent the summer assessing
the state of technology in Tanzania,

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.740
and I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair
manufacturers, disability groups,

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:21.597
and what stood out to me

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.049
is that there wasn't a device available

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:26.597
that was designed for rural
areas, that could go fast

00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.213
and efficiently on many types of terrain.

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:30.996
So being a mechanical engineer,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.782
being at MIT and having lots
of resources available to me,

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:36.096
I thought I'd try to do
something about it.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.049
Now when you're talking
about trying to travel

00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:41.255
long distances on rough terrain,

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.988
I immediately thought of a mountain bike,

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:44.401
and a mountain bike's good at doing this

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:46.240
because it has a gear train,

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:49.074
and you can shift to a low gear
if you have to climb a hill

00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:50.700
or go through mud or sand

00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:52.814
and you get a lot of torque
but a low speed.

00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:54.929
And if you want to go
faster, say on pavement,

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:56.334
you can shift to a high gear,

00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:58.406
and you get less torque,
but higher speeds.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.987
So the logical evolution here

00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:02.821
is to just make a wheelchair
with mountain bike components,

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:04.179
which many people have done.

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:07.361
But these are two products
available in the U.S. that

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:10.052
would be difficult to transfer
into developing countries

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:12.602
because they're much, much too expensive.

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:14.878
And the context I'm talking about is where

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:18.874
you need to have a product
that is less than 200 dollars.

00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:21.305
And this ideal product
would also be able to go

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.309
about five kilometers a day so you
could get to your job, get to school,

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.161
and do it on many,
many different types of terrain.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.053
But when you get home or want
to go indoors at your work,

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:34.474
it's got to be small enough and maneuverable
enough to use inside.

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:37.879
And furthermore, if you want it to last
a long time out in rural areas,

00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:41.941
it has to be repairable using the local
tools, materials and knowledge

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.757
in those contexts.

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.697
So the real crux of the problem here is,

00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:50.845
how do you make a system
that's a simple device

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.976
but gives you a large
mechanical advantage?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.163
How do you make a mountain
bike for your arms

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:57.854
that doesn't have the mountain
bike cost and complexity?

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.255
So as is the case with simple solutions,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.041
oftentimes the answer is right in front
of your face, and for us it was levers.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:08.675
We use levers all the time,
in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.461
And that moment of inspiration,
that key invention moment,

00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:14.009
was when I was sitting
in front of my design notebook

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.781
and I started thinking
about somebody grabbing a lever,

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:18.894
and if they grab
near the end of the lever,

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:20.728
they can get an effectively long lever

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:23.553
and produce a lot of torque
as they push back and forth,

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:25.773
and effectively get a low gear.

00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:28.180
And as they slide
their hand down the lever,

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:31.016
they can push with a smaller
effective lever length,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.136
but push through a bigger
angle every stroke,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.795
which makes a faster rotational speed,
and gives you an effective high gear.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.547
So what's exciting about this system

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:41.150
is that it's really, really
mechanically simple,

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:42.984
and you could make it using technology

00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:44.966
that's been around for hundreds of years.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.151
So seeing this in practice,

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:49.128
this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,

00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:50.868
after a few years of development,

00:03:50.892 --> 00:03:52.805
we're now going into production with,

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.829
and this is a full-time wheelchair user --

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:56.370
he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,

00:03:56.394 --> 00:04:00.369
and you see he's able to traverse
pretty rough terrain.

00:04:00.393 --> 00:04:04.900
Again, the key innovation of this technology
is that when he wants to go fast,

00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:08.955
he just grabs the levers near the pivots
and goes through a big angle every stroke,

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.880
and as the going gets tougher, he just
slides his hands up the levers,

00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:14.476
creates more torque, and kind
of bench-presses his way

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.662
out of trouble through the rough terrain.

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:19.674
Now the big, important point here is that

00:04:19.698 --> 00:04:22.387
the person is the complex
machine in this system.

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:25.733
It's the person that's sliding
his hands up and down the levers,

00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:28.455
so the mechanism itself can be very simple

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.527
and composed of bicycle parts you
can get anywhere in the world.

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:33.118
Because those bicycle parts

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:35.623
are so ubiquitously available,
they're super-cheap.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.803
They're made by the gazillions
in China and India,

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:39.659
and we can source them
anywhere in the world,

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:42.398
build the chair anywhere,
and most importantly repair it,

00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:44.851
even out in a village
with a local bicycle mechanic

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:49.206
who has local tools, knowledge
and parts available.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.883
Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,

00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:55.403
all you have to do is pull
the levers out of the drivetrain,

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:58.680
stow them in the frame, and it
converts into a normal wheelchair

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:01.324
that you can use just
like any other normal wheelchair,

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:03.341
and we sized it like a normal wheelchair,

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:07.476
so it's narrow enough to fit
through a standard doorway,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.995
it's low enough to fit under a table,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.988
and it's small and maneuverable
enough to fit in a bathroom

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:18.012
and this is important so the user
can get up close to a toilet,

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:19.716
and be able to transfer off

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.307
just like he could in a normal wheelchair.

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.399
Now, there's three important
points that I want to stress

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:32.031
that I think really hit
home in this project.

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:35.235
The first is that this
product works well because

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.266
we were effectively able to combine

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.820
rigorous engineering science
and analysis with user-centered design

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:45.197
focused on the social and usage
and economic factors

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.734
important to wheelchair users
in the developing countries.

00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:50.222
So I'm an academic at MIT,
and I'm a mechanical engineer,

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:53.770
so I can do things like look at the type
of terrain you want to travel on,

00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:56.418
and figure out how much
resistance it should impose,

00:05:56.442 --> 00:05:59.426
look at the parts we have
available and mix and match them

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.071
to figure out what sort
of gear trains we can use,

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:05.180
and then look at the power and force
you can get out of your upper body

00:06:05.204 --> 00:06:07.143
to analyze how fast you should
be able to go in this chair

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.514
as you put your arms
up and down the levers.

00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:13.173
So as a wet-behind-the-ears
student, excited,

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:15.298
our team made a prototype,

00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:20.173
brought that prototype to Tanzania,
Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:22.307
and found it was terrible

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:24.744
because we didn't get
enough input from users.

00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:27.910
So because we tested it
with wheelchair users,

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:30.416
with wheelchair manufacturers,
we got that feedback from them,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.870
not just articulating their problems,
but articulating their solutions,

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:37.418
and worked together to go back
to the drawing board and make a new design,

00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:39.568
which we brought back
to East Africa in '09

00:06:39.592 --> 00:06:42.413
that worked a lot better than a normal
wheelchair on rough terrain,

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:45.295
but it still didn't work well
indoors because it was too big,

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.293
it was heavy, it was hard to move around,

00:06:47.317 --> 00:06:50.847
so again with that user feedback,
we went back to the drawing board,

00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:53.162
came up with a better
design, 20 pounds lighter,

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:56.853
as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested
that in a field trial in Guatemala,

00:06:56.877 --> 00:06:58.877
and that advanced the product to the point

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.100
where we have now that it's going
into production.

00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:04.346
Now also being engineering scientists,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.228
we were able to quantify the performance
benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,

00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:10.868
so here are some shots
of our trial in Guatemala

00:07:10.892 --> 00:07:14.410
where we tested the LFC
on village terrain,

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.434
and tested people's biomechanical outputs,

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.621
their oxygen consumption,
how fast they go,

00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:20.312
how much power they're putting out,

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:23.211
both in their regular
wheelchairs and using the LFC,

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:25.712
and we found that the LFC
is about 80 percent faster

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:28.070
going on these terrains
than a normal wheelchair.

00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:31.453
It's also about 40 percent more
efficient than a regular wheelchair,

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:33.996
and because of the mechanical
advantage you get from the levers,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.925
you can produce 50 percent higher torque

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.909
and really muscle your way
through the really, really rough terrain.

00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:43.345
Now the second lesson
that we learned in this is that

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:46.245
the constraints on this design
really push the innovation,

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:48.509
because we had to hit
such a low price point,

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:50.819
because we had to make
a device that could travel

00:07:50.843 --> 00:07:53.638
on many, many types of terrain
but still be usable indoors,

00:07:53.662 --> 00:07:55.929
and be simple enough to repair,

00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:58.296
we ended up with a fundamentally
new product,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.412
a new product that is an innovation

00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:03.329
in a space that really hasn't
changed in a hundred years.

00:08:03.353 --> 00:08:06.782
And these are all merits that are not
just good in the developing world.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:09.221
Why not in countries like the U.S. too?

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:10.957
So we teamed up with Continuum,

00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:12.981
a local product design firm here in Boston

00:08:13.005 --> 00:08:15.989
to make the high-end version,
the developed world version,

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:18.775
that we'll probably sell primarily
in the U.S. and Europe,

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.576
but to higher-income buyers.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.562
And the final point I want
to make is that I think

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:27.388
this project worked
well because we engaged

00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:31.999
all the stakeholders that buy into this
project and are important to consider

00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:35.342
in bringing the technology
from inception of an idea

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:39.581
through innovation, validation,
commercialization and dissemination,

00:08:39.605 --> 00:08:43.326
and that cycle has to start
and end with end users.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.101
These are the people that define
the requirements of the technology,

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.439
and these are the people that have
to give the thumbs-up at the end,

00:08:48.463 --> 00:08:51.083
and say, "Yeah, it actually works.
It meets our needs."

00:08:51.107 --> 00:08:53.013
So people like me in the academic space,

00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:56.384
we can do things like innovate
and analyze and test,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:59.480
create data and make
bench-level prototypes,

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:02.647
but how do you get that bench-level
prototype to commercialization?

00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.059
So we need gap-fillers like Continuum
that can work on commercializing,

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.845
and we started a whole NGO
to bring our chair to market --

00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:11.010
Global Research Innovation Technology --

00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:14.742
and then we also teamed up with a big
manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,

00:09:14.766 --> 00:09:17.005
that's tooled up now
to make 500 chairs a month

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.808
and will make the first
batch of 200 next month,

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:20.776
which will be delivered in India.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.515
And then finally, to get this
out to the people in scale,

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.063
we teamed up with the largest
disability organization

00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:28.350
in the world, Jaipur Foot.

00:09:28.374 --> 00:09:30.629
Now what's powerful about this model

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.436
is when you bring together
all these stakeholders

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.405
that represent each link in the chain

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:37.946
from inception of an idea

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.714
all the way to implementation
in the field,

00:09:40.738 --> 00:09:42.265
that's where the magic happens.

00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:44.813
That's where you can take
a guy like me, an academic,

00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:47.841
but analyze and test
and create a new technology

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:51.377
and quantitatively determine
how much better the performance is.

00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:54.062
You can connect with stakeholders
like the manufacturers

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:56.302
and talk with them face-to-face
and leverage their

00:09:56.322 --> 00:09:59.169
local knowledge of manufacturing
practices and their clients

00:09:59.193 --> 00:10:01.908
and combine that knowledge
with our engineering knowledge

00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:05.238
to create something greater
than either of us could have done alone.

00:10:05.262 --> 00:10:07.769
And then you can also engage the end user

00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:10.555
in the design process, and not
just ask him what he needs,

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.504
but ask him how he thinks
it can be achieved.

00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:16.561
And this picture was taken
in India in our last field trial,

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:19.062
where we had a 90-percent
adoption rate where people

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:22.668
switched to using our Leveraged Freedom
Chair over their normal wheelchair,

00:10:22.692 --> 00:10:25.629
and this picture specifically is of Ashok,

00:10:25.653 --> 00:10:28.661
and Ashok had a spinal injury
when he fell out of a tree,

00:10:28.685 --> 00:10:31.543
and he had been working at a tailor,
but once he was injured

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:34.426
he wasn't able to transport
himself from his house

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.226
over a kilometer to his shop
in his normal wheelchair.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.497
The road was too rough.

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:41.418
But the day after he got
an LFC, he hopped in it,

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:43.502
rode that kilometer, opened up his shop

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:46.218
and soon after landed a contract
to make school uniforms

00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:49.338
and started making money, started
providing for his family again.

00:10:49.362 --> 00:10:51.187
Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.

00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:53.911
I rested for a day at home.

00:10:53.935 --> 00:10:58.367
The next day I went to my shop.

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.345
Now everything is back to normal.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:05.430
Amos Winter: And thank you
very much for having me today.

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:09.454
(Applause)
