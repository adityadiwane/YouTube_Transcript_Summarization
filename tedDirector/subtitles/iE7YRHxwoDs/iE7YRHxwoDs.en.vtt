Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.872
So, this is my grandfather,

00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:23.373
Salman Schocken,

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:27.810
who was born into a poor and uneducated family

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.247
with six children to feed,

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:34.943
and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:38.903
drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.

00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:42.323
He never went back to school.

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:46.470
Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.578
of department stores.

00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:51.831
Salman was the consummate perfectionist,

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.395
and every one of his stores was a jewel

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.324
of Bauhaus architecture.

00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:59.514
He was also the ultimate self-learner,

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.417
and like everything else, he did it in grand style.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:05.105
He surrounded himself with an entourage

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:08.492
of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:11.631
and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.556
and he paid each one of them a monthly salary

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:17.607
so that they could write in peace.

00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:22.544
And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.

00:01:22.544 --> 00:01:25.858
He fled Germany, together with his family,

00:01:25.858 --> 00:01:27.947
leaving everything else behind.

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:31.157
His department stores confiscated,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:34.246
he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:36.715
of art and culture.

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:38.654
This high school dropout

00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:40.934
died at the age of 82,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.063
a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.208
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:48.972
and founder of Schocken Books,

00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:52.343
an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:54.013
by Random House.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.989
Such is the power of self-study.

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.505
And these are my parents.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:04.552
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:08.523
They were too busy building a family and a country.

00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:12.551
And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:16.309
tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.472
with thousands of books, records and artwork.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.868
I remember quite vividly my father telling me

00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:27.700
that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.318
then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.347
And that's me,

00:02:35.347 --> 00:02:37.071
I was going to say holding my first abacus,

00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:40.082
but actually holding what my father would consider

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:43.034
an ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:46.696
So one thing that I took from home is this notion

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:49.537
that educators don't necessarily have to teach.

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:52.766
Instead, they can provide an environment and resources

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:57.914
that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.

00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:02.008
Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.328
these are the virtues of a great education.

00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:09.523
So I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.077
self-empowering computer science course

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:16.263
that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.020
As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.438
had an early fascination with first principles,

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:23.960
and over the years, as our knowledge of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.535
science and technology became more sophisticated,

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:30.731
this early awe with the basics

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.831
has only intensified.

00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.530
So it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.012
Noam and I were already computer science professors,

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.764
we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:46.582
As computers became increasingly more complex,

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:49.786
our students were losing the forest for the trees,

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.873
and indeed, it is impossible to connect

00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:55.515
with the soul of the machine if you interact

00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:58.924
with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded

00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:02.300
by numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.990
So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.009
to understand how computers work,

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.097
and understand it in the marrow of their bones,

00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:12.658
then perhaps the best way to go about it

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:17.252
is to have them build a complete, working,

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:20.964
general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,

00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:24.494
from the ground up, from first principles.

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:28.702
Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:32.192
decided to base our cathedral, so to speak,

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:35.331
on the simplest possible building block,

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:38.132
which is something called NAND.

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:42.070
It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.108
with four input-output states.

00:04:45.108 --> 00:04:47.774
So we now start this journey by telling our students

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:49.842
that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) —

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:53.827
and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:57.011
God said, "One step at a time."

00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.104
And then, following this advice, we start

00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:03.063
with this lowly, humble NAND gate,

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:05.003
and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:08.740
of projects in which they gradually build a chip set,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.852
a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:16.429
a basic operating system and a compiler

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:22.618
for a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK."

00:05:22.618 --> 00:05:25.166
The students celebrate the end of this tour de force

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:28.000
by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.992
like Pong, Snake and Tetris.

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:34.607
You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:37.631
with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK

00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:40.421
and then compiled into machine language in a compiler

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:42.829
that you wrote also, and then seeing the result

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:45.712
running on a machine that you built starting

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.996
with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.

00:05:48.996 --> 00:05:52.186
It's a tremendous personal triumph of going

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:56.911
from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.262
and useful system.

00:05:59.262 --> 00:06:03.659
Noam and I worked five years to facilitate

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.867
this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:10.040
that will enable students to build it in one semester.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.079
And this is the great team that helped us make it happen.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:18.326
The trick was to decompose the computer's construction

00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:21.280
into numerous stand-alone modules,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.180
each of which could be individually specified,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.415
built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.

00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:33.404
And from day one, Noam and I decided to put

00:06:33.404 --> 00:06:36.940
all these building blocks freely available in open source

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.420
on the Web.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.891
So chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:46.795
software tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,

00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:50.497
stacks of hundreds of slides, lectures --

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:52.724
we laid out everything on the Web

00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:55.751
and invited the world to come over,

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.287
take whatever they need,

00:06:57.287 --> 00:06:59.677
and do whatever they want with it.

00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:03.576
And then something fascinating happened.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:05.159
The world came.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.317
And in short order, thousands of people

00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:09.861
were building our machine.

00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.785
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first

00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:17.015
massive, open, online courses,

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:19.759
although seven years ago we had no idea that what

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.920
we were doing is called MOOCs.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.778
We just observed how self-organized courses

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.860
were kind of spontaneously spawning

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.243
out of our materials.

00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:33.334
For example, Pramode C.E.,

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:35.243
an engineer from Kerala, India,

00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:37.052
has organized groups of self-learners

00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:40.096
who build our computer under his good guidance.

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:43.118
And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,

00:07:43.118 --> 00:07:45.963
has unbundled our projects into smaller,

00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:47.985
more manageable bites that he now serves

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:51.787
in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.

00:07:51.787 --> 00:07:55.198
The people who are attracted to these courses

00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:57.618
typically have a hacker mentality.

00:07:57.618 --> 00:07:59.723
They want to figure out how things work,

00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:01.483
and they want to do it in groups,

00:08:01.483 --> 00:08:04.294
like this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,

00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:07.959
that uses our materials to offer community courses.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:10.905
And because these materials are widely available

00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:13.599
and open-source, different people take them

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.542
to very different and unpredictable directions.

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:19.455
For example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.301
has used FPGA technology

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.026
to build our computer and show others how to do the same

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:29.389
using a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.990
a very nice computer game that unfolds

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.959
inside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:40.444
3D maze that Ben developed

00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:44.352
using the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.

00:08:44.352 --> 00:08:47.370
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.754
and Ben became an instant media celebrity.

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:53.656
And indeed, for quite a few people,

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:57.733
taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,

00:08:57.733 --> 00:09:00.445
has turned into a life-changing experience.

00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:03.634
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music

00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:06.403
and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.

00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:09.847
A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post

00:09:09.847 --> 00:09:12.467
on our website, and I'd like to read it to you.

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:15.925
So here's what Dan said.

00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:18.737
"I did the coursework because understanding computers

00:09:18.737 --> 00:09:22.083
is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:25.100
and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.809
never been challenged to this degree.

00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:30.196
But given what I now feel capable of doing,

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:32.354
I would certainly do it again.

00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:34.604
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris,

00:09:34.604 --> 00:09:38.350
it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.250
So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.896
who take this course off the Web, on their own traction,

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:52.485
on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:57.072
these people cannot care less about

00:09:57.072 --> 00:09:58.314
grades.

00:09:58.314 --> 00:10:02.219
They are doing it because of one motivation only.

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:05.705
They have a tremendous passion to learn.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.629
And with that in mind,

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:12.233
I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.593
I'm sick of it.

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:16.026
We are obsessed with grades

00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:17.892
because we are obsessed with data,

00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:22.479
and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,

00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:24.955
and a huge part of education

00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:26.546
is about failing.

00:10:26.546 --> 00:10:29.021
Courage, according to Churchill,

00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.967
is the ability to go from one defeat to another

00:10:31.967 --> 00:10:34.581
without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:38.411
And [Joyce] said that mistakes

00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:39.880
are the portals of discovery.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.226
And yet we don't tolerate mistakes,

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.535
and we worship grades.

00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:48.323
So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:51.160
and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.071
which is stamped on your forehead

00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.514
and sums up who you are.

00:10:55.514 --> 00:10:58.797
Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,

00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:01.478
and grading became degrading.

00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:06.379
So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:10.804
and share with you a glimpse from my current project,

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.834
which is different from the previous one,

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:14.848
but it shares exactly the same characteristics

00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:18.675
of self-learning, learning by doing,

00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:21.450
self-exploration and community-building,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:27.310
and this project deals with K-12 math education,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.214
beginning with early age math,

00:11:29.214 --> 00:11:33.707
and we do it on tablets because we believe that

00:11:33.707 --> 00:11:38.112
math, like anything else, should be taught hands on.

00:11:38.112 --> 00:11:41.267
So here's what we do. Basically, we developed

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:45.025
numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining

00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:46.522
a particular concept in math.

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:49.963
So for example, let's take area.

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:52.435
When you deal with a concept like area --

00:11:52.435 --> 00:11:57.679
well, we also provide a set of tools that the child

00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:00.310
is invited to experiment with in order to learn.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.263
So if area is what interests us, then one thing

00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:08.401
which is natural to do is to tile the area

00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:12.051
of this particular shape and simply count

00:12:12.051 --> 00:12:15.914
how many tiles it takes to cover it completely.

00:12:15.914 --> 00:12:18.396
And this little exercise here gives you a first

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:21.825
good insight of the notion of area.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.615
Moving along, what about the area of this figure?

00:12:24.615 --> 00:12:29.272
Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.

00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:31.576
So instead, you can experiment

00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:34.256
with these different tools here by some process

00:12:34.256 --> 00:12:36.295
of guided trial and error,

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:39.133
and at some point you will discover that one thing

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:42.221
that you can do among several legitimate transformations

00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:45.052
is the following one. You can cut the figure,

00:12:45.052 --> 00:12:48.668
you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.785
and then proceed to tile just like we did before.

00:12:51.785 --> 00:12:57.060
(Applause)

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.783
Now this particular transformation

00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:03.767
did not change the area of the original figure,

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:05.954
so a six-year-old who plays with this

00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:08.838
has just discovered a clever algorithm

00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:12.878
to compute the area of any given parallelogram.

00:13:12.878 --> 00:13:14.734
We don't replace teachers, by the way.

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:17.863
We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:21.158
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?

00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:23.953
So after some guided trial and error,

00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:27.888
the child will discover, with or without help,

00:13:27.888 --> 00:13:31.746
that he or she can duplicate the original figure

00:13:31.746 --> 00:13:35.154
and then take the result, transpose it,

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:38.902
glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:46.630
cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.226
and tile.

00:13:48.226 --> 00:13:52.053
Now this transformation has doubled the area

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:55.903
of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:59.669
that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle

00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:02.123
divided by two.

00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:05.571
But we discovered it by self-exploration.

00:14:05.571 --> 00:14:11.651
So, in addition to learning some useful geometry,

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:16.038
the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated

00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:19.065
science strategies, like reduction,

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:21.979
which is the art of

00:14:21.979 --> 00:14:25.565
transforming a complex problem into a simple one,

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:27.934
or generalization, which is at the heart

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:30.777
of any scientific discipline,

00:14:30.777 --> 00:14:33.367
or the fact that some properties are invariant

00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:36.391
under some transformations.

00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:39.676
And all this is something that a very young child

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:43.985
can pick up using such mobile apps.

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:47.079
So presently, we are doing the following:

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:51.388
First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum

00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:54.279
into numerous such apps.

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:56.856
And because we cannot do it on our own,

00:14:56.856 --> 00:14:59.950
we've developed a very fancy authoring tool

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.225
that any author, any parent or actually anyone

00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:05.578
who has an interest in math education,

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:08.850
can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.255
on tablets without programming.

00:15:12.255 --> 00:15:15.475
And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem

00:15:15.475 --> 00:15:18.303
that will match different learners

00:15:18.303 --> 00:15:23.680
with different apps according to their evolving learning style.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.201
The driving force behind this project

00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:29.148
is my colleague Shmulik London,

00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:31.792
and, you see, just like

00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:35.865
Salman did about 90 years ago,

00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:39.836
the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:42.592
because at the end,

00:15:42.592 --> 00:15:44.495
it's all about people.

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:47.914
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:50.744
and I saw this graffiti on a wall,

00:15:50.744 --> 00:15:52.535
and I found it so compelling

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.678
that by now I preach it to my students,

00:15:54.678 --> 00:15:56.944
and I'd like to try to preach it to you.

00:15:56.944 --> 00:15:58.684
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar

00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:00.512
with the term "mensch."

00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:03.120
It basically means to be human

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.055
and to do the right thing.

00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:07.484
And with that, what this graffiti says is,

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:09.570
"High-tech schmigh-tech.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.133
The most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter)

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:15.528
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:20.311
(Applause)
