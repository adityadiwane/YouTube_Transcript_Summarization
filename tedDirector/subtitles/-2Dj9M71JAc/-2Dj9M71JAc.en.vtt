00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:16.971
On the path that American children 
travel to adulthood,

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.519
two institutions oversee the journey.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.262
The first is the one we hear 
a lot about: college.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:26.845
Some of you may remember
the excitement that you felt

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.431
when you first set off for college.

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.983
Some of you may be in college right now

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:34.998
and you're feeling this excitement
at this very moment.

00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:37.667
College has some shortcomings.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:41.003
It's expensive; it leaves
young people in debt.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.947
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:49.114
Young people emerge from college
with pride and with great friends

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:51.453
and with a lot of knowledge 
about the world.

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:53.289
And perhaps most importantly,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.795
a better chance in the labor market
than they had before they got there.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:00.498
Today I want to talk about
the second institution

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:06.056
overseeing the journey from childhood
to adulthood in the United States.

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.811
And that institution is prison.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:14.536
Young people on this journey
are meeting with probation officers

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.939
instead of with teachers.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.832
They're going to court dates
instead of to class.

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:25.909
Their junior year abroad is instead
a trip to a state correctional facility.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.599
And they're emerging from their 20s

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:31.796
not with degrees in business and English,

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.814
but with criminal records.

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.107
This institution is also costing us a lot,

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:38.749
about 40,000 dollars a year

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.517
to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.723
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:49.206
and what kids are getting
is a cold prison cell

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:52.016
and a permanent mark against them
when they come home

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:54.765
and apply for work.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:58.211
There are more and more kids
on this journey to adulthood

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:03.435
than ever before in the United States
and that's because in the past 40 years,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:09.187
our incarceration rate 
has grown by 700 percent.

00:02:09.187 --> 00:02:11.316
I have one slide for this talk.

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:12.570
Here it is.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.623
Here's our incarceration rate,

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:21.915
about 716 people per 100,000
in the population.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:26.065
Here's the OECD countries.

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:33.617
What's more, it's poor kids
that we're sending to prison,

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:37.105
too many drawn from African-American
and Latino communities

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:41.986
so that prison now stands firmly between
the young people trying to make it

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:45.418
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:48.274
The problem's actually 
a bit worse than this

00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:50.952
'cause we're not just sending 
poor kids to prison,

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:53.919
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.240
with probation and parole restrictions,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.127
with low-level warrants,

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.622
we're asking them to live 
in halfway houses and on house arrest,

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:05.227
and we're asking them 
to negotiate a police force

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.640
that is entering poor
communities of color,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.839
not for the purposes 
of promoting public safety,

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.315
but to make arrest counts,
to line city coffers.

00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:22.925
This is the hidden underside to our
historic experiment in punishment:

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:27.971
young people worried that at any moment,
they will be stopped, searched and seized.

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:31.258
Not just in the streets, 
but in their homes,

00:03:31.258 --> 00:03:33.695
at school and at work.

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:38.116
I got interested in this 
other path to adulthood

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.357
when I was myself a college student

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:42.415
attending the University of Pennsylvania

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:44.493
in the early 2000s.

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:48.060
Penn sits within a historic 
African-American neighborhood.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.298
So you've got these two parallel
journeys going on simultaneously:

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:56.419
the kids attending 
this elite, private university,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.885
and the kids from 
the adjacent neighborhood,

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:00.813
some of whom are making it to college,

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.311
and many of whom 
are being shipped to prison.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:09.415
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
a young woman who was in high school

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.409
who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.942
Soon, her cousin came home 
from a juvenile detention center.

00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:18.600
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.259
I began to get to know him 
and his friends and family,

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.611
and I asked him what he thought 
about me writing about his life

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.196
for my senior thesis in college.

00:04:28.196 --> 00:04:32.387
This senior thesis became
a dissertation at Princeton

00:04:32.387 --> 00:04:33.935
and now a book.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.533
By the end of my sophomore year,

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:38.903
I moved into the neighborhood
and I spent the next six years

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:43.494
trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age.

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:46.318
The first week I spent
in this neighborhood,

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:48.894
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:50.386
play this game of chase,

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:53.337
where the older boy
ran after the other boy.

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:54.532
He played the cop.

00:04:54.532 --> 00:04:56.720
When the cop caught up
to the younger boy,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.420
he pushed him down,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.971
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:03.282
took a quarter out of 
the other child's pocket,

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:06.874
saying, "I'm seizing that."

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:10.214
He asked the child if 
he was carrying any drugs

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:12.659
or if he had a warrant.

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.664
Many times, I saw this game repeated,

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:17.052
sometimes children would 
simply give up running,

00:05:17.052 --> 00:05:19.248
and stick their bodies flat 
against the ground

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:22.593
with their hands above their heads,
or flat up against a wall.

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:24.588
Children would yell at each other,

00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:25.870
"I'm going to lock you up,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.052
I'm going to lock you up
and you're never coming home!"

00:05:29.052 --> 00:05:33.406
Once I saw a six-year-old child
pull another child's pants down

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:35.816
and try to do a cavity search.

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:39.935
In the first 18 months that I lived
in this neighborhood,

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:43.627
I wrote down every time I saw
any contact between police

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:46.173
and people that were my neighbors.

00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:48.652
So in the first 18 months,

00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:52.421
I watched the police stop 
pedestrians or people in cars,

00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:54.589
search people, run people's names,

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.533
chase people through the streets,

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:58.306
pull people in for questioning,

00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:02.489
or make an arrest every single day,
with five exceptions.

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:07.077
Fifty-two times, I watched the police
break down doors,

00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:09.118
chase people through houses

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.337
or make an arrest of someone
in their home.

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:15.150
Fourteen times
in this first year and a half,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.450
I watched the police punch, choke,
kick, stomp on or beat young men

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.269
after they had caught them.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.665
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

00:06:26.665 --> 00:06:28.209
Chuck and Tim.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.250
Chuck was 18 when we met,
a senior in high school.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.798
He was playing on the basketball team
and making C's and B's.

00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:36.697
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.848
And Tim loved Chuck;
he followed him around a lot,

00:06:39.848 --> 00:06:42.139
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.285
They lived with their mom and grandfather

00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:47.724
in a two-story row home 
with a front lawn and a back porch.

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:51.385
Their mom was struggling with addiction
all while the boys were growing up.

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:55.233
She never really was able 
to hold down a job for very long.

00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:58.281
It was their grandfather's pension
that supported the family,

00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:01.484
not really enough to pay
for food and clothes

00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:04.215
and school supplies for growing boys.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.401
The family was really struggling.

00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:08.780
So when we met, Chuck was
a senior in high school.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.898
He had just turned 18.

00:07:11.628 --> 00:07:14.770
That winter, a kid in the schoolyard

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.029
called Chuck's mom a crack whore.

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.904
Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:24.729
and the school cops charged him 
with aggravated assault.

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.479
The other kid was fine the next day,

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.952
I think it was his pride that was injured
more than anything.

00:07:29.952 --> 00:07:31.665
But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

00:07:31.665 --> 00:07:34.853
this agg. assault case sent him 
to adult county jail

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:37.278
on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:41.345
where he sat, unable to pay the bail --
he couldn't afford it --

00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.544
while the trial dates 
dragged on and on and on

00:07:44.544 --> 00:07:47.266
through almost his entire senior year.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.976
Finally, near the end of this season,

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:54.323
the judge on this assault case
threw out most of the charges

00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:55.657
and Chuck came home

00:07:55.657 --> 00:08:00.004
with only a few hundred dollars' worth
of court fees hanging over his head.

00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:02.547
Tim was pretty happy that day.

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:05.301
The next fall, Chuck tried 
to re-enroll as a senior,

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.315
but the school secretary told him that

00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:10.446
he was then 19 and too old 
to be readmitted.

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:14.113
Then the judge on his assault case
issued him a warrant for his arrest

00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:17.388
because he couldn't pay 
the 225 dollars in court fees

00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:20.915
that came due a few weeks after
the case ended.

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:24.935
Then he was a high school dropout
living on the run.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:26.987
Tim's first arrest came later that year

00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:28.770
after he turned 11.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.900
Chuck had managed
to get his warrant lifted

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.561
and he was on a payment plan
for the court fees

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:37.071
and he was driving Tim to school
in his girlfriend's car.

00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:39.806
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:43.591
and the car comes up 
as stolen in California.

00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:47.714
Chuck had no idea where in the history
of this car it had been stolen.

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:51.190
His girlfriend's uncle bought it
from a used car auction

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.657
in northeast Philly.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.485
Chuck and Tim had never been
outside of the tri-state,

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:57.834
let alone to California.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.932
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

00:08:59.932 --> 00:09:03.500
charged Chuck with 
receiving stolen property.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.312
And then a juvenile judge, 
a few days later,

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.464
charged Tim, age 11,

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:11.537
with accessory to receiving
a stolen property

00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:15.190
and then he was placed on 
three years of probation.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.332
With this probation sentence 
hanging over his head,

00:09:19.332 --> 00:09:21.419
Chuck sat his little brother down

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:24.868
and began teaching him
how to run from the police.

00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:27.200
They would sit side by side 
on their back porch

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.264
looking out into the shared alleyway

00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:33.104
and Chuck would coach Tim
how to spot undercover cars,

00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:38.071
how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
how and where to hide.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.691
I want you to imagine for a second

00:09:40.691 --> 00:09:43.060
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.809
if they were living in a neighborhood
where kids were going to college,

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:49.238
not prison.

00:09:49.918 --> 00:09:53.071
A neighborhood like the one 
I got to grow up in.

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:54.536
Okay, you might say.

00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:58.288
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
they're committing crimes!

00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:00.414
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

00:10:00.414 --> 00:10:04.228
Don't they deserve to be 
living in fear of arrest?

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:07.350
Well, my answer would be no.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.430
They don't.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.457
And certainly not for the same things 
that other young people

00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:14.901
with more privilege are doing
with impunity.

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:16.718
If Chuck had gone to my high school,

00:10:16.718 --> 00:10:19.041
that schoolyard fight 
would have ended there,

00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:20.717
as a schoolyard fight.

00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:24.267
It never would have become
an aggravated assault case.

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:27.758
Not a single kid that
I went to college with

00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:29.437
has a criminal record right now.

00:10:29.437 --> 00:10:31.311
Not a single one.

00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:35.316
But can you imagine how many might have
if the police had stopped those kids

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:39.183
and searched their pockets for drugs
as they walked to class?

00:10:39.183 --> 00:10:43.244
Or had raided their frat parties
in the middle of the night?

00:10:44.384 --> 00:10:45.656
Okay, you might say.

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:47.646
But doesn't this high incarceration rate

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:50.399
partly account for our 
really low crime rate?

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.823
Crime is down. That's a good thing.

00:10:52.823 --> 00:10:55.310
Totally, that is a good thing.
Crime is down.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.837
It dropped precipitously in
the '90s and through the 2000s.

00:10:58.837 --> 00:11:00.882
But according to a committee of academics

00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:04.536
convened by the National Academy
of Sciences last year,

00:11:04.536 --> 00:11:08.545
the relationship between our
historically high incarceration rates

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:12.129
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:15.569
It turns out that the crime rate
goes up and down

00:11:15.569 --> 00:11:20.095
irrespective of how many young people
we send to prison.

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:24.358
We tend to think about justice
in a pretty narrow way:

00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:27.962
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

00:11:27.962 --> 00:11:31.317
Injustice is about being 
wrongfully convicted.

00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:33.632
So if you're convicted 
of something you did do,

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:35.467
you should be punished for it.

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.233
There are innocent and guilty people,

00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:39.670
there are victims and 
there are perpetrators.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.071
Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:48.505
Right now, we're asking kids who live
in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:50.786
who have the least amount
of family resources,

00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:53.347
who are attending 
the country's worst schools,

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:56.253
who are facing the toughest time
in the labor market,

00:11:56.253 --> 00:11:59.906
who are living in neighborhoods
where violence is an everyday problem,

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:04.479
we're asking these kids to walk
the thinnest possible line --

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:08.290
to basically never do anything wrong.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.791
Why are we not providing support
to young kids facing these challenges?

00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:20.037
Why are we offering only handcuffs,
jail time and this fugitive existence?

00:12:20.037 --> 00:12:22.543
Can we imagine something better?

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:26.798
Can we imagine a criminal justice system
that prioritizes recovery,

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:29.385
prevention, civic inclusion,

00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:32.086
rather than punishment?

00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:35.475
(Applause)

00:12:39.855 --> 00:12:42.130
A criminal justice system 
that acknowledges

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.110
the legacy of exclusion that poor people
of color in the U.S. have faced

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.266
and that does not promote
and perpetuate those exclusions.

00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:53.651
(Applause)

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:59.853
And finally, a criminal justice system
that believes in black young people,

00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:03.717
rather than treating black young people 
as the enemy to be rounded up.

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:07.440
(Applause)

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.287
The good news is that we already are.

00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:19.110
A few years ago, Michelle Alexander
wrote "The New Jim Crow,"

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.123
which got Americans to see 
incarceration as a civil rights issue

00:13:23.123 --> 00:13:27.479
of historic proportions in a way
they had not seen it before.

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:31.238
President Obama and Attorney General 
Eric Holder have come out very strongly

00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:32.955
on sentencing reform,

00:13:32.955 --> 00:13:36.699
on the need to address 
racial disparity in incarceration.

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.309
We're seeing states throw out
Stop and Frisk

00:13:39.309 --> 00:13:42.345
as the civil rights violation that it is.

00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:47.400
We're seeing cities and states
decriminalize possession of marijuana.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.257
New York, New Jersey
and California

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:53.094
have been dropping their 
prison populations, closing prisons,

00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:55.375
while also seeing a big drop in crime.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.068
Texas has gotten into the game now,

00:13:57.068 --> 00:14:00.913
also closing prisons, 
investing in education.

00:14:00.913 --> 00:14:04.570
This curious coalition is building 
from the right and the left,

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.018
made up of former prisoners
and fiscal conservatives,

00:14:08.018 --> 00:14:11.349
of civil rights activists
and libertarians,

00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:15.329
of young people taking to the streets
to protest police violence

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:18.165
against unarmed black teenagers,

00:14:18.165 --> 00:14:20.211
and older, wealthier people --

00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:22.082
some of you are here in the audience --

00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:26.017
pumping big money into 
decarceration initiatives

00:14:27.357 --> 00:14:29.107
In a deeply divided Congress,

00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:31.810
the work of reforming 
our criminal justice system

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.602
is just about the only thing
that the right and the left

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:37.187
are coming together on.

00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:41.101
I did not think I would see
this political moment in my lifetime.

00:14:41.102 --> 00:14:44.710
I think many of the people
who have been working tirelessly

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.872
to write about the causes and consequences

00:14:46.872 --> 00:14:49.104
of our historically 
high incarceration rates

00:14:49.104 --> 00:14:52.870
did not think we would see
this moment in our lifetime.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.653
The question for us now is,
how much can we make of it?

00:14:56.653 --> 00:14:59.618
How much can we change?

00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:02.182
I want to end with a call to young people,

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:03.816
the young people attending college

00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:06.926
and the young people
struggling to stay out of prison

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:10.030
or to make it through prison
and return home.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.063
It may seem like these paths
to adulthood are worlds apart,

00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:18.505
but the young people participating
in these two institutions

00:15:18.505 --> 00:15:20.430
conveying us to adulthood,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.995
they have one thing in common:

00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:27.677
Both can be leaders in the work
of reforming our criminal justice system.

00:15:28.483 --> 00:15:31.815
Young people have always been leaders
in the fight for equal rights,

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:34.080
the fight for more people 
to be granted dignity

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.635
and a fighting chance at freedom.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:39.014
The mission for the generation 
of young people

00:15:39.014 --> 00:15:43.994
coming of age in this, a sea-change
moment, potentially,

00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:49.258
is to end mass incarceration and 
build a new criminal justice system,

00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:52.185
emphasis on the word justice.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.589
Thanks.

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:57.168
(Applause)
