00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
on a collective level.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
that we're in denial about,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
It's like when you're mean to your wife

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160
because you're mad at somebody else.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And when we do these kind of things,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
that nobody wants, and no one intended.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And that's what I look at with my photographic work.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
This is an image I just recently completed, that is --

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
when you stand back at a distance,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
of a factory spewing out pollution.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And as you get a little bit closer,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And as you get all the way up close,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
in the United States every six hours.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
We use four million cups a day on airline flights,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
They just don't do that in that industry.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Now, that number is dwarfed

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
by the number of paper cups we use every day,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160
most of which is coffee.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160
that's the size it would be.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
And there's an hour's worth of our cups.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
And there's a day's worth of our cups.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
You can still see the little people way down there.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
That's as high as a 42-story building,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
Speaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
that I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
has the largest percentage of its population in prison

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
of any country on Earth.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
are Americans, imprisoned in our country.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
And I wanted to show the number.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
and in the actual print of this piece,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
that was larger than any printer in the world would print.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.160
This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
those are my parents looking at the piece.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
(Laughter)

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
Every time I look at this piece,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
"He finally folded his laundry."

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160
(Laughter)

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
who die from cigarette smoking.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
from smoking cigarettes.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
And, as you slowly step back,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.160
you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
And do you remember the response?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
It reverberated around the world,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
and will continue to reverberate through time.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160
And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
And this is what the next piece is about.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
which is equal to the number of teenagers

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.160
More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
begin smoking every year.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
One more strange epidemic in the United States

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
that I want to acquaint you with

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
that I scanned lots and lots of times.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
(Laughter)

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
which is the number of hospital emergency room visits

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
yearly in the United States,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160
and anti-anxiety medications.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160
One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.160
A strange phenomenon.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
This is a piece that I just recently completed

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
384,000 women, American women, last year

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
went in for elective breast augmentation surgery.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
given to young girls who are about to go off to college.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.160
and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
that are performed in the U.S. each month.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.160
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
And strangely enough, the only plastic surgery

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
and most of that is being done by men.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
They're just examples.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:31.160
We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
about what's going on in our culture right now,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
what's going on in our country,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
And one of the causes of this, I think,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
this holoptical worldview, this holographic image

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
that we're all trying to create in our mind

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
the social consequences 10,000 miles away

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
of the daily decisions that we make as consumers.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
As we try to build this view,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.160
the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
in the billions and now in the trillions.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160
is to take these numbers, these statistics

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160
from the raw language of data, and to translate them

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
if we can feel these things more deeply,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
then they'll matter to us more than they do now.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And if we can find that,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
what it is that we need to find to face the big question,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
which is: how do we change?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
how do we change? How do we change as a culture,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
and how do we each individually take responsibility

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160
and that is our own behavior?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:39.160
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
to look at these issues.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And if there are things that we see

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.160
that we don't like about our culture,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
then we have a choice.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.160
The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
as we show up for the question of how do we change --

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.160
it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
and it will continue to do that, on into the future.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.160
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160
of the billions of people

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.160
who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
I'm not speaking abstractly about this,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:55.160
I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
right now, in this moment.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Thank you and good afternoon.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.160
(Applause)
