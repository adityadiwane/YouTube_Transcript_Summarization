00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.695
I remember the very first time
I went to a nice restaurant,

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.336
a really nice restaurant.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.496
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.976
and I remember beforehand
the waitress walked around

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.856
and asked whether we wanted some wine,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.000
so I said, "Sure,
I'll take some white wine."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.536
And she immediately said,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.000
"Would you like sauvignon blanc
or chardonnay?"

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.616
And I remember thinking,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.496
"Come on, lady,
stop with the fancy French words

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.240
and just give me some white wine."

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.016
But I used my powers of deduction

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.456
and recognized that chardonnay
and sauvignon blanc

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.376
were two separate types of white wine,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.816
and so I told her
that I would take the chardonnay,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.698
because frankly that was
the easiest one to pronounce for me.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.056
So I had a lot of experiences like that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.760
during my first couple of years
as a law student at Yale,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.720
because, despite all outward appearances,
I'm a cultural outsider.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.816
I didn't come from the elites.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.176
I didn't come from the Northeast
or from San Francisco.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.296
I came from a southern Ohio steel town,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.056
and it's a town that's really
struggling in a lot of ways,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.536
ways that are indicative
of the broader struggles

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.000
of America's working class.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.056
Heroin has moved in,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.120
killing a lot of people, people I know.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.640
Family violence, domestic violence,
and divorce have torn apart families.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.576
And there's a very unique
sense of pessimism that's moved in.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.216
Think about rising mortality rates
in these communities

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.416
and recognize that
for a lot of these folks,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.016
the problems that they're seeing

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.736
are actually causing rising death rates
in their own communities,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.160
so there's a very real sense of struggle.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.696
I had a very front-row seat
to that struggle.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.840
My family has been part of that struggle
for a very long time.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.416
I come from a family
that doesn't have a whole lot of money.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.856
The addiction that plagued my community

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.000
also plagued my family,
and even, sadly, my own mom.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.896
There were a lot of problems
that I saw in my own family,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.776
problems caused sometimes
by a lack of money,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.136
problems caused sometimes by a lack
of access to resources and social capital

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.200
that really affected my life.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.176
If you had looked at my life
when I was 14 years old

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.256
and said, "Well, what's going
to happen to this kid?"

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.136
you would have concluded
that I would have struggled

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.680
with what academics call upward mobility.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.536
So upward mobility is an abstract term,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.296
but it strikes at something
that's very core

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.016
at the heart of the American Dream.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.256
It's the sense,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.056
and it measures whether kids like me

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.096
who grow up in poor communities
are going to live a better life,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.496
whether they're going to have a chance
to live a materially better existence,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.056
or whether they're going to stay
in the circumstances where they came from.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.496
And one of the things
we've learned, unfortunately,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.456
is that upward mobility isn't as high
as we'd like it to be in this country,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.480
and interestingly,
it's very geographically distributed.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.040
So take Utah, for instance.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.376
In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.536
very likely to live their share
and their part in the American Dream.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.416
But if you think of where I'm from,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.376
in the South, in Appalachia,
in southern Ohio,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.616
it's very unlikely
that kids like that will rise.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.896
The American Dream
in those parts of the country

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.960
is in a very real sense just a dream.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.160
So why is that happening?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.936
So one reason is obviously
economic or structural.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.496
So you think of these areas.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.136
They're beset by these
terrible economic trends,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.776
built around industries
like coal and steel

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.840
that make it harder
for folks to get ahead.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.896
That's certainly one problem.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.416
There's also the problem of brain drain,
where the really talented people,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.816
because they can't find
high-skilled work at home,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.096
end up moving elsewhere,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.136
so they don't build a business
or non-profit where they're from,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.136
they end up going elsewhere
and taking their talents with them.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.816
There are failing schools
in a lot of these communities,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.896
failing to give kids
the educational leg up

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.456
that really makes it possible for kids
to have opportunities later in life.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.016
These things are all important.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.456
I don't mean to discount
these structural barriers.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.816
But when I look back at my life
and my community,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.720
something else was going on,
something else mattered.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.120
It's difficult to quantify,
but it was no less real.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.776
So for starters, there was
a very real sense of hopelessness

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.576
in the community that I grew up in.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.736
There was a sense that kids had
that their choices didn't matter.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.416
No matter what happened,
no matter how hard they worked,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.536
no matter how hard
they tried to get ahead,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.200
nothing good would happen.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.216
So that's a tough feeling
to grow up around.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.416
That's a tough mindset to penetrate,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.720
and it leads sometimes
to very conspiratorial places.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.176
So let's just take one
political issue that's pretty hot,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.696
affirmative action.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.016
So depending on your politics,
you might think that affirmative action

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.416
is either a wise or an unwise way
to promote diversity in the workplace

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.736
or the classroom.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.776
But if you grow up in an area like this,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.536
you see affirmative action
as a tool to hold people like you back.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.816
That's especially true if you're
a member of the white working class.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.256
You see it as something
that isn't just about good or bad policy.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.976
You see it as something
that's actively conspiring,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.256
where people with political
and financial power

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.896
are working against you.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.840
And there are a lot of ways that you see
that conspiracy against you --

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.416
perceived, real, but it's there,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.080
and it warps expectations.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.256
So if you think about what do you do
when you grow up in that world,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.016
you can respond in a couple of ways.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.216
One, you can say,
"I'm not going to work hard,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.136
because no matter how hard I work,
it's not going to matter."

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.816
Another thing you might do is say,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.056
"Well, I'm not going to go
after the traditional markers of success,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.416
like a university education
or a prestigious job,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.336
because the people who care
about those things are unlike me.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.980
They're never going to let me in."

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:55.481
When I got admitted to Yale,
a family member asked me

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:58.816
if I had pretended to be a liberal
to get by the admissions committee.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.616
Seriously.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.656
And it's obviously not the case
that there was a liberal box to check

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.176
on the application,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.856
but it speaks to a very real
insecurity in these places

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.256
that you have to pretend
to be somebody you're not

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.480
to get past these various social barriers.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.604
It's a very significant problem.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.056
Even if you don't give in
to that hopelessness,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.896
even if you think, let's say,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.536
that your choices matter
and you want to make the good choices,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.456
you want to do better
for yourself and for your family,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.656
it's sometimes hard
to even know what those choices are

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.776
when you grow up
in a community like I did.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.416
I didn't know, for example,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.680
that you had to go
to law school to be a lawyer.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.296
I didn't know that elite universities,
as research consistently tells us,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.096
are cheaper for low-income kids

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.696
because these universities
have bigger endowments,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.896
can offer more generous financial aid.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.176
I remember I learned this

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.016
when I got the financial aid letter
from Yale for myself,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.736
tens of thousands of dollars
in need-based aid,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.896
which is a term I had never heard before.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.576
But I turned to my aunt
when I got that letter and said,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.896
"You know, I think this just means
that for the first time in my life,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.520
being poor has paid really well."

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.176
So I didn't have access
to that information

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.856
because the social networks around me
didn't have access to that information.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.536
I learned from my community
how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.016
I learned how to make
a damn good biscuit recipe.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.200
The trick, by the way,
is frozen butter, not warm butter.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.976
But I didn't learn how to get ahead.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.576
I didn't learn how to make
the good decisions

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.456
about education and opportunity

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.176
that you need to make

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.376
to actually have a chance
in this 21st century knowledge economy.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.536
Economists call the value
that we gain from our informal networks,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.176
from our friends and colleagues
and family "social capital."

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.016
The social capital that I had
wasn't built for 21st century America,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.240
and it showed.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.296
There's something else
that's really important that's going on

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.496
that our community
doesn't like to talk about,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.096
but it's very real.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.016
Working-class kids are much more likely

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.776
to face what's called
adverse childhood experiences,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.520
which is just a fancy word
for childhood trauma:

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.856
getting hit or yelled at,
put down by a parent repeatedly,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.296
watching someone hit or beat your parent,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.696
watching someone do drugs
or abuse alcohol.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.256
These are all instances
of childhood trauma,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.360
and they're pretty
commonplace in my family.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.376
Importantly, they're not just
commonplace in my family right now.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.416
They're also multigenerational.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.000
So my grandparents,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.416
the very first time that they had kids,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.136
they expected that they
were going to raise them in a way

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.776
that was uniquely good.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.056
They were middle class,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.461
they were able to earn
a good wage in a steel mill.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.816
But what ended up happening

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.856
is that they exposed their kids
to a lot of the childhood trauma

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.576
that had gone back many generations.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.360
My mom was 12 when she saw
my grandma set my grandfather on fire.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.936
His crime was that he came home drunk

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.176
after she told him,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.360
"If you come home drunk,
I'm gonna kill you."

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.440
And she tried to do it.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.920
Think about the way
that that affects a child's mind.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.456
And we think of these things
as especially rare,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.456
but a study by the Wisconsin
Children's Trust Fund found

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.160
that 40 percent of low-income kids face
multiple instances of childhood trauma,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.096
compared to only 29 percent
for upper-income kids.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.776
And think about what that really means.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.536
If you're a low-income kid,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.016
almost half of you face multiple
instances of childhood trauma.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.856
This is not an isolated problem.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.000
This is a very significant issue.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.920
We know what happens
to the kids who experience that life.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.216
They're more likely to do drugs,
more likely to go to jail,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.536
more likely to drop out of high school,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.976
and most importantly,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.216
they're more likely
to do to their children

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.080
what their parents did to them.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.736
This trauma, this chaos in the home,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.216
is our culture's
very worst gift to our children,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.760
and it's a gift that keeps on giving.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.096
So you combine all that,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.816
the hopelessness, the despair,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.176
the cynicism about the future,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.440
the childhood trauma,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.336
the low social capital,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.656
and you begin to understand why me,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.256
at the age of 14,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.616
was ready to become
just another statistic,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.960
another kid who failed to beat the odds.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.336
But something unexpected happened.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.096
I did beat the odds.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.256
Things turned up for me.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.016
I graduated from high school,
from college, I went to law school,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.640
and I have a pretty good job now.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.520
So what happened?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.856
Well, one thing that happened
is that my grandparents,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.416
the same grandparents
of setting someone on fire fame,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.680
they really shaped up
by the time I came around.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.376
They provided me a stable home,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.696
a stable family.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.936
They made sure

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.096
that when my parents weren't able
to do the things that kids need,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.000
they stepped in and filled that role.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.536
My grandma especially
did two things that really matter.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.056
One, she provided that peaceful home
that allowed me to focus on homework

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.696
and the things that kids
should be focused on.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.096
But she was also
this incredibly perceptive woman,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.496
despite not even having
a middle school education.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.176
She recognized the message
that my community had for me,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.256
that my choices didn't matter,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.096
that the deck was stacked against me.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.336
She once told me,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.336
"JD, never be like those losers who think
the deck is stacked against them.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.696
You can do anything you want to."

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.936
And yet she recognized
that life wasn't fair.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.576
It's hard to strike that balance,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.616
to tell a kid that life isn't fair,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.896
but also recognize and enforce in them
the reality that their choices matter.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.040
But mamaw was able
to strike that balance.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.336
The other thing that really helped
was the United States Marine Corps.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.856
So we think of the Marine Corps
as a military outfit, and of course it is,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.736
but for me, the US Marine Corps
was a four-year crash course

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.976
in character education.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.376
It taught me how to make a bed,
how to do laundry,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.656
how to wake up early,
how to manage my finances.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.856
These are things
my community didn't teach me.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.833
I remember when I went
to go buy a car for the very first time,

00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:06.176
I was offered a dealer's
low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.800
and I was ready
to sign on the dotted line.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.536
But I didn't take that deal,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.576
because I went and took it to my officer

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.736
who told me, "Stop being an idiot,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.256
go to the local credit union,
and get a better deal."

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.736
And so that's what I did.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.176
But without the Marine Corps,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.456
I would have never had access
to that knowledge.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.680
I would have had
a financial calamity, frankly.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.856
The last thing I want to say
is that I had a lot of good fortune

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.456
in the mentors and people

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.616
who have played
an important role in my life.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.696
From the Marines,
from Ohio State, from Yale,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.976
from other places,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.656
people have really stepped in

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.496
and ensured that they filled
that social capital gap

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.920
that it was pretty obvious,
apparently, that I had.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.040
That comes from good fortune,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.136
but a lot of children
aren't going to have that good fortune,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.856
and I think that raises
really important questions for all of us

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.642
about how we're going to change that.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.576
We need to ask questions about
how we're going to give low-income kids

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.136
who come from a broken home
access to a loving home.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.416
We need to ask questions

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.776
about how we're going
to teach low-income parents

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.936
how to better interact
with their children,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.456
with their partners.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.936
We need to ask questions
about how we give social capital,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.336
mentorship to low-income kids
who don't have it.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.416
We need to think about
how we teach working class children

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.936
about not just hard skills,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.056
like reading, mathematics,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.416
but also soft skills,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.280
like conflict resolution
and financial management.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.656
Now, I don't have all of the answers.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.600
I don't know all of the solutions
to this problem,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.560
but I do know this:

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.336
in southern Ohio right now,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.136
there's a kid who is
anxiously awaiting their dad,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.536
wondering whether,
when he comes through the door,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.960
he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.200
There's a kid

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.896
whose mom sticks a needle in her arm

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.416
and passes out,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.336
and he doesn't know
why she doesn't cook him dinner,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.160
and he goes to bed hungry that night.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.336
There's a kid who has
no hope for the future

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.616
but desperately
wants to live a better life.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.840
They just want somebody
to show it to them.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.536
I don't have all the answers,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.496
but I know that unless our society
starts asking better questions

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.616
about why I was so lucky

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.696
and about how to get that luck
to more of our communities

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.376
and our country's children,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.656
we're going to continue
to have a very significant problem.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.896
Thank you.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.320
(Applause)
