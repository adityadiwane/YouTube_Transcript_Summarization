00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.085
So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.688
he told me several months ago

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.756
exactly what this month would be like.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.670
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.276
it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.036
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:34.861
but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:39.078
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:41.698
so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of

00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:44.918
angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,

00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:47.667
reports of phone calls that aren't going well,

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.829
people saying nothing's happening at all,

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.375
and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.983
we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:59.571
He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.005
and I got an email from him today saying, all right,

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.984
we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:07.660
that they're going to resolve it.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.204
And it made me think. I love studying

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.197
these moments in American history

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:16.097
when there was this frenzy of partisan anger,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:19.238
that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.

00:01:19.238 --> 00:01:23.478
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton

00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:27.039
and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.360
and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.604
saying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:34.403
or else the dollar will have no value.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:36.028
This economy won't work,"

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.437
and Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:42.225
They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:47.747
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:51.397
and at every moment, different partisans saying,

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:53.585
"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.734
and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:58.958
on whatever it is we wanted to buy.

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.691
To give you a quick primer on where we are,

00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.470
a quick refresher on where we are.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.034
So the fiscal cliff, I was told

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.500
that that's too partisan a thing to say,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.922
although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:14.283
People say we should call it the fiscal slope,

00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:16.329
or we should call it an austerity crisis,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.715
but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:21.492
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:26.189
arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.816
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:34.174
So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.536
of our overall economy, of GDP.

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:39.904
The light blue dotted line represents

00:02:39.904 --> 00:02:42.033
the Congressional Budget Office's best guess

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.108
of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,

00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:49.624
and as you can see, sometime around 2027,

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.912
we reach Greek levels of debt,

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.800
somewhere around 130 percent of GDP,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.160
which tells you that some time in the next 20 years,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.530
if Congress does absolutely nothing,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.204
we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.805
the world's bond buyers, are going to say,

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:08.595
"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:10.634
except at really high interest rates."

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:13.500
And at that moment our economy collapses.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.349
But remember, Greece is there today.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.251
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time

00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:21.472
to avoid that crisis,

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:25.167
and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:28.704
at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:32.112
Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.056
The dark blue line is how much the government spends.

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:38.513
The light blue line is how much the government gets in.

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:41.273
And as you can see, for most of recent history,

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:44.905
except for a brief period, we have consistently spent

00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:48.105
more than we take in. Thus the national debt.

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:51.984
But as you can also see, projected going forward,

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:55.000
the gap widens a bit and raises a bit,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.049
and this graph is only through 2021.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.712
It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:04.837
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:07.926
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:12.044
We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:14.300
especially if we raise taxes on the rich.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.923
The Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.362
Why don't we lower both lines?

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:22.317
Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:25.766
and then we'll be on an even more favorable

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.245
long-term deficit trajectory?

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:32.824
And behind this powerful disagreement between

00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:34.604
how to close that gap,

00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:37.989
there's the worst kind of cynical party politics,

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:43.362
the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:47.623
but there's also this powerfully interesting,

00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.056
respectful disagreement between

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.583
two fundamentally different economic philosophies.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:58.406
And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:03.537
see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.848
well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:11.326
Unfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:14.179
but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.275
every bit of human endeavor and taking resources,

00:05:19.275 --> 00:05:21.624
money, labor, capital, machinery,

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:25.874
away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,

00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:27.470
and while this might cause temporary dislocation,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.964
what it does is it builds up the more productive areas

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.594
and lets the less productive areas fade away and die,

00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:36.370
and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.708
so much richer for everybody.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:42.621
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government,

00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:45.441
a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying

00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:47.690
and cheating and hurting each other,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.994
maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department

00:05:50.994 --> 00:05:53.994
and an army, but to have a very limited reach

00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:56.994
into the mechanisms of this machinery.

00:05:56.994 --> 00:06:01.170
And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.138
economists picture this economy,

00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:06.694
most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:09.434
they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:13.554
It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.

00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:17.470
But that system has tons of problems.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.799
Wealth piles up in the wrong places.

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:24.073
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:26.941
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.

00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:29.813
That machine doesn't care about the environment,

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:31.879
about racism, about all these issues

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.677
that make this life worse for all of us,

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:37.756
and so the government does have a role to take resources

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:41.037
from more productive uses, or from richer sources,

00:06:41.037 --> 00:06:43.705
and give them to other sources.

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:48.760
And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.818
you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,

00:06:52.818 --> 00:06:56.807
because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:59.575
the more each side thinks they know the answer

00:06:59.575 --> 00:07:02.928
and the other side is just going to ruin everything.

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:06.063
And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot

00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:09.126
of the last few years really depressed about this,

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:12.175
until this year, I learned something that

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:15.655
I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:18.516
and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:20.021
people won't believe me.

00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:21.339
But here's what I learned.

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.759
The American people, taken as a whole,

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.959
when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:30.682
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:32.947
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:34.380
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.961
But let me explain what I'm thinking.

00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:40.258
When you look at how the federal government spends money,

00:07:40.258 --> 00:07:42.832
so this is the battle right here,

00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:45.525
55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:47.893
Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,

00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:50.912
20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:52.818
and six percent interest.

00:07:52.818 --> 00:07:57.536
So when we're talking about cutting government spending,

00:07:57.536 --> 00:07:59.542
this is the pie we're talking about,

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:03.129
and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.662
what party they're in, overwhelmingly like

00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:09.101
that big 55 percent chunk.

00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:11.093
They like Social Security. They like Medicare.

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:14.621
They even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,

00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:17.045
which you might think would have less support.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:20.996
And they do not want it fundamentally touched,

00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:25.187
although the American people are remarkably comfortable,

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:28.099
and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:32.864
with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.

00:08:32.864 --> 00:08:35.625
Social Security is fairly easy to fix.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:39.409
The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.703
So gradually raise Social Security retirement age,

00:08:41.703 --> 00:08:44.076
maybe only on people not yet born.

00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:46.501
Americans are about 50/50,

00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:48.497
whether they're Democrats or Republicans.

00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:50.849
Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,

00:08:50.849 --> 00:08:54.170
seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.185
People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.

00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:01.492
Raise medical health care contributions?

00:09:01.492 --> 00:09:03.921
Everyone hates that equally, but Republicans

00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:06.593
and Democrats hate that together.

00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:09.707
And so what this tells me is, when you look at

00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:13.537
the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,

00:09:13.537 --> 00:09:20.922
we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.

00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:24.203
We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.

00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:26.998
We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.

00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:31.284
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,

00:09:31.284 --> 00:09:34.766
and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:36.649
we don't care, spend some more,

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.555
and that of course is Republicans

00:09:38.555 --> 00:09:40.535
when it comes to military defense spending.

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:43.030
They way outweigh Democrats.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.825
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.046
That's 20 percent of the budget,

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:53.729
and that presents a more difficult issue.

00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:56.654
I should also note that the [discretionary] spending,

00:09:56.654 --> 00:09:58.788
which is about 19 percent of the budget,

00:09:58.788 --> 00:10:01.158
that is Democratic and Republican issues,

00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:03.526
so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs

00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:05.560
that tend to be popular among Democrats,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.525
but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.470
inducements for oil drilling and other things,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.085
which tend to be popular among Republicans.

00:10:15.085 --> 00:10:18.409
Now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.273
That's a more partisan area.

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:23.667
You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:27.716
of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,

00:10:27.716 --> 00:10:32.956
Republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,

00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:37.649
Republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:42.004
So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.

00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:45.260
Raising taxes on investment income, you also see

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.124
about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans

00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:51.923
are comfortable with that idea.

00:10:51.923 --> 00:10:54.948
This brings up a really important point, which is that

00:10:54.948 --> 00:10:57.564
we tend in this country to talk about Democrats

00:10:57.564 --> 00:10:59.375
and Republicans and think there's this little group

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:01.740
over there called independents that's, what, two percent?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.852
If you add Democrats, you add Republicans,

00:11:03.852 --> 00:11:05.346
you've got the American people.

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:08.292
But that is not the case at all.

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:13.437
And it has not been the case for most of modern American history.

00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:17.254
Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:20.103
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:24.583
A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.270
or some other small third party,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.477
and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.

00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:35.398
So most Americans are not partisan,

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:37.566
and most of the people in the independent camp

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:41.257
fall somewhere in between, so even though we have

00:11:41.257 --> 00:11:44.817
tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues

00:11:44.817 --> 00:11:47.113
of Democrats and Republicans,

00:11:47.113 --> 00:11:50.905
we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.

00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:54.145
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.

00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:56.258
We get to hate each other on gun control

00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:58.538
and abortion and the environment,

00:11:58.538 --> 00:12:01.410
but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.242
we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:07.274
And in fact, there's this other group of people

00:12:07.274 --> 00:12:10.612
who are not as divided as people might think,

00:12:10.612 --> 00:12:12.625
and that group is economists.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:17.928
I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s

00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:21.026
and '80s it was ugly being an economist.

00:12:21.026 --> 00:12:24.201
You were in what they called the saltwater camp,

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:28.815
meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:31.783
or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,

00:12:31.783 --> 00:12:33.235
University of Rochester.

00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:36.231
You were a free market capitalist economist

00:12:36.231 --> 00:12:38.364
or you were a Keynesian liberal economist,

00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:40.539
and these people didn't go to each other's weddings,

00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:42.431
they snubbed each other at conferences.

00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:45.440
It's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.041
it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:53.065
who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:56.017
The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool

00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:58.858
to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.

00:12:58.858 --> 00:13:01.379
The phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:03.906
or a postdoc or you're a professor,

00:13:03.906 --> 00:13:06.883
a 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.

00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:08.427
I go by the data."

00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:10.831
And the data is very clear.

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.852
None of these major theories have been completely successful.

00:13:14.852 --> 00:13:16.500
The 20th century, the last hundred years,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.451
is riddled with disastrous examples

00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:23.123
of times that one school or the other tried to explain

00:13:23.123 --> 00:13:25.443
the past or predict the future

00:13:25.443 --> 00:13:27.329
and just did an awful, awful job,

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:32.518
so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.

00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:36.112
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,

00:13:36.112 --> 00:13:38.989
but they're now arrogant about their impartiality,

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:45.780
and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.880
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.619
that has existed in secret

00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:54.335
in America for years and years and years.

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:58.299
I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:02.195
organizations that survey American political attitudes:

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:03.749
Pew Research,

00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:07.397
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,

00:14:07.397 --> 00:14:10.245
and the most important but the least known

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:13.220
is the American National Election Studies group

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.566
that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.

00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:19.528
They've been doing it since 1948,

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:23.015
and what they show consistently throughout

00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:27.462
is that it's almost impossible to find Americans

00:14:27.462 --> 00:14:30.623
who are consistent ideologically,

00:14:30.623 --> 00:14:34.359
who consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.039
and we must limit the size of government,"

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.739
or, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role

00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:44.735
in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:46.613
Those groups are very, very small.

00:14:46.613 --> 00:14:49.609
The vast majority of people, they pick and choose,

00:14:49.609 --> 00:14:52.173
they see compromise and they change over time

00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:54.706
when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.

00:14:54.706 --> 00:14:58.067
And that part of it has not changed.

00:14:58.067 --> 00:15:02.020
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.618
If you ask people vague questions, like,

00:15:04.618 --> 00:15:07.610
"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.924
"Do you think government should" — especially if you use loaded language --

00:15:11.924 --> 00:15:14.403
"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"

00:15:14.403 --> 00:15:16.332
Or, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.933
Then you can see radical partisan change.

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.627
But when you get specific, when you actually ask

00:15:21.627 --> 00:15:25.667
about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:28.275
people are remarkably centrist,

00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:31.140
they're remarkably open to compromise.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.925
So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,

00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:39.451
don't think of it as the American people fundamentally

00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:41.627
can't stand each other on these issues

00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:43.182
and that we must be ripped apart

00:15:43.182 --> 00:15:45.504
into two separate warring nations.

00:15:45.504 --> 00:15:51.430
Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.276
and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:57.852
And they've captured the process through familiar ways,

00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.804
through a primary system which encourages

00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:03.036
that small group of people's voices,

00:16:03.036 --> 00:16:05.141
because that small group of people,

00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:08.213
the people who answer all yeses or all noes

00:16:08.213 --> 00:16:10.620
on those ideological questions,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.227
they might be small but every one of them has a blog,

00:16:13.227 --> 00:16:16.981
every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.

00:16:16.981 --> 00:16:20.134
Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,

00:16:20.134 --> 00:16:22.266
but they don't represent us.

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:25.367
They don't represent what our views are.

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:27.173
And that gets me back to the dollar,

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:30.398
and it gets me back to reminding myself that

00:16:30.398 --> 00:16:32.408
we know this experience.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.053
We know what it's like

00:16:34.053 --> 00:16:39.408
to have these people on TV, in Congress,

00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:42.135
yelling about how the end of the world is coming

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:45.361
if we don't adopt their view completely,

00:16:45.361 --> 00:16:47.355
because it's happened about the dollar

00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:49.358
ever since there's been a dollar.

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:53.252
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.

00:16:53.252 --> 00:16:57.922
In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,

00:16:57.922 --> 00:17:01.796
when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments

00:17:01.796 --> 00:17:03.668
over how it would be constituted,

00:17:03.668 --> 00:17:05.445
and a general agreement that the way it was constituted

00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:08.352
was the worst possible compromise,

00:17:08.352 --> 00:17:11.712
a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,

00:17:11.712 --> 00:17:14.069
this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.580
so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.630
The Fed can't mess it up so badly.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.767
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals

00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:25.181
during the Depression and we got off the gold standard

00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:29.279
as a source of international currency coordination

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.511
during Richard Nixon's presidency.

00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:35.484
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.

00:17:35.484 --> 00:17:37.638
And nothing happened at all.

00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:39.576
Throughout it all, the dollar has been

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:41.884
one of the most long-standing,

00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:44.019
stable, reasonable currencies,

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.186
and we all use it every single day,

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:49.211
no matter what the people screaming about tell us,

00:17:49.211 --> 00:17:52.255
no matter how scared we're supposed to be.

00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:56.200
And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.129
I think what is most maddening about it is,

00:18:00.129 --> 00:18:04.068
if Congress were simply able

00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:06.441
to show not that they agree with each other,

00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:09.721
not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.803
but that they are able to just begin the process

00:18:12.803 --> 00:18:17.284
towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.

00:18:17.284 --> 00:18:21.418
The fear is that the world is watching.

00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:24.875
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution,

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.663
the more the world will look to the U.S.

00:18:26.663 --> 00:18:30.283
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,

00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:33.858
but as a place that can't resolve its own fights,

00:18:33.858 --> 00:18:37.684
and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,

00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:39.467
the higher interest rates are going to be,

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:42.171
the quicker we're going to have to face a day

00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:44.278
of horrible calamity.

00:18:44.278 --> 00:18:47.842
And so just the act of compromise itself,

00:18:47.842 --> 00:18:49.743
and sustained, real compromise,

00:18:49.743 --> 00:18:51.557
would give us even more time,

00:18:51.557 --> 00:18:54.519
would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:57.154
and reach even more compromise down the road.

00:18:57.154 --> 00:19:00.266
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:04.559
is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:08.671
to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms

00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.232
that do polarize us,

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.841
but to just talk about it like what it is,

00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:14.784
not an existential crisis,

00:19:14.784 --> 00:19:19.757
not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,

00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:22.359
but a math problem, a really solvable math problem,

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:24.435
one where we're not all going to get what we want

00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:28.390
and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.905
But the more we address it as a practical concern,

00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:33.416
the sooner we can resolve it,

00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:36.883
and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.

00:19:36.883 --> 00:19:41.867
Thank you. (Applause)
