00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
So it was about four years ago, five years ago,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
with a bag similar to this.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
but your body knows it extremely well.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Actually our body doesn't hate these.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Our body loves these. It eats them.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
on the cell, it means "that's food."

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
immune response to this ridiculous molecule

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
But I said we can't get rid of it,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
found out you can't get rid of that immunity.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
And I said, why don't you use that?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
What if I could stick this molecule,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
slap it onto a bacteria

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
I mean I could immediately tap into

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
an immune response that was already there,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it --

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
and then charges you for possession of marijuana.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
(Laughter)

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
So you can take a bacteria

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
that really doesn't make these things at all,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
and if you could clamp these on it really well

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
you have it taken off the street.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And for certain bacteria

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
Our antibiotics are running out.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now --

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant --

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
because we won't be here. But if we are --

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
(Laughter)

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.330
So I started working with this thing,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
with a bunch of collaborators.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
And trying to attach this to things that were

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
themselves attached to certain specific target zones,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
bacteria that we don't like.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
And I feel now like George Bush.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
It's like "mission accomplished."

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.330
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.330
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
sort of symbolizing this right now.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
to a target that you have selected for it.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and will alert your immune system to go after it.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
Here's what happened. See that line on the very top

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
with the little dots?

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
by our scientist friends down in Texas,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
that would attack anthrax in particular,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
and direct your immune system to it.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line --

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
that's a 100 percent survival rate.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
And they actually lived another 14 days,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
or 28 when we finally killed them,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
Why did they not die?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
So we did it. Okay?

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
(Applause)

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Mission accomplished!

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:28.330
(Applause)
