00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
It's a great honor today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
to share with you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
The Digital Universe,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
which was created for humanity

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
to really see where we are

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
in the universe.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
[The Himalayas.]

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(Music)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
The flat horizon that we've evolved with

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
has been a metaphor for the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
infinite: unbounded resources

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and unlimited capacity

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
for disposal of waste.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
It wasn't until we really

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
left Earth,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
got above the atmosphere

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and had seen the horizon

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
bend back on itself,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that we could understand our planet

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
as a limited condition.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
The Digital Universe Atlas

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
has been built

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
at the American Museum of Natural History

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
over the past 12 years.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
We maintain that,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
put that together

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
as a project

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
to really chart the universe

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
across all scales.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
What we see here are satellites around the Earth

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and the Earth in proper registration

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
against the universe, as we see.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
NASA supported this work

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
12 years ago

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
as part of the rebuilding

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
of the Hayden Planetarium

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
so that we would share this with the world.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The Digital Universe is the basis

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
of our space show productions that we do --

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
our main space shows in the dome.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
But what you see here

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
is the result of, actually, internships

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
that we hosted with Linkoping University

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
in Sweden.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I've had 12 students work on this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
for their graduate work,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and the result has been this software called Uniview

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and a company called SCISS in Sweden.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This software

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
allows interactive use,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
so this actual flight path

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and movie that we see here

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
was actually flown live.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I captured this live from my laptop

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
in a cafe called Earth Matters

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and it was done

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
as a collaborative project

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
for an exhibit

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
on comparative cosmology.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And so as we move out,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
we see continuously from our planet

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
As we move out,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
the light from these distant galaxies

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
have taken so long,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
we're essentially backing up into the past.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
We back so far up

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
we're finally seeing a containment around us --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
This is the WMAP

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
microwave background

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that we see.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
If we were outside this,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But this our containment of the visible universe.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Coming back quickly,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
but these are positions,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
the latest positions of exoplanets

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that we've mapped,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
between several orders of magnitude

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to get down to where we see the solar system --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
these are the paths of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Coming in closer,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
picking up Earth,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
This map can be updated,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and we can add in new data.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
for the Cassini mission.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
But here we see the complex trajectory

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
of the Cassini mission

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
color coded for different mission phases,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
ingeniously developed so that

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
which is larger that the planet Mercury,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This software allows us to come close

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and look at parts of this.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
This software can also be networked between domes.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
We have a growing user base of this,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and we network domes.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And we can network between domes and classrooms.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
We're actually sharing tours of the universe

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
with the first sub-Saharan

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
planetarium in Ghana

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
as well as

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
new libraries that have been built

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
in the ghettos in Columbia

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and a high school

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
in Cambodia.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And the Cambodians have

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
This is an image from Saturday,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
This is Nepal.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
right here in Tibet.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
But we can see the haze

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
down below in India.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
This is Nepal and Tibet.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And just in closing,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
here we see a bit of the snow

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
so I'd like to just say

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
that what the world needs now

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
is a sense of being able to

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
look at ourselves in this much larger condition now

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and a much larger sense of what home is.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Because our home is the universe,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and we are the universe, essentially.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
We carry that in us.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And to be able to see our context

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
in this larger sense at all scales

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
helps us all, I think, in understanding

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
where we are and who we are in the universe.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Thank you.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
(Applause)
