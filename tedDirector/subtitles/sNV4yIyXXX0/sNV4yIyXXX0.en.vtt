00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:18.516
I've been a journalist now since I was about 17,

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:22.076
and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:24.412
because as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:26.892
going on in media, and most of you probably know this

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:30.115
from the business angle, which is that the business model

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:33.058
is pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:35.772
the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:38.116
So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:41.200
but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.295
It's on the input side. It's concern with

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:46.793
how we get information and how we gather the news.

00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:49.864
And that's changed, because we've had a huge shift

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.102
in the balance of power from

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:54.119
the news organizations to the audience.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.334
And the audience for such a long time was in a position

00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:59.024
where they didn't have any way of affecting news

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.291
or making any change. They couldn't really connect.

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.767
And that's changed irrevocably.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.656
My first connection with the news media was

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:09.467
in 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.755
I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons.

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:15.302
So I wrote a letter.

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:18.151
And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail:

00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:21.238
"Love Markham, Aged 4." Still works.

00:01:21.238 --> 00:01:24.249
I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.931
but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:29.091
And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.284
to have any impact and get some feedback.

00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:33.766
And that's changed now because, as journalists,

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.932
we interact in real time. We're not in a position

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:39.266
where the audience is reacting to news.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.023
We're reacting to the audience, and we're actually relying on them.

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:45.409
They're helping us find the news. They're helping us

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.179
figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.083
So it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening

00:01:54.083 --> 00:02:00.000
on a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.633
To give an example of how we rely on the audience,

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:07.170
on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.496
It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.376
And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:14.941
for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:19.086
So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:21.742
Thirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.603
and this was someone saying "temblor," which means earthquake.

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:26.940
So 60 seconds was how long it took

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.846
for the physical earthquake to travel.

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:31.406
Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:34.380
all around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.577
hypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquake

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:39.991
was happening in Managua.

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:42.342
And that happened because this one person had

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:46.291
a documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.823
which is what we all do now, so if something happens,

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:50.905
we put our status update, or we post a photo,

00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:54.683
we post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:57.444
And what that means is just constant,

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.850
huge volumes of data going up.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.131
It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:05.122
every minute there are 72 more hours

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:06.504
of video on YouTube.

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:09.786
So that's, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:14.042
And in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:17.798
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:21.506
So by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:25.124
more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:28.987
and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:32.919
So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist,

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.335
because we should have access to everything.

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:38.233
Any event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about it

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.164
pretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:45.329
And that goes for every single person in this room.

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.939
The only problem is, when you have that much information,

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.226
you have to find the good stuff, and that can be

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:52.214
incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes.

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:54.533
And nowhere was this brought home more than during

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.437
Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.464
a superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time,

00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:03.607
hitting the iPhone capital of the universe -- (Laughter) --

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:07.822
and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before.

00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:10.566
And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.482
so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.730
We had to deal with composite images

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.913
that were merging photos from previous storms.

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:24.147
We had to deal with images from films like "The Day After Tomorrow." (Laughter)

00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:26.981
And we had to deal with images that were so realistic

00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.351
it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.

00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.664
(Laughter)

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:37.388
But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:39.664
which was subjected to a grilling by journalists.

00:04:39.664 --> 00:04:41.897
They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.420
The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.713
And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C

00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:48.873
in downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.

00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:50.973
And the reason that they could tell that it was real

00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:53.062
was because they could get to the source, and in this case,

00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:55.169
these guys were New York food bloggers.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.199
They were well respected. They were known.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.291
So this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:03.209
And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.920
And you were, instead of going and finding the information

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.487
and bringing it back to the reader, you were holding back

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:10.547
the stuff that was potentially damaging.

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:13.505
And finding the source becomes more and more important --

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:17.239
finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go.

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:20.392
It's like the de facto real-time newswire,

00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:23.359
if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.744
And a good example of how useful it can be

00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:29.277
but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

00:05:29.277 --> 00:05:31.923
As a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking

00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:34.224
from the outside, from Dublin,

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:36.016
Twitter lists, and lists of good sources,

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:39.638
people we could establish were credible, were really important.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.147
And how do you build a list like that from scratch?

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.577
Well, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:47.435
This visualization was done by an Italian academic.

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:50.829
He's called AndrÃ© Pannison, and he basically

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.004
took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:56.458
on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:59.090
and the dots you can see are retweets, so when someone

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.869
retweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.479
and the more times that message is retweeted by other people,

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.685
the more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.

00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:09.607
And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,

00:06:09.607 --> 00:06:12.318
but what you get is hints at who is more interesting

00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:14.999
and who is worth investigating.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.878
And as the conversation grew and grew, it became

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.162
more and more lively, and eventually you were left

00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:24.943
with this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.

00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:26.752
You could find the nodes, though, and then you went,

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:29.046
and you go, "Right, I've got to investigate these people.

00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:30.760
These are the ones that are obviously making sense.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.069
Let's see who they are."

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.759
Now in the deluge of information, this is where

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.966
the real-time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself,

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.940
because we have more tools than ever

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.697
to do that kind of investigation.

00:06:43.697 --> 00:06:46.706
And when you start digging into the sources, you can go

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.005
further and further than you ever could before.

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:52.357
Sometimes you come across a piece of content that

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:55.817
is so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it,

00:06:55.817 --> 00:06:58.492
but you're not 100 percent sure if you can because

00:06:58.492 --> 00:06:59.699
you don't know if the source is credible.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.881
You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload.

00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:03.590
And you have to do that investigative work.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.934
And this video, which I'm going to let run through,

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:08.923
was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:11.122
Video: Getting real windy in just a second.

00:07:11.122 --> 00:07:16.010
(Rain and wind sounds)

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.177
(Explosion) Oh, shit!

00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:22.114
Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something

00:07:22.114 --> 00:07:24.666
you'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:26.929
You know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.499
very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden.

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.993
But how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked,

00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:35.651
or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted?

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.877
So we set about going to work on this video, and

00:07:37.877 --> 00:07:40.737
the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.

00:07:40.737 --> 00:07:43.088
There was only one video posted to that account,

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.576
and the username was Rita Krill.

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:47.868
And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:50.781
But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:54.089
The first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:56.471
So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,

00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.233
we found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.

00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:01.882
So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:04.349
called Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.846
for the day in which this video had been uploaded,

00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.729
and when we went through all those various cities,

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.225
we found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.870
So we went to the white pages, and we found,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.794
we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.366
and we looked through a couple of different addresses,

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.682
and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.

00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:24.597
And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked

00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:27.515
remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video,

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:30.486
and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:33.701
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella,

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.546
there's a white lilo in the pool,

00:08:35.546 --> 00:08:37.986
there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,

00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:40.040
and there's two trees in the background.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.467
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,

00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:45.138
and sure enough, there's the white lilo,

00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:48.132
there are the two trees,

00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:50.118
there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.

00:08:50.118 --> 00:08:53.896
Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.

00:08:53.896 --> 00:08:57.046
So we were able to call Rita, clear the video,

00:08:57.046 --> 00:08:59.132
make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients

00:08:59.132 --> 00:09:02.326
were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:04.101
Sometimes the search for truth, though,

00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:08.510
is a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.493
Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviously

00:09:11.493 --> 00:09:14.174
a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:17.973
potentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube

00:09:17.973 --> 00:09:20.330
actually becomes the most important repository

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.480
of information about what's going on in the world.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.234
So this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing,

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:29.955
because it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.

00:09:29.955 --> 00:09:32.283
This is from Hama.

00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:35.253
Video: (Shouting)

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:39.157
And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,

00:09:39.157 --> 00:09:41.918
is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:44.523
and thrown off a bridge.

00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:47.304
The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood

00:09:47.304 --> 00:09:50.179
and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:53.113
off the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,

00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:55.495
and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:57.737
and whether or not they were what the video said it was.

00:09:57.737 --> 00:10:01.003
So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been

00:10:01.003 --> 00:10:03.336
back and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:07.150
and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.064
Three different sources said three different things about the bridge.

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:12.326
They said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.

00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:15.850
Another one said the bridge does exist, but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.412
And the third one said, "I think the bridge does exist,

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:21.776
but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:25.173
so the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn't make sense."

00:10:25.173 --> 00:10:27.785
So that was the only one that gave us a clue.

00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:29.010
We looked through the video for other clues.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.099
We saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:35.843
We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:38.160
so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.116
It had black-and-white curbs.

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:42.102
As we looked at the river itself, you could see there's

00:10:42.102 --> 00:10:45.056
a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood.

00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:46.790
That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.487
south to north. That's what that tells me.

00:10:48.487 --> 00:10:50.836
And also, as you look away from the bridge,

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:52.485
there's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.915
and the river narrows.

00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:57.494
So onto Google Maps we go, and we start

00:10:57.494 --> 00:10:59.552
looking through literally every single bridge.

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:03.032
We go to the dam that we talked about, we start just

00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:06.642
literally going through every time that road crosses the river,

00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:08.380
crossing off the bridges that don't match.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.143
We're looking for one that crosses east-west.

00:11:10.143 --> 00:11:12.095
And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam

00:11:12.095 --> 00:11:14.098
to Hama and there's no bridge.

00:11:14.098 --> 00:11:16.582
So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:19.502
and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:22.540
The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.701
So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.

00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:28.603
We start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.

00:11:28.603 --> 00:11:32.249
And it's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,

00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:34.561
and as we click through it, you can see someone's

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:37.515
uploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,

00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:40.202
so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us

00:11:40.202 --> 00:11:42.824
more detail that we can cross-reference with the video.

00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:46.547
The first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:48.652
which is handy because we've seen that before.

00:11:48.652 --> 00:11:52.151
We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys

00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:54.502
throwing the bodies over.

00:11:54.502 --> 00:11:57.157
And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.

00:11:57.157 --> 00:11:58.681
So what does that tell me? I've got to go back now

00:11:58.681 --> 00:12:00.994
to my three sources and look at what they told me:

00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:02.719
the one who said the bridge didn't exist,

00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:04.578
the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama,

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:08.531
and the one guy who said, "Yes, the bridge does exist, but I'm not sure about the water levels."

00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:11.862
Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,

00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:14.843
and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools

00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:17.363
sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin

00:12:17.363 --> 00:12:18.850
in the space of 20 minutes.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.289
And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:24.554
is running like a torrent, there's so much information there

00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:27.741
that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,

00:12:27.741 --> 00:12:31.068
if you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:33.463
Given a couple of clues, I could probably find out

00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:36.997
a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.

00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:40.002
But what it tells me is that, at a time when

00:12:40.002 --> 00:12:44.031
there's more -- there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been,

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:46.664
it's harder to filter, we have greater tools.

00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:48.527
We have free Internet tools that allow us,

00:12:48.527 --> 00:12:50.753
help us do this kind of investigation.

00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:52.576
We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before,

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:54.997
and computers that are quicker than ever before.

00:12:54.997 --> 00:12:58.424
But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.

00:12:58.424 --> 00:13:00.209
They're yes or no, they're black or white.

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:03.763
Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.

00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:08.427
Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.

00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:10.534
No matter how quick we get with computers, no matter

00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:12.918
how much information we have, you'll never be able

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.914
to remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,

00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:19.572
because in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.

00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:23.572
Thanks very much. (Applause)
