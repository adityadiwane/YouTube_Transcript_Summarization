00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
How do groups get anything done? Right?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
How do you organize a group of individuals

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
so that the output of the group

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
is something coherent and of lasting value,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
instead of just being chaos?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And the economic framing of that problem

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
is called coordination costs.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
or institutional difficulties in arranging group output.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
You found something. It can be private or public.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
But you get these resources together.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
You found an institution, and you use the institution

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
to coordinate the activities of the group.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
More recently, because the cost of letting groups

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
communicate with each other has fallen through the floor --

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and communication costs are one of the big

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
to design systems that coordinate the output

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
without regard to institutional models.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
So, that's what I want to talk about today.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
but always pointing to the broader themes.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
Some people get less dressed up.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Young and old, dancing in the streets.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Colorful characters, and a good time is had by all.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
charming though it is, but rather to these photos.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I didn't take them. How did I get them?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
Flickr is a photo-sharing service

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
that allows people to take photos, upload them,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160
share them over the Web and so forth.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Delicious is a social bookmarking service.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Right? If I had given this talk last year,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
I couldn't do what I just did,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
because I couldn't have found those photos.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
But instead of saying,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
we need to hire a professional class of librarians

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
to organize these photos once they're uploaded,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Flickr simply turned over to the users

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
the ability to characterize the photos.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.160
"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
shown in reverse chronological order.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And I was then able to go and retrieve them

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
to give you that little slideshow.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
Now, what hard problem is being solved here?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And it's -- in the most schematic possible view,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
it's a coordination problem, right?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
There are a large number of people on the Internet,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
How do we get those people together to contribute that work?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
The classic answer is to form an institution, right?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160
To draw those people into some prearranged structure

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
that has explicit goals.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And I want to call your attention to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
some of the side effects of going the institutional route.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
First of all, when you form an institution,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
you take on a management problem, right?

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
No good just hiring employees,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Right? You have to have economic structure.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
You have to have legal structure.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.160
You have to have physical structure.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
And that creates additional costs.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
You can't hire everyone in a company, right?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
You have to exclude some people.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And fourth, as a result of that exclusion,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.160
you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
We've gone from people with photos to photographers.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Right? We've created a professional class of photographers

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
or whatever else they're sent out to photograph.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
which is the Flickr answer,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
you can leave the people where they are

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and you take the problem to the individuals, rather than

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
moving the individuals to the problem.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.160
You arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
you get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
You lose the institutional imperative.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
but you also shed the institutional cost,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
which gives you greater flexibility.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
whenever you bought your first mobile phone,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
and you stopped making plans.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there."

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
"Call me when you get off work." Right?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160
we must have a five-year projection

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
and let's deal with it as we go,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160
because we're now well-enough coordinated

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.160
that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And everything that was hard about the coordination cost

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
There are more pictures. There are more photographers.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.160
It's taken over a wider geographic area.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
And worst of all, that figure at the bottom,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
It's mathematically true,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
but it doesn't really talk about anything important --

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.160
because in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
What matters is this.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.160
This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.160
as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
You can see here, over at the end,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And by the time we get around here,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
And by the time you get to the middle,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
you've got hundreds of people

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
who have contributed only one photo each.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
This is called a power-law distribution.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160
It appears often in unconstrained social systems

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like --

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
this is often what you get. Right?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
is doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
relative to the person in the first position.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
to have contributed about a tenth of the photos,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
and the hundredth most prolific photographer

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
as the most prolific photographer did.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
So, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
and for the long, flat tail.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
the systems don't converge; they diverge more.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160
In bigger systems, the head gets bigger

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.160
and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
they account for three quarters of the photos taken --

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
If you go down to five percent,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.160
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
And because of this left weighting,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.160
the average is actually here, way to the left.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
And that sounds strange to our ears,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
have contributed a below-average amount.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
That sounds strange because we expect average and middle

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
to be about the same, but they're not at all.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
this is what's going on. Right?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.160
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources --

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160
this is the shape people are talking about when that happens.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:45.160
The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
The institutional model always pushes leftwards,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
treating these people as employees.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160
The institutional response is,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.160
I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
that's what I'll do.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
The cooperative infrastructure model says,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
why do you want to give up a quarter of the value?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
If your system is designed

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
so that you have to give up a quarter of the value,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
re-engineer the system.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Don't take on the cost that prevents you

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
from getting to the contributions of these people.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:30.160
So the coordination response asks not,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
how are these people as employees, but rather,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
what is their contribution like? Right?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.160
who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
Right? So the question is,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
do you want that photo? Yes or no.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.160
And the tension here is between institution as enabler

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
and institution as obstacle.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
When you're dealing with the left-hand edge

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
of one of these distributions,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
producing a lot of the material you want,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
that's an institution-as-enabler world.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
and you can get some output.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
But when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
are adding one photo at a time,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
that's institution as obstacle.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
One of the first things that happens

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
when you institutionalize a problem

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
is that the first goal of the institution

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
to self-preservation.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
and that there are other ways of coordinating the value,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.160
they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages --

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.160
(Laughter)

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
-- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.160
denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
haven't been around long enough

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
to have gotten to the acceptance phase.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Many, many institutions are still in denial,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.160
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
right, because the fact that they have coordinated

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.160
themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160
You can follow this in the Guardian.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
It's actually quite entertaining.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
The bigger question is,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
what do you do about the value down here?

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Right? How do you capture that?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
And institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
"Oh, this business of thousands of programmers

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
contributing to Linux, this is a myth.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
and most of the patches have been produced by programmers

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
who've only done one thing." Right?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
You can hear this distribution under that complaint.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
And you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.160
that's a bad idea, right?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
(Laughter)

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
Right? Bad hire. Right?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
(Laughter)

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
What if it was a security patch?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
of which Windows has not some, [but] several?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Do you want that patch, right?

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
The fact that a single programmer can,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
without having to move into a professional relation

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
to an institution, improve Linux once

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.160
and never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
systems of open-source software, of file sharing,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
but there are actually stories about this from all over.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Meetup, a service founded so that users could find people

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
in their local area who share their interests and affinities

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
or a pub or what have you.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
he thought it would be used for, you know,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
The inventors don't know what the invention is.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
Number one group on Meetup right now,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
Stay-at-home moms. Right?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
In the suburbanized, dual-income United States,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
stay-at-home moms are actually missing

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
the social infrastructure that comes from extended family

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
and local, small-scale neighborhoods.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
So they're reinventing it, using these tools.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160
Meetup is the platform,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
but the value here is in social infrastructure.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
If you want to know what technology is going to change the world,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
don't pay attention to 13-year-old boys --

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
pay attention to young mothers,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
because they have got not an ounce of support for technology

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
that doesn't materially make their lives better.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
This is so much more important than Xbox,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
but it's a lot less glitzy.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
I think this is a revolution.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
I think that this is a really profound change

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.160
in the way human affairs are arranged.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And I use that word advisedly.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.160
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.160
is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources --

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160
she's a reporter for the New York Times --

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.160
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws --

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
This is happening, however, against the background

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
of the rise of Web logging.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
It has de-professionalized publishing.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Want to publish globally anything you think today?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.160
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
That has sent the professional class of publishing down

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
into the ranks of mass amateurization.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
And so the shield law, as much as we want it --

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
we want a professional class of truth-tellers --

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
it is becoming increasingly incoherent, because

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
the institution is becoming incoherent.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
There are people in the States right now

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
tying themselves into knots, trying to figure out

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
whether or not bloggers are journalists.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
And the answer to that question is,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
Journalism was an answer to an even more important question,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
which is, how will society be informed?

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
How will they share ideas and opinions?

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
the professional framework of journalism,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.160
it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160
and apply it to this distributed class.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
So as much as we want the shield laws,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
the background -- the institution to which they were attached --

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
is becoming incoherent.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
Here's another example.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
These are groups of teenage girls

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
other kinds of cooperative infrastructure,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
and have used it to set up support groups for

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160
remaining anorexic by choice.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
They have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
They even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
these red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.160
I am trying to maintain my eating disorder.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.160
They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
We're used to support groups being beneficial.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.160
But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.160
A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
a way of living in the context of a larger group.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
that's a great support group.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
But when the small group is teenage girls

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.160
who want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
What's happened is that the normative goals

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
of the support groups that we're used to,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.160
came from the institutions that were framing them,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160
and not from the infrastructure.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.160
Once the infrastructure becomes generically available,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
the logic of the support group has been revealed to be

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.160
accessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
So, there are significant downsides to these changes

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.160
as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.160
one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.160
who perpetrated the 9/11 attack.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.160
are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell you

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
what's going to come as a result of all of this,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
but I'm running out of time, which is good,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
because I don't know.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
(Laughter)

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.160
Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.160
It takes us from Point A to chaos.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.160
The printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
moving from a world where the Catholic Church

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.160
was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160
when we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.160
Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.160
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.160
are going to be given increasingly high leverage,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.160
and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives --

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
like deciding in advance what's going to happen,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
And institutions are going to come under

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.160
an increasing degree of pressure,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.160
on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
And that's going to happen one arena at a time,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
one institution at a time. The forces are general,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
but the results are going to be specific.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
And so the point here is not,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.160
"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.160
from only institutions to only cooperative framework."

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
It's going to be much more complicated than that.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.160
But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.160
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.160
my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.160
Thank you very much.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
(Applause)
