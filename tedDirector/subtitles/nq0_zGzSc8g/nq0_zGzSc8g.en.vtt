00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:16.053
There is an ancient proverb that says

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:20.115
it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:22.903
especially when there is no cat.

00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:26.232
I find this a particularly apt description of science

00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:28.368
and how science works --

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:31.688
bumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,

00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:33.990
trying to figure out what shape this might be,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.434
what that might be,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.923
there are reports of a cat somewhere around,

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:39.716
they may not be reliable, they may be,

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:41.236
and so forth and so on.

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:43.212
Now I know this is different than the way most people

00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:44.764
think about science.

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:46.318
Science, we generally are told,

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:49.068
is a very well-ordered mechanism for

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:50.369
understanding the world,

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.655
for gaining facts, for gaining data,

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.208
that it's rule-based,

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.449
that scientists use this thing called the scientific method

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.288
and we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now,

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:02.859
and the scientific method is a set of rules

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.051
for getting hard, cold facts out of the data.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.146
I'd like to tell you that's not the case.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.978
So there's the scientific method,

00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:13.297
but what's really going on is this. (Laughter)

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:14.255
[The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around]

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:17.359
And it's going on kind of like that.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.780
[... in the dark] (Laughter)

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.321
So what is the difference, then,

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:27.137
between the way I believe science is pursued

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.998
and the way it seems to be perceived?

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:32.713
So this difference first came to me in some ways

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:34.810
in my dual role at Columbia University,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.965
where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.160
where we try to figure out how the brain works.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.531
We do this by studying the sense of smell,

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:46.062
the sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory,

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.696
it's a great pleasure and fascinating work

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.567
and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:54.178
and think up cool experiments to understand how this

00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:56.564
sense of smell works and how the brain might be working,

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:59.366
and, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.084
But at the same time, it's my responsibility

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:05.033
to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.108
and that's a big subject,

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:08.499
and it takes quite a while to organize that,

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.310
and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.867
but I have to say, it's not so exhilarating.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.263
So what was the difference?

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:18.332
Well, the course I was and am teaching

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:24.796
is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. (Laughs)

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:29.351
It's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts,

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:33.668
it uses this giant book called "Principles of Neural Science"

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:36.002
by three famous neuroscientists.

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.783
This book comes in at 1,414 pages,

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.519
it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.446
Just to put that in some perspective,

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.901
that's the weight of two normal human brains.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.184
(Laughter)

00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:54.451
So I began to realize, by the end of this course,

00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:56.699
that the students maybe were getting the idea

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.730
that we must know everything there is to know about the brain.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.492
That's clearly not true.

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:04.190
And they must also have this idea, I suppose,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.571
that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.660
and stick them in these big books.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.067
And that's not really the case either.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.370
When I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.467
and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues,

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:19.668
we never talk about what we know.

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.834
We talk about what we don't know.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.119
We talk about what still has to get done,

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.944
what's so critical to get done in the lab.

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:29.501
Indeed, this was, I think, best said by Marie Curie

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.920
who said that one never notices what has been done

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.381
but only what remains to be done.

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:35.606
This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining

00:03:35.606 --> 00:03:39.324
her second graduate degree, I should say.

00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:42.137
I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie,

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.440
because I am convinced that that glow behind her

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.178
is not a photographic effect. (Laughter)

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:48.978
That's the real thing.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:53.358
It is true that her papers are, to this day,

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.237
stored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:58.434
in a concrete room that's lead-lined,

00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:01.086
and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks,

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:03.835
you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit,

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:06.186
so it's pretty scary business.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:08.982
Nonetheless, this is what I think we were leaving out

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.608
of our courses

00:04:10.608 --> 00:04:13.134
and leaving out of the interaction that we have

00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:16.107
with the public as scientists, the what-remains-to-be-done.

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:18.741
This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting.

00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:21.651
It is, if you will, the ignorance.

00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:22.630
That's what was missing.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.490
So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.590
on ignorance,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.219
something I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.097
So I did start teaching this course on ignorance,

00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:34.193
and it's been quite interesting

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.279
and I'd like to tell you to go to the website.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.915
You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.438
And it's been really quite an interesting time for me

00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:45.279
to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.827
about what it is they don't know.

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.812
Now I use this word "ignorance," of course,

00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:51.970
to be at least in part intentionally provocative,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.360
because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.365
and I clearly don't mean any of those.

00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:59.870
So I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.178
to fact or reason or data.

00:05:02.178 --> 00:05:05.449
The ignorant are clearly unenlightened, unaware,

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.756
uninformed, and present company today excepted,

00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:11.664
often occupy elected offices, it seems to me.

00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:13.470
That's another story, perhaps.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.103
I mean a different kind of ignorance.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:17.371
I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative,

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:20.858
a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge,

00:05:20.858 --> 00:05:22.723
something that's just not there to be known

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:25.544
or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from,

00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:27.862
the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:29.707
in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell,

00:05:29.707 --> 00:05:33.156
perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein,

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:35.457
who said, "Thoroughly conscious ignorance

00:05:35.457 --> 00:05:38.025
is the prelude to every real advance in science."

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.413
I think it's a wonderful idea:

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:42.560
thoroughly conscious ignorance.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.981
So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today,

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.500
but of course the first thing we have to clear up

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.603
is what are we going to do with all those facts?

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:52.277
So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate.

00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:55.087
We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts,

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:59.123
this accumulation model of science, as many have called it,

00:05:59.123 --> 00:06:01.574
and it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:02.888
How can you ever know all of this?

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:06.469
And indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate.

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.123
In 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published.

00:06:10.123 --> 00:06:12.755
There's about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate,

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:17.145
and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published.

00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:19.375
Divide that by the number of minutes in a year,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.513
and you wind up with three new papers per minute.

00:06:22.513 --> 00:06:23.995
So I've been up here a little over 10 minutes,

00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:25.771
I've already lost three papers.

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:28.611
I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read.

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:32.057
So what do we do about this? Well, the fact is

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:36.566
that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:39.230
We just don't worry about it, in a way.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.473
The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:43.283
to be a scientist. That's true.

00:06:43.283 --> 00:06:46.210
But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.875
You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.767
or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:56.377
But in science, knowing a lot of stuff is not the point.

00:06:56.377 --> 00:06:59.933
Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.321
to more ignorance.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.831
So knowledge is a big subject, but I would say

00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:06.318
ignorance is a bigger one.

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.512
So this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:11.411
about, some of the models of science that we tend to use,

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:13.236
and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:15.549
So one of them, a popular one, is that scientists

00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:18.177
are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together

00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:20.950
to reveal some grand scheme or another.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.508
This is clearly not true. For one, with puzzles,

00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:27.007
the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution.

00:07:27.007 --> 00:07:28.756
We don't have any such guarantee.

00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:31.911
Indeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer.

00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.974
(Laughter)

00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:36.731
So I think the puzzle model doesn't work.

00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:40.245
Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:42.441
the way you unravel the peels of an onion.

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.430
So peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.749
to get at some fundamental kernel of truth.

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:49.936
I don't think that's the way it works either.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.870
Another one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.330
that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.515
is where most of the iceberg is hidden.

00:07:57.515 --> 00:08:01.069
But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:03.489
that we can somehow or another get completed.

00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:06.832
We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is,

00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:09.437
or we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days,

00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:12.664
but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right?

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:15.131
Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case.

00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:17.530
I think what really happens in science

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.360
is a model more like the magic well,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.197
where no matter how many buckets you take out,

00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:23.309
there's always another bucket of water to be had,

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.436
or my particularly favorite one,

00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:28.375
with the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:31.502
So if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond,

00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:34.884
the important thing to realize is that our ignorance,

00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:38.266
the circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.

00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:41.029
So the knowledge generates ignorance.

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:43.944
This is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw.

00:08:43.944 --> 00:08:46.621
This is actually part of a toast that he delivered

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:50.298
to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work,

00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:51.712
in which he claims that science

00:08:51.712 --> 00:08:53.977
just creates more questions than it answers.
["Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more."]

00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:57.519
I find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.045
plus it's a kind of job security.

00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:02.771
As it turns out, he kind of cribbed that

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:04.623
from the philosopher Immanuel Kant

00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:07.268
who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea

00:09:07.268 --> 00:09:11.076
of question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.

00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:13.275
I love that term, "question propagation,"

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:16.014
this idea of questions propagating out there.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.901
So I'd say the model we want to take is not

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:21.410
that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.553
and then we gain knowledge.

00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:25.932
It's rather kind of the other way around, really.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.839
What do we use this knowledge for?

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.367
What are we using this collection of facts for?

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:33.224
We're using it to make better ignorance,

00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:36.303
to come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.

00:09:36.303 --> 00:09:38.175
Because, you know, there's low-quality ignorance

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:40.588
and there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same.

00:09:40.588 --> 00:09:42.958
Scientists argue about this all the time.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.923
Sometimes we call them bull sessions.

00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:46.841
Sometimes we call them grant proposals.

00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:50.349
But nonetheless, it's what the argument is about.

00:09:50.349 --> 00:09:52.193
It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know.

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.883
It's what makes a good question.

00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:56.513
So how do we think about these questions?

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.465
I'm going to show you a graph that shows up

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:02.332
quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments.

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:06.553
This graph asks the relationship between what you know

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.743
and how much you know about it.

00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:12.258
So what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course,

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:13.941
and how much you know about it can be anywhere

00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.364
from a little to a lot.

00:10:16.364 --> 00:10:20.596
So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.960
Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.651
They're interested in almost everything.

00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:28.105
Now you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education,

00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:29.456
and you see they know a bit more,

00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:31.346
but it's been narrowed somewhat.

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:34.065
And finally you get your Ph.D., where it turns out

00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:39.170
you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing. (Laughter)

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.951
What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that

00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:46.726
because, of course, when it dips below the zero axis, there,

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.988
it gets into a negative area.

00:10:48.988 --> 00:10:51.903
That's where you find people like me, I'm afraid.

00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:55.271
So the important thing here is that this can all be changed.

00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:57.075
This whole view can be changed

00:10:57.075 --> 00:11:00.236
by just changing the label on the x-axis.

00:11:00.236 --> 00:11:02.153
So instead of how much you know about it,

00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:05.694
we could say, "What can you ask about it?"

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:08.561
So yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist,

00:11:08.561 --> 00:11:11.190
but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.777
is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right?

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:15.915
Knowing a lot of stuff, the purpose is

00:11:15.915 --> 00:11:17.591
to be able to ask lots of questions,

00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:20.679
to be able to frame thoughtful, interesting questions,

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.404
because that's where the real work is.

00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:24.956
Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions.

00:11:24.956 --> 00:11:27.119
I'm a neuroscientist, so how would we come up

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.550
with a question in neuroscience?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.219
Because it's not always quite so straightforward.

00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:33.778
So, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does?

00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:35.592
Well, one thing the brain does, it moves us around.

00:11:35.592 --> 00:11:37.597
We walk around on two legs.

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.448
That seems kind of simple, somehow or another.

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.173
I mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age

00:11:42.173 --> 00:11:44.345
walks around on two legs, right?

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:45.736
So that maybe is not that interesting.

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:48.884
So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.

00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:51.659
How about the visual system?

00:11:51.659 --> 00:11:53.286
There it is, the visual system.

00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:56.534
I mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff.

00:11:56.534 --> 00:11:59.925
Indeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:01.505
who work on the visual system,

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:03.586
from the retina to the visual cortex,

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:06.151
in an attempt to understand not just the visual system

00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:09.175
but to also understand how general principles

00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:11.126
of how the brain might work.

00:12:11.126 --> 00:12:12.786
But now here's the thing:

00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:15.266
Our technology has actually been pretty good

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:17.856
at replicating what the visual system does.

00:12:17.856 --> 00:12:20.879
We have TV, we have movies,

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:23.374
we have animation, we have photography,

00:12:23.374 --> 00:12:26.525
we have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:29.171
They work differently than our visual systems in some cases,

00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:30.762
but nonetheless we've been pretty good at

00:12:30.762 --> 00:12:34.238
making a technology work like our visual system.

00:12:34.238 --> 00:12:37.174
Somehow or another, a hundred years of robotics,

00:12:37.174 --> 00:12:39.440
you never saw a robot walk on two legs,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.603
because robots don't walk on two legs

00:12:41.603 --> 00:12:43.993
because it's not such an easy thing to do.

00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:45.521
A hundred years of robotics,

00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:48.888
and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other.

00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:51.460
You ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.464
Turn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem.

00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:57.011
So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?

00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:58.634
What ought we to be studying?

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.929
Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs, or the motor system.

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:04.664
I'll give you an example from my own lab,

00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:06.389
my own particularly smelly question,

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.488
since we work on the sense of smell.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:11.716
But here's a diagram of five molecules

00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:13.226
and sort of a chemical notation.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:16.222
These are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules

00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:18.692
up these two little holes in the front of your face,

00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:22.566
you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.

00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:24.724
If there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones,

00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:26.284
but even if there's no rose there,

00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:27.875
you'll have the memory of a molecule.

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:30.979
How do we turn molecules into perceptions?

00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:32.836
What's the process by which that could happen?

00:13:32.836 --> 00:13:36.796
Here's another example: two very simple molecules, again in this kind of chemical notation.

00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:38.873
It might be easier to visualize them this way,

00:13:38.873 --> 00:13:41.667
so the gray circles are carbon atoms, the white ones

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:44.442
are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms.

00:13:44.442 --> 00:13:48.740
Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.428
and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it,

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:53.414
and yet one of them, heptyl acetate,

00:13:53.414 --> 00:13:55.725
has the distinct odor of a pear,

00:13:55.725 --> 00:13:59.564
and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana.

00:13:59.564 --> 00:14:02.121
So there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.

00:14:02.121 --> 00:14:05.336
One is, how can a simple little molecule like that

00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:07.804
create a perception in your brain that's so clear

00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:09.546
as a pear or a banana?

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:12.667
And secondly, how the hell can we tell the difference

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:16.982
between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom?

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.628
I mean, that's remarkable to me,

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:21.660
clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.436
And you don't even think about it, do you?

00:14:24.436 --> 00:14:27.053
So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us

00:14:27.053 --> 00:14:28.799
back to the ignorance and the idea of questions.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:30.818
I like to quote because I think dead people

00:14:30.818 --> 00:14:33.361
shouldn't be excluded from the conversation.

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:35.300
And I also think it's important to realize that

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.762
the conversation's been going on for a while, by the way.

00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:40.520
So Erwin Schrodinger, a great quantum physicist

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.086
and, I think, philosopher, points out how you have to

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:46.551
"abide by ignorance for an indefinite period" of time.

00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.538
And it's this abiding by ignorance

00:14:48.538 --> 00:14:50.204
that I think we have to learn how to do.

00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:53.181
This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business.

00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:55.140
I guess it comes down to our education system,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.597
so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education,

00:14:57.597 --> 00:14:59.865
because I think that's where it really has to play out.

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:02.132
So for one, let's face it,

00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:05.484
in the age of Google and Wikipedia,

00:15:05.484 --> 00:15:07.277
the business model of the university

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:10.698
and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change.

00:15:10.698 --> 00:15:12.599
We just can't sell facts for a living anymore.

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.649
They're available with a click of the mouse,

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:17.145
or if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:18.857
one of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things

00:15:18.857 --> 00:15:20.274
that tell us all this stuff.

00:15:20.274 --> 00:15:23.157
So what do we have to do? We have to give our students

00:15:23.157 --> 00:15:27.053
a taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference,

00:15:27.053 --> 00:15:31.361
for what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:33.518
How do we do that?

00:15:33.518 --> 00:15:35.026
Well, one of the problems, of course,

00:15:35.026 --> 00:15:37.135
turns out to be testing.

00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:39.784
We currently have an educational system

00:15:39.784 --> 00:15:43.493
which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.

00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:46.467
So in second grade, all the kids are interested in science,

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:47.730
the girls and the boys.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.704
They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity.

00:15:51.704 --> 00:15:54.203
They like to investigate things. They go to science museums.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:16:00.391
They like to play around. They're in second grade.

00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:01.901
They're interested.

00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:04.835
But by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent

00:16:04.835 --> 00:16:07.910
of them have any interest in science whatsoever,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.855
let alone a desire to go into science as a career.

00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:13.837
So we have this remarkably efficient system

00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:17.810
for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.724
Is this what we want?

00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:22.066
I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine

00:16:22.066 --> 00:16:24.788
calls "the bulimic method of education."

00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:26.161
You know. You can imagine what it is.

00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.109
We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here

00:16:29.109 --> 00:16:31.463
and then they puke it up on an exam over here

00:16:31.463 --> 00:16:36.042
and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever.

00:16:36.042 --> 00:16:38.123
This can't possibly continue to go on.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.457
So what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say,

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.440
have an interesting maxim they live by.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.692
Geneticists always say, you always get what you screen for.

00:16:47.692 --> 00:16:50.553
And that's meant as a warning.

00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:52.872
So we always will get what we screen for,

00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:56.327
and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods.

00:16:56.327 --> 00:16:59.570
Well, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation,

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.757
and we have to think carefully when we're testing

00:17:01.757 --> 00:17:04.844
whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding,

00:17:04.844 --> 00:17:06.303
whether we're weeding people out,

00:17:06.303 --> 00:17:09.437
whether we're making some cut.

00:17:09.437 --> 00:17:12.078
Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation

00:17:12.078 --> 00:17:14.988
in the literature these days, in the educational literature,

00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:17.946
but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts

00:17:17.946 --> 00:17:20.100
to an opportunity for trial and error.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.594
It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time

00:17:24.594 --> 00:17:26.504
with this kind of feedback.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:29.442
That's different than weeding, and usually, I have to tell you,

00:17:29.442 --> 00:17:32.168
when people talk about evaluation, evaluating students,

00:17:32.168 --> 00:17:34.955
evaluating teachers, evaluating schools,

00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:39.116
evaluating programs, that they're really talking about weeding.

00:17:39.116 --> 00:17:43.326
And that's a bad thing, because then you will get what you select for,

00:17:43.326 --> 00:17:45.284
which is what we've gotten so far.

00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:48.725
So I'd say what we need is a test that says, "What is x?"

00:17:48.725 --> 00:17:51.817
and the answers are "I don't know, because no one does,"

00:17:51.817 --> 00:17:53.558
or "What's the question?" Even better.

00:17:53.558 --> 00:17:55.948
Or, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone,

00:17:55.964 --> 00:17:58.664
I'll phone someone. I'll find out."

00:17:58.664 --> 00:18:00.214
Because that's what we want people to do,

00:18:00.214 --> 00:18:01.585
and that's how you evaluate them.

00:18:01.585 --> 00:18:03.528
And maybe for the advanced placement classes,

00:18:03.528 --> 00:18:07.242
it could be, "Here's the answer. What's the next question?"

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:08.753
That's the one I like in particular.

00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:10.930
So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.097
who said "Education is not about filling buckets;

00:18:14.097 --> 00:18:16.250
it is lighting fires."

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.125
So I'd say, let's get out the matches.

00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:21.333
Thank you.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:24.560
(Applause)

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.376
Thank you. (Applause)
