00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.779
It's a pleasure to be here

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.728
in Edinburgh, Scotland,

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.891
the birthplace of the needle and syringe.

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.732
Less than a mile from here in this direction,

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.706
in 1853 a Scotsman

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:26.134
filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:28.236
His name was Alexander Wood,

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.987
and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:34.465
This is the patent.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.176
What blows my mind when I look at it even today

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:39.349
is that it looks almost identical

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.106
to the needle in use today.

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:44.666
Yet, it's 160 years old.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.161
So we turn to the field of vaccines.

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.390
Most vaccines are delivered with

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.534
the needle and syringe, 
this 160-year-old technology.

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:55.445
And credit where it's due -- on many levels,

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:59.096
vaccines are a successful technology.

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.985
After clean water and sanitation,

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:07.259
vaccines are the one technology that has increased

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.789
our life span the most.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.264
That's a pretty hard act to beat.

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:14.057
But just like any other technology,

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:15.902
vaccines have their shortcomings,

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:18.538
and the needle and syringe

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:20.741
is a key part within that narrative --

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:23.670
this old technology.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969
So let's start with the obvious:

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.451
Many of us don't like the needle and syringe.

00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:31.365
I share that view.

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:34.557
However, 20 percent of the population

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:36.833
have a thing called needle phobia.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.594
That's more than disliking the needle;

00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:41.063
that is actively avoiding being vaccinated

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:42.927
because of needle phobia.

00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:46.934
And that's problematic in terms 
of the rollout of vaccines.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.079
Now, related to this is another key issue,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.412
which is needlestick injuries.

00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:53.384
And the WHO has figures

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:57.219
that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.611
take place due to cross-contamination

00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.895
with needlestick injuries.

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:03.577
These are early deaths that take place.

00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:06.558
Now, these are two things that 
you probably may have heard of,

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:08.438
but there are two other shortcomings

00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:10.922
of the needle and syringe you 
may not have heard about.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.903
One is it could be holding back

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.382
the next generation of vaccines

00:02:14.382 --> 00:02:16.671
in terms of their immune responses.

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.598
And the second is that it could be responsible

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:24.210
for the problem of the cold chain
that I'll tell you about as well.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.792
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.860
that my team and I are doing in Australia

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.601
at the University of Queensland

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.998
on a technology designed to 
tackle those four problems.

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:38.343
And that technology is called the Nanopatch.

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:44.817
Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.

00:02:44.817 --> 00:02:46.466
To the naked eye

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.650
it just looks like a square

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.549
smaller than a postage stamp,

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.215
but under a microscope

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.533
what you see are thousands of tiny projections

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.754
that are invisible to the human eye.

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:00.511
And there's about 4,000 projections

00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:03.893
on this particular square compared to the needle.

00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:06.551
And I've designed those projections

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:10.601
to serve a key role, which is to 
work with the skin's immune system.

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.996
So that's a very important function

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.452
tied in with the Nanopatch.

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:16.699
Now we make the Nanopatch

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.236
with a technique

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.615
called deep reactive ion etching.

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.659
And this particular technique 
is one that's been borrowed

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.286
from the semiconductor industry,

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:27.122
and therefore is low cost

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:29.316
and can be rolled out in large numbers.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:34.382
Now we dry-coat vaccines to 
the projections of the Nanopatch

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:36.201
and apply it to the skin.

00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:40.757
Now, the simplest form of application

00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:42.779
is using our finger,

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.399
but our finger has some limitations,

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.483
so we've devised an applicator.

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:48.970
And it's a very simple device --

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.088
you could call it a sophisticated finger.

00:03:51.088 --> 00:03:54.128
It's a spring-operated device.

00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:57.950
What we do is when we apply 
the Nanopatch to the skin as so --

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.819
(Click) --

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.736
immediately a few things happen.

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:06.783
So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch

00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:08.460
breach through the tough outer layer

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.506
and the vaccine is very quickly released --

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.854
within less than a minute, in fact.

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:15.420
Then we can take the Nanopatch off

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.358
and discard it.

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:23.244
And indeed we can make 
a reuse of the applicator itself.

00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:25.980
So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.556
and immediately you can see some key advantages.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:30.496
We've talked about it being needle-free --

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.730
these are projections that you can't even see --

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.441
and, of course, we get around

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.514
the needle phobia issue as well.

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:39.445
Now, if we take a step back and think about

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.841
these other two really important advantages:

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:46.877
One is improved immune 
responses through delivery,

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:50.471
and the second is getting rid of the cold chain.

00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.843
So let's start with the first one, 
this immunogenicity idea.

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:54.849
It takes a little while to get our heads around,

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.578
but I'll try to explain it in simple terms.

00:04:58.578 --> 00:05:00.428
So I'll take a step back and explain to you

00:05:00.428 --> 00:05:03.838
how vaccines work in a simple way.

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:06.415
So vaccines work by introducing into our body

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:08.518
a thing called an antigen

00:05:08.518 --> 00:05:11.695
which is a safe form of a germ.

00:05:11.695 --> 00:05:13.715
Now that safe germ, that antigen,

00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:17.220
tricks our body into mounting an immune response,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.288
learning and remembering 
how to deal with intruders.

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.656
When the real intruder comes along

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.417
the body quickly mounts an immune response

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:27.053
to deal with that vaccine

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:28.953
and neutralizes the infection.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.643
So it does that well.

00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:32.980
Now, the way it's done today 
with the needle and syringe,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.431
most vaccines are delivered that way --

00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.115
with this old technology and the needle.

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:42.264
But it could be argued that the needle 
is holding back our immune responses;

00:05:42.264 --> 00:05:45.706
it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:48.702
To describe this idea,

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:51.191
we need to take a journey through the skin,

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:53.815
starting with one of those projections

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.260
and applying the Nanopatch to the skin.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.660
And we see this kind of data.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.469
Now, this is real data --

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.815
that thing that we can see there is one projection

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:05.271
from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin

00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:07.196
and those colors are different layers.

00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:08.480
Now, to give you an idea of scale,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.420
if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.945
It would be 10 times bigger

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:14.867
than the size of that screen,
going 10 times deeper as well.

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.082
It's off the grid entirely.

00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:20.275
You can see immediately that we 
have those projections in the skin.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.327
That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,

00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:25.834
but the brown layer and the magenta layer

00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:29.022
are jammed full of immune cells.

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:30.878
As one example, in the brown layer

00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:33.232
there's a certain type of cell 
called a Langerhans cell --

00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:35.445
every square millimeter of our body

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:38.465
is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.568
those immune cells, and 
there's others shown as well

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.363
that we haven't stained in this image.

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:44.543
But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch

00:06:44.543 --> 00:06:46.280
achieves that penetration indeed.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.709
We target thousands upon thousands 
of these particular cells

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.047
just residing within a hair's width

00:06:52.047 --> 00:06:55.328
of the surface of the skin.

00:06:55.328 --> 00:06:59.090
Now, as the guy that's invented
this thing and designed it to do that,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.526
I found that exciting. But so what?

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:04.478
So what if you've targeted cells?

00:07:04.478 --> 00:07:07.281
In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.702
The world of vaccines is getting better.

00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:11.426
It's getting more systematic.

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:13.648
However, you still don't really know

00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:15.392
if a vaccine is going to work

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:16.731
until you roll your sleeves up

00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.946
and vaccinate and wait.

00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:21.648
It's a gambler's game even today.

00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:24.160
So, we had to do that gamble.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.640
We obtained an influenza vaccine,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.256
we applied it to our Nanopatches

00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:30.727
and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:32.460
and we waited --

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.288
and this is in the live animal.

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.139
We waited a month,

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.951
and this is what we found out.

00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:40.276
This is a data slide showing the immune responses

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:42.599
that we've generated with a Nanopatch

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:46.375
compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:49.969
So on the horizontal axis we have 
the dose shown in nanograms.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.674
On the vertical axis we have 
the immune response generated,

00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:58.189
and that dashed line indicates 
the protection threshold.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.642
If we're above that line it's considered protective;

00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:03.568
if we're below that line it's not.

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:06.136
So the red line is mostly below that curve

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:09.660
and indeed there's only one point that 
is achieved with the needle that's protective,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.869
and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:15.402
But notice immediately the distinctly different curve

00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:18.466
that we achieve with the blue line.

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.366
That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.103
the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:25.464
a completely different immunogenicity curve.

00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:27.297
That's a real fresh opportunity.

00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:29.675
Suddenly we have a brand new lever

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.203
in the world of vaccines.

00:08:31.203 --> 00:08:32.714
We can push it one way,

00:08:32.714 --> 00:08:35.305
where we can take a vaccine 
that works but is too expensive

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:36.964
and can get protection

00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:39.788
with a hundredth of the dose 
compared to the needle.

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:43.839
That can take a vaccine that's suddenly 
10 dollars down to 10 cents,

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:47.019
and that's particularly important 
within the developing world.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:48.886
But there's another angle to this as well --

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:51.938
you can take vaccines that currently don't work

00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:53.134
and get them over that line

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:55.092
and get them protective.

00:08:55.092 --> 00:08:57.320
And certainly in the world of vaccines

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.540
that can be important.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.038
Let's consider the big three:

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.735
HIV, malaria, tuberculosis.

00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:05.327
They're responsible for about 
7 million deaths per year,

00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:08.534
and there is no adequate vaccination 
method for any of those.

00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:11.066
So potentially, with this new lever 
that we have with the Nanopatch,

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:12.901
we can help make that happen.

00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:17.771
We can push that lever to help get those 
candidate vaccines over the line.

00:09:17.771 --> 00:09:19.589
Now, of course, we've worked within my lab

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:21.379
with many other vaccines that have attained

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:24.197
similar responses and similar curves to this,

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:27.962
what we've achieved with influenza.

00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:30.121
I'd like to now switch to talk about

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.453
another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,

00:09:33.453 --> 00:09:36.873
and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.

00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:39.547
As the name suggests -- the cold chain --

00:09:39.547 --> 00:09:42.487
it's the requirements of keeping 
a vaccine right from production

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:45.163
all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,

00:09:45.163 --> 00:09:48.261
to keep it refrigerated.

00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:51.507
Now, that presents some logistical challenges

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:54.497
but we have ways to do it.

00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:59.033
This is a slightly extreme case in point

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.516
but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:03.906
in particular in resource-poor settings,

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:07.192
of what's required to get vaccines

00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:08.910
refrigerated and maintain the cold chain.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.724
If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,

00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:14.931
but interestingly it can be too cold

00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:17.492
and the vaccine can break down as well.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.874
Now, the stakes are very high.

00:10:20.874 --> 00:10:23.409
The WHO estimates that within Africa,

00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:26.060
up to half the vaccines used there

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.913
are considered to not be working properly

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:30.903
because at some point the 
cold chain has fallen over.

00:10:30.903 --> 00:10:33.469
So it's a big problem, and it's tied 
in with the needle and syringe

00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:38.702
because it's a liquid form vaccine, and 
when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.

00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:41.213
A key attribute of our Nanopatch

00:10:41.213 --> 00:10:43.186
is that the vaccine is dry,

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:45.975
and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.

00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:48.387
Within my lab we've shown that we can keep

00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:51.067
the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.783
for more than a year without 
any loss in activity at all.

00:10:54.783 --> 00:10:57.170
That's an important improvement.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:03.770
(Applause)

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.233
We're delighted about it as well.

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:10.529
And the thing about it is that
we have well and truly proven

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:13.192
the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.

00:11:13.192 --> 00:11:17.165
And as a scientist, I love that and I love science.

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:19.673
However, as an engineer,

00:11:19.673 --> 00:11:21.386
as a biomedical engineer

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:23.589
and also as a human being,

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:24.820
I'm not going to be satisfied

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.513
until we've rolled this thing 
out, taken it out of the lab

00:11:27.513 --> 00:11:29.944
and got it to people in large numbers

00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:33.480
and particularly the people that need it the most.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.182
So we've commenced this particular journey,

00:11:36.182 --> 00:11:38.843
and we've commenced this 
journey in an unusual way.

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:41.832
We've started with Papua New Guinea.

00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:47.637
Now, Papua New Guinea is an example 
of a developing world country.

00:11:47.637 --> 00:11:50.773
It's about the same size as France,

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.608
but it suffers from many of the key barriers

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:57.676
existing within the world of today's vaccines.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.289
There's the logistics:

00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:03.647
Within this country there are only 800 
refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:07.940
Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,
many of them are breaking down

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.856
and many are not in the Highlands 
where they are required.

00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.319
That's a challenge.

00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:17.502
But also, Papua New Guinea has the 
world's highest incidence of HPV,

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:21.733
human papillomavirus, the 
cervical cancer [risk factor].

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:24.434
Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:26.348
because it's too expensive.

00:12:26.348 --> 00:12:29.094
So for those two reasons, with 
the attributes of the Nanopatch,

00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:31.709
we've got into the field and 
worked with the Nanopatch,

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.160
and taken it to Papua New Guinea

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.143
and we'll be following that up shortly.

00:12:38.143 --> 00:12:41.625
Now, doing this kind of work is not easy.

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.973
It's challenging,

00:12:42.973 --> 00:12:46.297
but there's nothing else in 
the world I'd rather be doing.

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:48.320
And as we look ahead

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.062
I'd like to share with you a thought:

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:56.070
It's the thought of a future where

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.003
the 17 million deaths per year

00:12:58.003 --> 00:13:00.347
that we currently have due to infectious disease

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:02.981
is a historical footnote.

00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:05.077
And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved

00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:08.545
by improved, radically improved vaccines.

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:10.828
Now standing here today in front of you

00:13:10.828 --> 00:13:12.501
at the birthplace of the needle and syringe,

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:15.298
a device that's 160 years old,

00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:17.634
I'm presenting to you an alternative approach

00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:19.883
that could really help make that happen --

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:23.865
and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes 
of being needle-free, pain-free,

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:28.296
the ability for removing the cold chain
and improving the immunogenicity.

00:13:28.296 --> 00:13:30.249
Thank you.

00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:33.417
(Applause)
