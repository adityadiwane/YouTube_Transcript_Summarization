00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Take a look at this picture.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
These African students are doing their homework

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
because they don't have any electricity at home.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
Now, I haven't met these particular students,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
but I've met students like them.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
So here is the puzzle.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Why is it that Nelson has access

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
for generating electric light in the home?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
when people can bring new technologies in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and make them available to someone like Nelson.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
What kinds of rules?

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
The electric company in this nation

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
electricity at a very low, subsidized price --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
to hook up many other users.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
The president wanted to change this rule.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
rules where businesses earn a small profit,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
The president has seen how those rules worked well.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
but ran into a firestorm of protest

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
from businesses and consumers

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
from letting the win-win solution help his country.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
how we can change rules.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.330
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
that we can make practical,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
and more choices to leaders --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
who, in many countries, are also people.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
(Laughter)

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
a choice like giving the president the choice

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
to raise prices on electricity,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
subsidized electric power.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
So if you give just to one side or the other,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
you'll have tension or friction.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
that will give us a set of rules

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.330
for changing rules that get us out of traps.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
And he says that if you want to see

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
the damaging effects of rules,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
In particular check out Asia.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
If you zoom in here,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
you can see North Korea, in outline here,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Now, you won't be surprised to learn

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
that the rules in North Korea

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
keep people there in the dark.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
But it is important to recognize

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
that North Korea and South Korea

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
started out with identical sets of rules

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
in both the sense of laws and regulations,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
but also in the deeper senses of understandings,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
norms, culture, values and beliefs.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
When they separated, they made choices

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
that led to very divergent paths

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
for their sets of rules.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that we use to interact with each other,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
for better, or for worse.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Zoom in on Haiti,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
in outline here.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Haiti is also dark,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
which has about the same number of residents.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
which has half as many residents

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
What Haiti warns us is that

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
rules can be bad because governments are weak.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
It's not just that the rules are bad because

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
we can't just tear down.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.330
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
Now, China dramatically demonstrates

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
both the potential and the challenges

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
of working with rules.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
China was the world's high-technology leader.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And they soon adopted rules which

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
slowed down innovation

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
and cut China off from the rest of the world.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
So as other countries in the world innovated,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
in the sense both of developing

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
newer technologies,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
but also developing newer rules,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.330
the Chinese were cut off from those advances.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
Income there stayed stagnant,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
This next chart looks at more recent data.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
It plots income, average income in China

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
as a percentage of average income in the United States.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
But then in the late '70s something changed.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
very quickly with the United States.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
The brightest spot in China,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
is Hong Kong.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Hong Kong was a small bit of China

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
that, for most of the 20th century,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
operated under a very different set of rules

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
than the rest of mainland China --

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
rules that were copied

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
from working market economies of the time,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
and administered by the British.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
millions of people could go, from the mainland,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.330
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
But, to get on a process of increasing income,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
increasing skills

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
led to very rapid growth there.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
Hong Kong was also the model

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
which leaders like Deng Xiaoping

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
could copy, when they decided to move

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
all of the mainland towards the market model.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.330
the importance of offering choices to his people.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
So instead of forcing everyone in China

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
to shift immediately to the market model,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
they proceeded by creating some special zones

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
zones where Chinese could come and work,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
and cities grew up very rapidly there;

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
also zones where foreign firms could come in

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
and make things.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
that made the iPhone that many of you have,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
and they made it with labor from Chinese

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
who moved there to Shenzhen.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
So after the four special zones,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
there were 14 coastal cites

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
that were open in the same sense,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
and eventually demonstrated successes

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
in these places that people could opt in to,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.330
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:33.330
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
One is: preserve choices for people.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Two: operate on the right scale.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
but a village would be too small

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
all working under good rules.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
On the other hand, the nation is too big.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
If you try to change the rules in the nation,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
you can't give some people a chance

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
to hold back, see how things turn out,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
But cities give you this opportunity

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
to create new places,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
with new rules that people can opt in to.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And they're large enough

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
to get all of the benefits that we can have

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.330
when millions of us work together under good rules.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
So the proposal is that we

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
conceive of something called a charter city.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
We start with a charter that specifies

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
all the rules required

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.330
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
We'll need to attract the investors

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
who will build out the infrastructure --

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
You'll need to attract firms,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.330
who will come hire the people who move there first.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
And you'll need to attract families,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
the residents who will come and live there permanently,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
raise their children, get an education for their children,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
and get their first job.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
With that charter, people will move there.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
The city can be built.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
And we can scale this model.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
We can go do it over and over again.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
Those are captured in the charter.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
We also need the choices for people.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
That's really built into the model

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
if we allow for the possibility of building cities

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
on uninhabited land.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
You start from uninhabited territory.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
People can come live under the new charter,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
but no one is forced to live under it.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.330
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
cases where nations work together,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
in effect, de facto,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
the way China and Britain worked together

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and then scale it throughout China.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
through its actions in Hong Kong,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
did more to reduce world poverty

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
than all the aid programs that we've undertaken

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
in the last century.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
to replicate this again,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.330
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.330
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
a delegation of control from one country to another

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.330
to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Now, when I say that,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
some of you are starting to think,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.330
"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.330
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
that come up when we start to think about these things,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
can get in the way, can make us pull back,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
can shut down our ability,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
Why is this not like colonialism?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
The thing that was bad about colonialism,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
is that it involved elements of

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
coercion and condescension.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
This model is all about choices,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
It must have occurred to Castro

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
that he has the chance to do for Cuba

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
what Deng Xiaoping did for China,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.330
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.330
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
that has a very special status.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
where a treaty gives the United States

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
administrative responsibility

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
They want to get out.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
Why don't you, Canada, take over?

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Build -- run a special administrative zone.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
Allow a new city to be built up there.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
Allow many people to come in.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Others will hold back. But this will be

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
the gateway that will connect

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
the modern economy and the modern world

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
to my country."

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
Now, where else might this model be tried?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.330
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
that people can opt into as a rule.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
It's a rule for changing rules.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
They also totally get the idea that in some instances

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.330
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
the kind of investors who will come build the port,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
build the roads, in a new city --

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
they can make more credible promises

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
if they do it along with a partner nation.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Perhaps even in some arrangement

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
that's a little bit like an escrow account,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
where you put land in the escrow account

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
There is also lots of land in Africa

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
where new cities could be built.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
There are immense stretches of land like this --

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
Now, if we generalize this and think about

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.330
cities that will help create places for the

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
who will move to cities in the coming century --

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
is there enough land for them?

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
like most of the world is already built out.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
So let me show you why that's wrong.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
Take this representation of all of the land.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
Turn it into a square that stands for

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
all the arable land on Earth.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
by the cities that three billion people now live in.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.330
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
they would be dots like this.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.330
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
by building more cities that people can move to.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
And if these are cities governed by good rules,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
safe from disease and bad sanitation,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
where people have a chance to get a job.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
They can get basic utilities like electricity.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
Their kids can get an education.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
So what will it take to get started

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
building the first charter cities,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
scaling this so we build many more?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
It would help to have a manual.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
(Laughter)

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
What university professors could do

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
is write some details that might go into this manual.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
go out and design them.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
suppose it isn't just Canada

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
that does the deal with Raul Castro.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
How would we write the treaty to do that?

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
How would we finance this?

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
are cities that made huge gains

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
You could use the gains on the value of the land

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
to pay for things like the police, the courts,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
but the school system and the health care system too,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
which make this a more attractive place to live,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.330
which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.330
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
and build it, and set up the basic rules,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
go very much in the right direction.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.330
So there are many other details like this.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
How could we have buildings that are

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.330
low cost and affordable for people who work

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.330
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
but make those buildings energy efficient,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.330
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
in an earthquake or a hurricane.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Many technical details to be worked out,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.330
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
can already tell that there is no roadblock,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.330
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
that will keep us from delivering on

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:20.330
a truly global win-win solution.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Let me conclude with this picture.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
The reason we can be so well off,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
even though there is so many people on earth,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
is because of the power of ideas.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
We can share ideas with other people,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.330
and when they discover them, they share with us.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
It's not like scarce objects,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
where sharing means we each get less.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
When we share ideas we all get more.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
When we think about ideas in that way,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
we usually think about technologies.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
But there is another class of ideas:

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.330
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.330
rules like, let's have a tax system

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.330
that supports a research university

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.330
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
that is registered in a government office,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.330
that people can pledge as collateral.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.330
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.330
and particularly innovate in the sense

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
of coming up with rules for changing rules,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
so we don't get stuck with bad rules,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330
then we can keep moving progress forward

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
and truly make the world a better place,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.330
so that people like Nelson and his friends

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.330
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.330
(Applause)
