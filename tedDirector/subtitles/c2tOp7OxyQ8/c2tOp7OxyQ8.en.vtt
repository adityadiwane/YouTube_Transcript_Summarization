00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I spend most of my time

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in jails, in prisons, on death row.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And being here at TED

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
has been very, very energizing to me.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is that TED has an identity.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And you can actually say things here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that have impacts around the world.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And sometimes when it comes through TED,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
it has meaning and power

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
that it doesn't have when it doesn't.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And we've had some fantastic presentations.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And I think what we've learned

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but if you're a compassionate teacher,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
they can be especially meaningful.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
If you're a doctor you can do some good things,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And I didn't learn about this actually

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
practicing law and doing the work that I do.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I grew up in a house

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that was the traditional African-American home

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that was dominated by a matriarch,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and that matriarch was my grandmother.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
She was tough, she was strong,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
she was powerful.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
She was the end of every argument in our family.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
She was born in the 1880's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and the experience of slavery

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
very much shaped the way she saw the world.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
When I would see her as a little boy,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and then she'd let me go.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And she just had this quality

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that you always wanted to be near her.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
it would be difficult to get her time and attention.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
My cousins would be running around everywhere.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
waking up one morning, going into the living room,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and all of my cousins were running around.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And my grandmother was sitting across the room

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
staring at me.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And at first I thought we were playing a game.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And I would look at her and I'd smile,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
but she was very serious.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
she got up and she came across the room

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and she took me by the hand

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
I never will forget it.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I said, "Okay, Mama."

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Then she sat me down and she looked at me

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and she said, "I want you to know

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I've been watching you."

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And she said, "I think you're special."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I will never forget it.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I said, "Okay, Mama."

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
is that you'll always love your mom."

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
She said, "That's my baby girl,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is that you'll always do the right thing

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
even when the right thing is the hard thing."

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
is that you'll never drink alcohol."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
(Laughter)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
I grew up in the country in the rural South,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
When I was about 14 or 15,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I don't know where he got it --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and they offered it to me.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And then my brother started staring at me.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Then he looked at me real hard and he said,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
on that conversation Mama had with you."

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
(Laughter)

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I was devastated.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
(Laughter)

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And I'm going to admit something to you.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I know this might be broadcast broadly.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But I'm 52 years old,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and I'm going to admit to you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
that I've never had a drop of alcohol.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
(Applause)

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I say that because there is power in identity.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
When we create the right kind of identity,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
we can say things to the world around us

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that they don't actually believe makes sense.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
We can get them to do things

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that they don't think they can do.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
When I thought about my grandmother,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
of course she would think all her grandkids were special.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Well I've been trying to say something

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
about our criminal justice system.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
This country is very different today

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
than it was 40 years ago.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Today, there are 2.3 million.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
in the world.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We have seven million people on probation and parole.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
has fundamentally changed our world.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
In poor communities, in communities of color

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
there is this despair,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
there is this hopelessness,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that is being shaped by these outcomes.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
One out of three black men

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
between the ages of 18 and 30

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
In urban communities across this country --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in jail or prison or on probation or parole.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Our system isn't just being shaped

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
they're also distorted by poverty.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
We have a system of justice in this country

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
that treats you much better

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Wealth, not culpability,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
shapes outcomes.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The politics of fear and anger

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
have made us believe

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
that these are problems that are not our problems.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We've been disconnected.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It's interesting to me.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
My state of Alabama, like a number of states,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
actually permanently disenfranchises you

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
if you have a criminal conviction.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Right now in Alabama

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
34 percent of the black male population

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
has permanently lost the right to vote.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
We're actually projecting in another 10 years

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
the level of disenfranchisement

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
will be as high as it's been

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And there is this stunning silence.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
I represent children.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
A lot of my clients are very young.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
The United States is the only country in the world

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
where we sentence 13-year-old children

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to die in prison.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And we're actually doing some litigation.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
The only country in the world.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
I represent people on death row.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
In many ways, we've been taught to think

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that the real question is,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And that's a very sensible question.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But there's another way of thinking

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
about where we are in our identity.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
The other way of thinking about it

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
but do we deserve to kill?

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Death penalty in America is defined by error.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
For every nine people who have been executed,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
we've actually identified one innocent person

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
who's been exonerated and released from death row.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
A kind of astonishing error rate --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
one out of nine people innocent.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
if for every nine planes that took off

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
one would crash.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
It's not our problem.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
It's not our burden.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
It's not our struggle.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
I talk a lot about these issues.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
I talk about race and this question

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
of whether we deserve to kill.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
I tell them about slavery.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I tell them about terrorism,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
the era that began at the end of reconstruction

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
that went on to World War II.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
We don't really know very much about it.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
But for African-Americans in this country,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
that was an era defined by terror.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
They had to worry about being bombed.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And these older people come up to me now

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
you tell people to stop saying

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
after 9/11."

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And that era of terrorism, of course,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
was followed by segregation

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and decades of racial subordination

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and apartheid.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
where we really don't like to talk about our problems.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
We don't like to talk about our history.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And because of that, we really haven't understood

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
We're constantly running into each other.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
We have a hard time talking about race,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to a process of truth and reconciliation.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
In South Africa, people understood

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that we couldn't overcome apartheid

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
but in this country we haven't done that.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
It was fascinating

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
to hear what you're talking about."

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And the room got very quiet,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and this woman said,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
"There's no way, with our history,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
we could ever engage

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
in the systematic killing of human beings.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
It would be unconscionable for us

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
to, in an intentional and deliberate way,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
set about executing people."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And I thought about that.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
What would it feel like

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
to be living in a world

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
where the nation state of Germany was executing people,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I couldn't bear it.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
It would be unconscionable.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And yet, in this country,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
in the states of the Old South,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
we execute people --

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
if the victim is white than if the victim is black,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
22 times more likely to get it

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
if the defendant is black and the victim is white --

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
in the very states where there are buried in the ground

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
the bodies of people who were lynched.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And yet, there is this disconnect.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
That when we actually don't care

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
about these difficult things,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
the positive and wonderful things

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
are nonetheless implicated.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
We love innovation.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
We love technology. We love creativity.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
We love entertainment.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
But ultimately,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
those realities

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
are shadowed by suffering,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
abuse, degradation,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
marginalization.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And for me, it becomes necessary

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
to integrate the two.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Because ultimately we are talking

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
about a need to be more hopeful,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
more committed, more dedicated

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And for me that means

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
spending time thinking and talking

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
about the poor, the disadvantaged,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
those who will never get to TED.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
But thinking about them in a way

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
that is integrated in our own lives.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.260
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Innovation, creativity,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
development comes

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
not from the ideas in our mind alone.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
They come from the ideas in our mind

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
that are also fueled

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
by some conviction in our heart.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And it's that mind-heart connection

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that I believe compels us

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
to not just be attentive

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
to all the bright and dazzly things,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
but also the dark and difficult things.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
we wanted all kinds of things,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
but mostly what we needed was hope,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
an orientation of the spirit,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
and be a witness."

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Well that orientation of the spirit

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
is very much at the core of what I believe

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
even TED communities

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
have to be engaged in.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
There is no disconnect

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
around technology and design

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
that will allow us to be fully human

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
until we pay attention to suffering,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Now I will warn you

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
that this kind of identity

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
is a much more challenging identity

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
than ones that don't pay attention to this.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
It will get to you.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
these older women,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Johnnie Carr who was the organizer

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
of the Montgomery bus boycott --

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
amazing African-American woman --

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and Virginia Durr, a white woman,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And these women would get together and just talk.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Do you want to come over and listen?"

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
I said, "I'm going to listen."

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
It would be so energizing and so empowering.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Tell me what you're trying to do."

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And I began giving her my rap.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
in the administration of criminal justice.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
We're trying to reduce the prison population.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
We're trying to end mass incarceration."

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
(Laughter)

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:28.260
she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And I actually believe that the TED community

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
needs to be more courageous.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
We need to find ways

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
to embrace these challenges,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
these problems, the suffering.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Because ultimately, our humanity depends

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
on everyone's humanity.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
It's just taught me very simple things.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
I've come to understand and to believe

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
that each of us

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
is more than the worst thing we've ever done.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
I believe that for every person on the planet.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
they're not just a thief.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And because of that there's this basic human dignity

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
that must be respected by law.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
I also believe

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
that in many parts of this country,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and certainly in many parts of this globe,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
I don't believe that.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I actually think, in too many places,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
the opposite of poverty is justice.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
And finally, I believe

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
and so beautiful and so inspiring

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
and so stimulating,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
we won't be judged by our design,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
but by how they treat the poor,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
the condemned, the incarcerated.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Because it's in that nexus

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
that we actually begin to understand truly profound things

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.260
about who we are.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
I sometimes push too hard.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
I do get tired, as we all do.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
in ways that are important.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
And I've been representing these kids

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
How can a judge turn you into something

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
that you're not?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
the judge must have magic power.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
You should ask for some of that.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
I started working on a motion.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And I started working on this motion,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
14-year-old black male client

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
like a privileged, white 75-year-old

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
corporate executive."

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.260
(Applause)

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
And I put in my motion

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
it's all misconduct.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
or did I actually write it?

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And to my horror, not only had I written it,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
but I had sent it to court.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
(Applause)

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
A couple months went by,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
and I had just forgotten all about it.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
And I finally decided,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
And I got into my car

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
When this man saw me, he came over to me

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
and he said, "Who are you?"

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
And this man came over to me

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
and he hugged me.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
And he whispered in my ear.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
He said, "I'm so proud of you."

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
And I have to tell you,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
it was energizing.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
It connected deeply with something in me

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
about identity,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
about the capacity of every person to contribute

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
Well I went into the courtroom.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.260
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260
I had written these crazy things.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.260
And police officers were coming in

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
angry that we were talking about race,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
that we were talking about poverty,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
that we were talking about inequality.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.260
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.260
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
He kept pacing back and forth.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.260
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.260
came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.260
almost at counsel table.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260
that the janitor had come into court.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.260
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.260
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
And this older black man stood up

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.260
and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.260
and he said, "I came into this courtroom

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.260
to tell this young man,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.260
keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.260
I've come to TED

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.260
because I believe that many of you understand

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.260
that the moral arc of the universe is long,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.260
but it bends toward justice.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.260
That we cannot be full evolved human beings

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.260
until we care about human rights and basic dignity.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
That all of our survival

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
is tied to the survival of everyone.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.260
That our visions of technology and design

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.260
and entertainment and creativity

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.260
have to be married with visions

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.260
of humanity, compassion and justice.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
And more than anything,

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.260
for those of you who share that,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
I've simply come to tell you

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.260
Thank you very much.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:29.260
(Applause)

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.260
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.260
an obvious desire by this audience, this community,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.260
to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.260
Other than writing a check,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.260
what could we do?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.260
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.260
If you live in the state of California, for example,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.260
there's a referendum coming up this spring

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.260
where actually there's going to be an effort

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.260
to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.260
For example, here in California

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
we're going to spend one billion dollars

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
on the death penalty in the next five years --

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.260
one billion dollars.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.260
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.260
don't result in arrest.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.260
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260
So there's an opportunity to change that.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.260
And this referendum would propose having those dollars

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.260
go to law enforcement and safety.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.260
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.260
CA: There's been this huge decline

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.260
in crime in America over the last three decades.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.260
And part of the narrative of that

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.260
is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.260
What would you say to someone who believed that?

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.260
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.260
has remained relatively stable.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.260
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.260
wasn't really in violent crime categories.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.260
It was this misguided war on drugs.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.260
That's where the dramatic increases have come

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.260
in our prison population.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.260
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260
And so we have three strikes laws

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
that put people in prison forever

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.260
for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.260
rather than making them give those resources back

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.260
to the people who they victimized.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.260
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.260
not do less.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.260
And I think our current punishment philosophy

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.260
does nothing for no one.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.260
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.260
(Applause)

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.260
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.260
You're an inspiring person.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.260
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:34.260
(Applause)
