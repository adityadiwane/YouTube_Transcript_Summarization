00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.136
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.136
And I would like to tell you
a few personal stories

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.136
about what I like to call
"the danger of the single story."

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:26.136
I grew up on a university campus
in eastern Nigeria.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.627
My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two,

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:32.667
although I think four
is probably close to the truth.

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:35.724
So I was an early reader,

00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:39.136
and what I read were British
and American children's books.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.136
I was also an early writer,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.136
and when I began to write,
at about the age of seven,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.208
stories in pencil
with crayon illustrations

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:51.764
that my poor mother was obligated to read,

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:55.356
I wrote exactly the kinds
of stories I was reading:

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.136
All my characters were
white and blue-eyed,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.467
they played in the snow,

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.578
they ate apples,

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.999
(Laughter)

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.184
and they talked a lot about the weather,

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.336
how lovely it was
that the sun had come out.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.533
(Laughter)

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.691
Now, this despite the fact
that I lived in Nigeria.

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:17.493
I had never been outside Nigeria.

00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:22.564
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:24.436
and we never talked about the weather,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.136
because there was no need to.

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.136
My characters also drank
a lot of ginger beer,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.541
because the characters
in the British books I read

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.136
drank ginger beer.

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.136
Never mind that I had no idea
what ginger beer was.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.691
(Laughter)

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.165
And for many years afterwards,

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.136
I would have a desperate desire
to taste ginger beer.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.136
But that is another story.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.643
What this demonstrates, I think,

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.521
is how impressionable
and vulnerable we are

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:51.136
in the face of a story,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.545
particularly as children.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.569
Because all I had read were books
in which characters were foreign,

00:01:57.593 --> 00:01:59.712
I had become convinced that books

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:02.906
by their very nature
had to have foreigners in them

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.649
and had to be about things with which
I could not personally identify.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.379
Now, things changed
when I discovered African books.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.136
There weren't many of them available,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.029
and they weren't quite as easy to find
as the foreign books.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:19.136
But because of writers like
Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.136
I went through a mental shift
in my perception of literature.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.374
I realized that people like me,

00:02:25.398 --> 00:02:27.405
girls with skin the color of chocolate,

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.691
whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.525
could also exist in literature.

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:36.136
I started to write
about things I recognized.

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:40.136
Now, I loved those
American and British books I read.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.136
They stirred my imagination.
They opened up new worlds for me.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.136
But the unintended consequence

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.208
was that I did not know
that people like me

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:49.658
could exist in literature.

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.136
So what the discovery of African writers
did for me was this:

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.037
It saved me from having a single story
of what books are.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.136
I come from a conventional,
middle-class Nigerian family.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.136
My father was a professor.

00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:06.228
My mother was an administrator.

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.331
And so we had, as was the norm,

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:14.704
live-in domestic help, who would often
come from nearby rural villages.

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:18.628
So, the year I turned eight,
we got a new house boy.

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:20.516
His name was Fide.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:26.119
The only thing my mother told us about him
was that his family was very poor.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.136
My mother sent yams and rice,
and our old clothes, to his family.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.780
And when I didn't finish my dinner,
my mother would say,

00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:39.136
"Finish your food! Don't you know?
People like Fide's family have nothing."

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.136
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:46.633
Then one Saturday,
we went to his village to visit,

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:50.136
and his mother showed us
a beautifully patterned basket

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.136
made of dyed raffia
that his brother had made.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.136
I was startled.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.136
It had not occurred to me
that anybody in his family

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.136
could actually make something.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.136
All I had heard about them
was how poor they were,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.627
so that it had become impossible for me
to see them as anything else but poor.

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:11.674
Their poverty was my single story of them.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.684
Years later, I thought about this
when I left Nigeria

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.390
to go to university in the United States.

00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:19.834
I was 19.

00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:23.358
My American roommate was shocked by me.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.746
She asked where I had learned
to speak English so well,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.858
and was confused when I said that Nigeria

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.596
happened to have English
as its official language.

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:38.136
She asked if she could listen
to what she called my "tribal music,"

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.136
and was consequently very disappointed

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.136
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.136
(Laughter)

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.853
She assumed that I did not know
how to use a stove.

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:51.198
What struck me was this:

00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:54.297
She had felt sorry for me
even before she saw me.

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:58.136
Her default position
toward me, as an African,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.196
was a kind of patronizing,
well-meaning pity.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.656
My roommate had a single story of Africa:

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:08.137
a single story of catastrophe.

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:09.858
In this single story,

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:14.136
there was no possibility of Africans
being similar to her in any way,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.136
no possibility of feelings
more complex than pity,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.136
no possibility of a connection
as human equals.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.283
I must say that before I went to the U.S.,

00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:25.588
I didn't consciously identify as African.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.136
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,
people turned to me.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.906
Never mind that I knew nothing
about places like Namibia.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.256
But I did come to embrace
this new identity,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.136
and in many ways I think
of myself now as African.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.136
Although I still get quite irritable
when Africa is referred to as a country,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.136
the most recent example being
my otherwise wonderful flight

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.445
from Lagos two days ago,

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.351
in which there was an announcement
on the Virgin flight

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:55.136
about the charity work in "India,
Africa and other countries."

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.477
(Laughter)

00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:00.136
So, after I had spent some years
in the U.S. as an African,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.334
I began to understand
my roommate's response to me.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.185
If I had not grown up in Nigeria,

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.350
and if all I knew about Africa
were from popular images,

00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:14.546
I too would think that Africa
was a place of beautiful landscapes,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.136
beautiful animals,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.136
and incomprehensible people,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.791
fighting senseless wars,
dying of poverty and AIDS,

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.136
unable to speak for themselves

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.315
and waiting to be saved
by a kind, white foreigner.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.257
I would see Africans
in the same way that I,

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.984
as a child, had seen Fide's family.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.136
This single story of Africa ultimately
comes, I think, from Western literature.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.136
Now, here is a quote from the writing
of a London merchant called John Lok,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.136
who sailed to west Africa in 1561

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.823
and kept a fascinating
account of his voyage.

00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:56.136
After referring to the black Africans
as "beasts who have no houses,"

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.136
he writes, "They are also
people without heads,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.128
having their mouth and eyes
in their breasts."

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.256
Now, I've laughed
every time I've read this.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.660
And one must admire
the imagination of John Lok.

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:13.399
But what is important about his writing

00:07:13.423 --> 00:07:15.136
is that it represents the beginning

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.136
of a tradition of telling
African stories in the West:

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.527
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa
as a place of negatives,

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.794
of difference, of darkness,

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:29.136
of people who, in the words
of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.101
are "half devil, half child."

00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:35.136
And so, I began to realize
that my American roommate

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.136
must have throughout her life

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.136
seen and heard different versions
of this single story,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.136
as had a professor,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.926
who once told me that my novel
was not "authentically African."

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:49.720
Now, I was quite willing to contend

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:52.839
that there were a number of things
wrong with the novel,

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:56.136
that it had failed in a number of places,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.399
but I had not quite imagined
that it had failed

00:07:58.423 --> 00:08:01.136
at achieving something
called African authenticity.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.866
In fact, I did not know
what African authenticity was.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.556
The professor told me that my characters
were too much like him,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.556
an educated and middle-class man.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.682
My characters drove cars.

00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:17.136
They were not starving.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.087
Therefore they were not
authentically African.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.136
But I must quickly add
that I too am just as guilty

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.230
in the question of the single story.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.151
A few years ago,
I visited Mexico from the U.S.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.827
The political climate in the U.S.
at the time was tense,

00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.136
and there were debates going on
about immigration.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.136
And, as often happens in America,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.136
immigration became
synonymous with Mexicans.

00:08:42.858 --> 00:08:44.791
There were endless stories of Mexicans

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:48.136
as people who were
fleecing the healthcare system,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.136
sneaking across the border,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.625
being arrested at the border,
that sort of thing.

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:58.136
I remember walking around
on my first day in Guadalajara,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.136
watching the people going to work,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.136
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.133
smoking, laughing.

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:08.136
I remember first feeling slight surprise.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.136
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.

00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:16.136
I realized that I had been so immersed
in the media coverage of Mexicans

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
that they had become one thing in my mind,

00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:20.009
the abject immigrant.

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:23.351
I had bought into
the single story of Mexicans

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.882
and I could not have
been more ashamed of myself.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:28.778
So that is how to create a single story,

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:31.136
show a people as one thing,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.136
as only one thing,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.136
over and over again,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.675
and that is what they become.

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:40.399
It is impossible to talk
about the single story

00:09:40.423 --> 00:09:42.112
without talking about power.

00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:45.404
There is a word, an Igbo word,

00:09:45.428 --> 00:09:49.079
that I think about whenever I think about
the power structures of the world,

00:09:49.103 --> 00:09:50.293
and it is "nkali."

00:09:50.492 --> 00:09:55.136
It's a noun that loosely translates
to "to be greater than another."

00:09:55.714 --> 00:09:58.642
Like our economic and political worlds,

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:03.136
stories too are defined
by the principle of nkali:

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.136
How they are told, who tells them,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.397
when they're told,
how many stories are told,

00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:10.628
are really dependent on power.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.303
Power is the ability not just to tell
the story of another person,

00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:19.136
but to make it the definitive
story of that person.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.256
The Palestinian poet
Mourid Barghouti writes

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.136
that if you want to dispossess a people,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.136
the simplest way to do it
is to tell their story

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.390
and to start with, "secondly."

00:10:30.644 --> 00:10:34.542
Start the story with the arrows
of the Native Americans,

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:37.136
and not with the arrival of the British,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.137
and you have an entirely different story.

00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:44.593
Start the story with
the failure of the African state,

00:10:44.617 --> 00:10:48.136
and not with the colonial
creation of the African state,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.902
and you have an entirely different story.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.136
I recently spoke at a university

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.945
where a student told me
that it was such a shame

00:10:57.969 --> 00:11:01.088
that Nigerian men were physical abusers

00:11:01.112 --> 00:11:03.056
like the father character in my novel.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.136
I told him that I had just read a novel
called "American Psycho" --

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.136
(Laughter)

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.136
-- and that it was such a shame

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.136
that young Americans
were serial murderers.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.136
(Laughter)

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.136
(Applause)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.136
Now, obviously I said this
in a fit of mild irritation.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.136
(Laughter)

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.351
But it would never have
occurred to me to think

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.136
that just because I had read a novel
in which a character was a serial killer

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.136
that he was somehow
representative of all Americans.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.136
This is not because I am
a better person than that student,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.136
but because of America's cultural
and economic power,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.136
I had many stories of America.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.136
I had read Tyler and Updike
and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.720
I did not have a single story of America.

00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.537
When I learned, some years ago,

00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:01.902
that writers were expected
to have had really unhappy childhoods

00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:04.136
to be successful,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
I began to think about how I could invent
horrible things my parents had done to me.

00:12:08.184 --> 00:12:10.136
(Laughter)

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.136
But the truth is that I had
a very happy childhood,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.136
full of laughter and love,
in a very close-knit family.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.371
But I also had grandfathers
who died in refugee camps.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.136
My cousin Polle died because
he could not get adequate healthcare.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.136
One of my closest friends,
Okoloma, died in a plane crash

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.136
because our fire trucks
did not have water.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.136
I grew up under repressive
military governments

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.136
that devalued education,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.136
so that sometimes, my parents
were not paid their salaries.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.137
And so, as a child, I saw jam
disappear from the breakfast table,

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.658
then margarine disappeared,

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.136
then bread became too expensive,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.031
then milk became rationed.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.817
And most of all, a kind
of normalized political fear

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.523
invaded our lives.

00:12:57.983 --> 00:13:00.120
All of these stories make me who I am.

00:13:00.617 --> 00:13:04.136
But to insist on only
these negative stories

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.136
is to flatten my experience

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.824
and to overlook the many other
stories that formed me.

00:13:11.554 --> 00:13:14.136
The single story creates stereotypes,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.136
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.136
but that they are incomplete.

00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:24.120
They make one story become the only story.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.732
Of course, Africa is a continent
full of catastrophes:

00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:31.136
There are immense ones,
such as the horrific rapes in Congo

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.786
and depressing ones,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.310
such as the fact that 5,000 people apply
for one job vacancy in Nigeria.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.723
But there are other stories
that are not about catastrophe,

00:13:41.747 --> 00:13:45.136
and it is very important, it is just
as important, to talk about them.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.136
I've always felt that it is impossible

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.136
to engage properly
with a place or a person

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.136
without engaging with all of the stories
of that place and that person.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.740
The consequence
of the single story is this:

00:13:57.764 --> 00:13:59.721
It robs people of dignity.

00:14:00.492 --> 00:14:04.136
It makes our recognition
of our equal humanity difficult.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.324
It emphasizes how we are different
rather than how we are similar.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.649
So what if before my Mexican trip,

00:14:11.673 --> 00:14:15.136
I had followed the immigration
debate from both sides,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.136
the U.S. and the Mexican?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.136
What if my mother had told us
that Fide's family was poor

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.136
and hardworking?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.256
What if we had an African
television network

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.136
that broadcast diverse
African stories all over the world?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.491
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe
calls "a balance of stories."

00:14:33.515 --> 00:14:37.491
What if my roommate knew
about my Nigerian publisher,

00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:39.136
Muhtar Bakare,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.208
a remarkable man who left
his job in a bank

00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:44.137
to follow his dream
and start a publishing house?

00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:47.848
Now, the conventional wisdom
was that Nigerians don't read literature.

00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:49.126
He disagreed.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.236
He felt that people
who could read, would read,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.136
if you made literature affordable
and available to them.

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:59.136
Shortly after he published my first novel,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.136
I went to a TV station
in Lagos to do an interview,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.351
and a woman who worked there
as a messenger came up to me and said,

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:08.136
"I really liked your novel.
I didn't like the ending.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.399
Now, you must write a sequel,
and this is what will happen ..."

00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:14.137
(Laughter)

00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:17.137
And she went on to tell me
what to write in the sequel.

00:15:17.724 --> 00:15:20.136
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.136
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
masses of Nigerians,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.163
who were not supposed to be readers.

00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:27.685
She had not only read the book,

00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:29.518
but she had taken ownership of it

00:15:29.542 --> 00:15:32.645
and felt justified in telling me
what to write in the sequel.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.136
Now, what if my roommate knew
about my friend Funmi Iyanda,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.136
a fearless woman who hosts
a TV show in Lagos,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
and is determined to tell the stories
that we prefer to forget?

00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:47.136
What if my roommate knew
about the heart procedure

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.136
that was performed in the Lagos
hospital last week?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.136
What if my roommate knew
about contemporary Nigerian music,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.136
talented people singing
in English and Pidgin,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.136
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.136
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.342
to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.399
What if my roommate knew
about the female lawyer

00:16:08.423 --> 00:16:12.136
who recently went to court in Nigeria
to challenge a ridiculous law

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.136
that required women to get
their husband's consent

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.136
before renewing their passports?

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.136
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.540
full of innovative people making
films despite great technical odds,

00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:27.136
films so popular

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.136
that they really are the best example
of Nigerians consuming what they produce?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.446
What if my roommate knew about
my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.136
who has just started her own business
selling hair extensions?

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.136
Or about the millions of other Nigerians
who start businesses and sometimes fail,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.098
but continue to nurse ambition?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.136
Every time I am home I am confronted

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.136
with the usual sources of irritation
for most Nigerians:

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.604
our failed infrastructure,
our failed government,

00:16:55.628 --> 00:16:57.683
but also by the incredible resilience

00:16:57.707 --> 00:17:01.136
of people who thrive
despite the government,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.421
rather than because of it.

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:06.136
I teach writing workshops
in Lagos every summer,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.136
and it is amazing to me
how many people apply,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.136
how many people are eager to write,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.546
to tell stories.

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:17.458
My Nigerian publisher and I
have just started a non-profit

00:17:17.482 --> 00:17:19.136
called Farafina Trust,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.136
and we have big dreams
of building libraries

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.303
and refurbishing libraries
that already exist

00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:27.136
and providing books for state schools

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.256
that don't have anything
in their libraries,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.661
and also of organizing lots
and lots of workshops,

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.136
in reading and writing,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.359
for all the people who are eager
to tell our many stories.

00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:38.136
Stories matter.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.136
Many stories matter.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.136
Stories have been used
to dispossess and to malign,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.136
but stories can also be used
to empower and to humanize.

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:51.136
Stories can break the dignity of a people,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.863
but stories can also repair
that broken dignity.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.208
The American writer
Alice Walker wrote this

00:17:58.232 --> 00:18:02.136
about her Southern relatives
who had moved to the North.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.136
She introduced them to a book about

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.228
the Southern life
that they had left behind.

00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:11.136
"They sat around,
reading the book themselves,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.688
listening to me read the book,
and a kind of paradise was regained."

00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:20.601
I would like to end with this thought:

00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:23.136
That when we reject the single story,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.136
when we realize that
there is never a single story

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.601
about any place,

00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.136
we regain a kind of paradise.

00:18:30.855 --> 00:18:31.977
Thank you.

00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:35.001
(Applause)
