00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
About a year and a half ago,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
on redefining the way maps work online.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And we really are seeing this in very different terms

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
from the kind of mapping and direction site

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that one is used to.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that's where it comes from.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Mapping is, of course,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
not just about cartography,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
it's also about imagery.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
virtual view at 45 degrees.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
as being a canvas on which

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.260
all sorts of applications can play out,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and map's directions are really just one of them.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
If you click on this, you'll see

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
since we've launched.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
we had an earthquake map that showed

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
before and after pictures from the sky.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
is taking hyper-local blogs in real time

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and mapping those stories, those entries

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to the places that are referred to on the blogs.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
It's wonderful.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.260
So, we see the imagery, of course,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
not stopping at the sky.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
These little green bubbles represent

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
photosynths that users have made.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Everything that's cased in blue

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.260
is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And so, when you fly down --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Applause)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Thank you. When you fly down to the ground,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and you see this kind of panoramic imagery,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
as there is of the three-dimensional city from above,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so if I click on something to get a closer view of it,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
then, the fact that that transition looks as it does,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
is a function of all of that geometry,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
all of that 3D understanding behind this model.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Now, I'll show you a fun app

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and uses photosynth-like processes

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
to connect that imagery to our imagery, so --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
(Laughter)

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and there are lots of photos around here,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and these photos are all taken at different times.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
So this one was taken around five.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So that's the Flickr photo,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that's our imagery.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
(Applause)

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Thank you.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
(Applause)

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
There are several reasons why this is interesting

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and one of them, of course, is time travel.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
this visual representation of the world

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
with things that are coming in from users,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260
but it also is the foundation for augmented reality,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
OK, notice there's now a roof above us.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
We're inside the Pike Place Market.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
so, we're now not only imaging in the street

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
with this camera on tops of cars,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
but we're also imaging inside.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
not only of still images, but also of video.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So this is something that we're now going to try

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
for the first time, live,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and this is really, truly, very frightening.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
OK.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Ringing)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
All right, guys, are you there?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
(Noise)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I'm live. All right. There we go.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.260
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.260
(Applause)

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So they're broadcasting this live.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Because I want to show points of interest.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
No, no. The other way.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I don't want to see you guys yet.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.260
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
OK, never mind.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
over here on top of the image

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
because what that gives you a sense of is the way,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
if you're actually on the spot,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
you can think about this --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
(Laughter)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
We're doing two different --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
OK, I'm hanging up now.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We're doing two different things here.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
One of them is to take that real ...

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.260
(Laughter)

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
(Applause)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
here we're using this for telepresence,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
but you can equally well use this

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
on the spot, for augmented reality.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
When you use it on the spot, it means that

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
you're able to bring all of that metadata

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and information about the world to you.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
from the market.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
All right, and now there's one last TED talk

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that Microsoft has given in the past several years.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
where it's traditional, after a long day at the market,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.260
to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
This is the integration

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
(Applause)

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is the current -- thank you --

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
this is the current time. If we scrub the time,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
then we can see how the sky will look at different times,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and we can get all of this very detailed

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.260
information about different times, different dates:

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
maybe change the date.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
So, this is an astronomically complete

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
representation of the sky

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
integrated right into the Earth.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
All right now, I've overrun my time,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
so I've got to stop.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Thank you all very much.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:08:04.260
(Applause)
