00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.375
Today, I'd like to talk with you

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.696
about something that should be
a totally uncontroversial topic.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.640
But, unfortunately,
it's become incredibly controversial.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.292
This year, if you think about it,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.440
over a billion couples
will have sex with one another.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.360
Couples like this one,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.920
and this one,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.936
and this one,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.160
and, yes,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.816
even this one.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.736
(Laughter)

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.320
And my idea is this --

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.696
all these men and women
should be free to decide

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.400
whether they do or do not
want to conceive a child.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.656
And they should be able to use
one of these birth control methods

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.960
to act on their decision.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.416
Now, I think you'd have a hard time

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.800
finding many people
who disagree with this idea.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Over one billion people use birth control
without any hesitation at all.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480
They want the power
to plan their own lives

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.160
and to raise healthier, better educated
and more prosperous families.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.080
But, for an idea that is
so broadly accepted in private,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.240
birth control certainly generates
a lot of opposition in public.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.456
Some people think
when we talk about contraception

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.000
that it's code for abortion,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.760
which it's not.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.616
Some people -- let's be honest --

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.920
they're uncomfortable with the topic
because it's about sex.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.576
Some people worry

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.960
that the real goal of family planning
is to control populations.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.056
These are all side issues

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.856
that have attached themselves
to this core idea that men and women

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.600
should be able to decide
when they want to have a child.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.336
And as a result, birth control has
almost completely and totally disappeared

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.960
from the global health agenda.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.016
The victims of this paralysis
are the people of sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.240
and South Asia.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.936
Here in Germany, the proportion of people
that use contraception

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.696
is about 66 percent.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.840
That's about what you'd expect.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.880
In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.960
Thailand, 64 percent.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.296
But let's compare that to other places,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.016
like Uttar Pradesh,
one of the largest states in India.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.816
In fact, if Uttar Pradesh
was its own country,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.320
it would be the fifth largest
country in the world.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.880
Their contraception rate -- 29 percent.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.360
Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa, 10 percent.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.560
Chad, 2 percent.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.296
Let's just take one country
in Africa, Senegal.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.376
Their rate is about 12 percent.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200
But why is it so low?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.400
One reason is that the most popular
contraceptives are rarely available.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.976
Women in Africa will tell you
over and over again

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.096
that what they prefer today
is an injectable.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.136
They get it in their arm --
and they go about four times a year,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.216
they have to get it every three months --
to get their injection.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.520
The reason women like it so much in Africa
is they can hide it from their husbands,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120
who sometimes want a lot of children.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.296
The problem is every other time
a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.080
that injection is stocked out.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.320
It's stocked out 150 days out of the year.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.776
So can you imagine the situation --

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.696
she walks all this way
to go get her injection.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.896
She leaves her field,
sometimes leaves her children,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.376
and it's not there.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.162
And she doesn't know
when it's going to be available again.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.840
This is the same story
across the continent of Africa today.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.015
And so what we've created as a world
has become a life-and-death crisis.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.720
There are 100,000 women [per year]
who say they don't want to be pregnant

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.960
and they die in childbirth --
100,000 women a year.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.016
There are another 600,000 women [per year]

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.856
who say they didn't want to be pregnant
in the first place,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.976
and they give birth to a baby

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.200
and her baby dies
in that first month of life.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.280
I know everyone wants to save
these mothers and these children.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.136
But somewhere along the way,
we got confused by our own conversation.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.200
And we stopped trying to save these lives.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.520
So if we're going to make
progress on this issue,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.680
we have to be really clear
about what our agenda is.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.736
We're not talking about abortion.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.600
We're not talking
about population control.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.656
What I'm talking about is giving women
the power to save their lives,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.776
to save their children's lives

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.080
and to give their families
the best possible future.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.456
Now, as a world,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.736
there are lots of things we have to do
in the global health community

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.189
if we want to make the world
better in the future --

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.656
things like fight diseases.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.216
So many children today die of diarrhea,
as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.856
They kill literally
millions of children a year.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.976
We also need to help small farmers --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.920
farmers who plow
small plots of land in Africa --

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.416
so that they can grow enough food
to feed their children.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.760
And we have to make sure that
children are educated around the world.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.856
But one of the simplest
and most transformative things we can do

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.736
is to give everybody access
to birth control methods

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.216
that almost all Germans have access to
and all Americans, at some point,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.400
they use these tools during their life.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.616
And I think as long as we're really clear
about what our agenda is,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.256
there's a global movement
waiting to happen

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.160
and ready to get behind
this totally uncontroversial idea.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.296
When I grew up,
I grew up in a Catholic home.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.160
I still consider myself
a practicing Catholic.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.896
My mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.336
My great-aunt was a Dominican nun.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.096
She was a schoolteacher
and a principal her entire life.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.600
In fact, she's the one who taught me
as a young girl how to read.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.960
I was very close to her.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.016
And I went to Catholic schools
for my entire childhood

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.280
until I left home to go to university.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.080
In my high school, Ursuline Academy,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.440
the nuns made service and social justice
a high priority in the school.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.936
Today, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.120
I believe I'm applying the lessons
that I learned in high school.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.536
So, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.680
the nuns also taught us
to question received teachings.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.976
And one of the teachings that we girls
and my peers questioned

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.560
was is birth control really a sin?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.656
Because I think one of the reasons

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.016
we have this huge discomfort
talking about contraception

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.016
is this lingering concern

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.360
that if we separate sex from reproduction,
we're going to promote promiscuity.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.336
And I think that's a reasonable question
to be asked about contraception --

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.160
what is its impact on sexual morality?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.016
But, like most women,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.760
my decision about birth control
had nothing to do with promiscuity.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.816
I had a plan for my future.
I wanted to go to college.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.176
I studied really hard in college,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.936
and I was proud to be one of the very few
female computer science graduates

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.240
at my university.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.136
I wanted to have a career,
so I went on to business school

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.640
and I became one of the youngest
female executives at Microsoft.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.655
I still remember, though,
when I left my parents' home

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.160
to move across the country
to start this new job at Microsoft.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.880
They had sacrificed a lot
to give me five years of higher education.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.216
But they said, as I left home --

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.576
and I literally went down the front steps,
down the porch at home --

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.816
and they said,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.240
"Even though you've had
this great education,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.440
if you decide to get married
and have kids right away,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.760
that's OK by us, too."

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.856
They wanted me to do the thing
that would make me the very happiest.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.816
I was free to decide what that would be.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.000
It was an amazing feeling.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.096
In fact, I did want to have kids --

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.360
but I wanted to have them
when I was ready.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.600
And so now, Bill and I have three.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.720
And when our eldest daughter was born,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.176
we weren't, I would say,
exactly sure how to be great parents.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.160
Maybe some of you know that feeling.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.840
And so we waited a little while
before we had our second child.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.216
And it's no accident
that we have three children

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.480
that are spaced three years apart.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.000
Now, as a mother, what do I want
the very most for my children?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.240
I want them to feel the way I did --

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.720
like they can do anything
they want to do in life.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.176
And so, what has struck me

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.200
as I've travelled the last decade
for the foundation around the world

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.760
is that all women want that same thing.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.976
Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums,
in one called Korogocho --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.560
which literally means when translated,
"standing shoulder to shoulder."

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.416
And I spoke with this women's group
that's pictured here.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.576
And the women talked very openly
about their family life in the slums,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.016
what it was like.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.640
And they talked quite intimately
about what they did for birth control.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.576
Marianne, in the center of the screen
in the red sweater,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.336
she summed up that entire
two-hour conversation

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.680
in a phrase that I will never forget.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.120
She said, "I want to bring
every good thing to this child

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.440
before I have another."

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.696
And I thought -- that's it.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.360
That's universal.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.360
We all want to bring
every good thing to our children.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.800
But what's not universal is our ability
to provide every good thing.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.176
So many women suffer
from domestic violence.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.256
And they can't even
broach the subject of contraception,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.120
even inside their own marriage.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.640
There are many women
who lack basic education.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.360
Even many of the women
who do have knowledge and do have power

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.616
don't have access to contraceptives.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.656
For 250 years, parents around the world

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.440
have been deciding
to have smaller families.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.656
This trend has been steady
for a quarter of a millennium,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.520
across cultures and across geographies,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.800
with the glaring exception
of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.896
The French started bringing down
their family size in the mid-1700s.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.840
And over the next 150 years,
this trend spread all across Europe.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.096
The surprising thing to me,
as I learned this history,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.936
was that it spread not along socioeconomic
lines but around cultural lines.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.816
People who spoke the same language
made that change as a group.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.416
They made the same choice
for their family,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.440
whether they were rich
or whether they were poor.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.136
The reason that trend
toward smaller families spread

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.360
was that this whole way
was driven by an idea --

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.856
the idea that couples
can exercise conscious control

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.800
over how many children they have.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.720
This is a very powerful idea.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.440
It means that parents have
the ability to affect the future,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.160
not just accept it as it is.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.536
In France, the average family size
went down every decade

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.280
for 150 years in a row
until it stabilized.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.280
It took so long back then because
the contraceptives weren't that good.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.216
In Germany, this transition started
in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.880
for family size
to stabilize in this country.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.256
And in Asia and Latin America,
the transition started in the 1960s,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.400
and it happened much faster
because of modern contraception.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.496
I think, as we go through this history,
it's important to pause for a moment

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.576
and to remember why this has become
such a contentious issue.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.256
It's because some family planning programs

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.120
resorted to unfortunate incentives
and coercive policies.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.856
For instance, in the 1960s, India
adopted very specific numeric targets

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.160
and they paid women to accept
having an IUD placed in their bodies.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.096
Now, Indian women were
really smart in this situation.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.616
When they went to get an IUD inserted,
they got paid six rupees.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.840
And so what did they do?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.496
They waited a few hours or a few days,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.720
and they went to another service provider
and had the IUD removed for one rupee.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.280
For decades in the United States,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.480
African-American women
were sterilized without their consent.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.616
The procedure was so common

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.160
it became known as
the Mississippi appendectomy --

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.720
a tragic chapter in my country's history.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.696
And as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.216
women from the Andes region
were given anesthesia

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.160
and they were sterilized
without their knowledge.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.336
The most startling thing about this

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.096
is that these coercive policies
weren't even needed.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.936
They were carried out in places

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.080
where parents already
wanted to lower their family size.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.936
Because in region after region,
again and again,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.880
parents have wanted
to have smaller families.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.896
There's no reason to believe

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.520
that African women
have innately different desires.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.720
Given the option,
they will have fewer children.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.096
The question is:

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.600
will we invest in helping
all women get what they want now?

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.096
Or, are we going to condemn them
to some century-long struggle,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.856
as if this was still revolutionary France

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.680
and the best method
was coitus interruptus?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.120
Empowering parents --
it doesn't need justification.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:51.936
But here's the thing -- our desire
to bring every good thing to our children

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.800
is a force for good throughout the world.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.640
It's what propels societies forward.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.056
In that same slum in Nairobi,
I met a young businesswoman,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.296
and she was making backpacks
out of her home.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.656
She and her young kids
would go to the local jeans factory

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.416
and collect scraps of denim.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.976
She'd create these backpacks
and resell them.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.381
And when I talked with her,
she had three children,

00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:16.981
and I asked her about her family.

00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:19.096
And she said she and her husband decided

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.136
that they wanted to stop
having children after their third one.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.816
And so when I asked her why,
she simply said,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.336
"Well, because I couldn't run
my business if I had another child."

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.599
And she explained the income
that she was getting out of her business

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:35.343
afforded her to be able to give
an education to all three of her children.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.080
She was incredibly optimistic
about her family's future.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.216
This is the same mental calculus

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.416
that hundreds of millions
of men and women have gone through.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.240
And evidence proves
that they have it exactly right.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.736
They are able to give their children
more opportunities

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.040
by exercising control
over when they have them.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.096
In Bangladesh,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.056
there's a district called Matlab.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.816
It's where researchers have collected data
on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.376
In the global health community,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.096
we like to say it's one of the longest
pieces of research that's been running.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.296
We have so many great health statistics.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.856
In one of the studies, what did they do?

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:25.975
Half the villagers
were chosen to get contraceptives.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.176
They got education
and access to contraception.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.376
Twenty years later,
following those villages,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.416
what we learned is that they had a better
quality of life than their neighbors.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.136
The families were healthier.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.296
The women were less likely
to die in childbirth.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.336
Their children were less likely
to die in the first thirty days of life.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.656
The children were better nourished.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.696
The families were also wealthier.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.216
The adult women's wages were higher.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.760
Households had more assets --
things like livestock or land or savings.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.840
Finally, their sons and daughters
had more schooling.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.520
So when you multiply these types
of effects over millions of families,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.240
the product can be large-scale
economic development.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.136
People talk about the Asian
economic miracle of the 1980s --

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.216
but it wasn't really a miracle.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.776
One of the leading causes
of economic growth across that region

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.640
was this cultural trend
towards smaller families.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.016
Sweeping changes start
at the individual family level --

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.480
the family making a decision
about what's best for their children.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.296
When they make that change
and that decision,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.040
those become sweeping
regional and national trends.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.816
When families in sub-Saharan Africa
are given the opportunity

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.200
to make those decisions for themselves,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.056
I think it will help spark
a virtuous cycle of development

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.840
in communities across the continent.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.376
We can help poor families
build a better future.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.096
We can insist that all people
have the opportunity

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.056
to learn about contraceptives

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.360
and have access
to the full variety of methods.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.416
I think the goal here is really clear:

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.320
universal access to birth control
that women want.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.176
And for that to happen, it means that
both rich and poor governments alike

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.720
must make contraception a total priority.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.256
We can do our part,
in this room and globally,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.536
by talking about the hundreds
of millions of families

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.456
that don't have access
to contraception today

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.200
and what it would do to change
their lives if they did have access.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.936
I think if Marianne
and the members of her women's group

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.256
can talk about this openly

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.680
and have this discussion
out amongst themselves and in public,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.680
we can, too.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.760
And we need to start now.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.560
Because like Marianne, we all want
to bring every good thing to our children.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.960
And where is the controversy in that?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.896
Thank you.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.656
(Applause)

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.920
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.856
I have some questions for Melinda.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.176
(Applause ends)

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.160
Thank you for your courage
and everything else.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.496
So, Melinda, in the last few years

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.240
I've heard a lot of smart people
say something to the effect of,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.376
"We don't need to worry
about the population issue anymore.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.896
Family sizes are coming down
naturally all over the world.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.880
We're going to peak
at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.456
Are they wrong?

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.256
Melinda Gates: If you look
at the statistics across Africa,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.496
they are wrong.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.576
And I think we need to look at it,
though, from a different lens.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.776
We need to look at it
from the ground upwards.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.056
I think that's one of the reasons
we got ourselves in so much trouble

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.776
on this issue of contraception.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.181
We looked at it from top down

00:21:08.205 --> 00:21:11.736
and said we want to have different
population numbers over time.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.056
Yes, we care about the planet.
Yes, we need to make the right choices.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.656
But the choices have to be made
at the family level.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.016
And it's only by giving people access
and letting them choose what to do

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.096
that you get those sweeping changes
that we have seen globally --

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.800
except for sub-Saharan Africa and those
places in South Asia and Afghanistan.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.536
CA: Some people on the right in America

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.960
and in many conservative cultures
around the world

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.696
might say something like this:

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.387
"It's all very well to talk about saving
lives and empowering women and so on.

00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:47.371
But, sex is sacred.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.536
What you're proposing
is going to increase the likelihood

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.776
that lots of sex happens outside marriage.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.240
And that is wrong."

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.176
What would you say to them?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.456
MG: I would say
that sex is absolutely sacred.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.576
And it's sacred in Germany,
and it's sacred in the United States,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.696
and it's sacred in France
and so many places around the world.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.616
And the fact that 98 percent of women
in my country who are sexually experienced

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.816
say they use birth control
doesn't make sex any less sacred.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.096
It just means that they're getting
to make choices about their lives.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.416
And I think in that choice,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.336
we're also honoring
the sacredness of the family

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.616
and the sacredness of the mother's life

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.896
and the childrens' lives
by saving their lives.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.200
To me, that's incredibly sacred, too.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.016
CA: So what is your foundation
doing to promote this issue?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.056
And what could people here
and people listening on the web --

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.616
what would you like them to do?

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.783
MG: I would say this --
join the conversation.

00:22:45.807 --> 00:22:49.976
We've listed the website up here.
Join the conversation.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.816
Tell your story about how contraception
has either changed your life

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.856
or somebody's life that you know.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.261
And say that you're for this.

00:22:57.285 --> 00:23:00.000
We need a groundswell
of people saying, "This makes sense.

00:23:00.024 --> 00:23:03.416
We've got to give all women access --
no matter where they live."

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.536
And one of the things
that we're going to do

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.736
is do a large event July 11 in London,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.136
with a whole host of countries,
a whole host of African nations,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.296
to all say we're putting this back
on the global health agenda.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.176
We're going to commit resources to it,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.336
and we're going to do planning
from the bottom up with governments

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.456
to make sure that women are educated --

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.936
so that if they
want the tool, they have it,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.056
and that they have
lots of options available

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.176
either through
their local healthcare worker

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.080
or their local community rural clinic.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.016
CA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some
of those nuns who taught you at school

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.680
are going to see
this TED Talk at some point.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.376
Are they going to be horrified,
or are they cheering you on?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.496
MG: I know they're going
to see the TED Talk

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.656
because they know that I'm doing it
and I plan to send it to them.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.816
And, you know, the nuns who taught me
were incredibly progressive.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.736
I hope that they'll be very proud of me

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.696
for living out what they taught us
about social justice and service.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.616
I have come to feel
incredibly passionate about this issue

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.416
because of what I've seen
in the developing world.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.296
And for me, this topic
has become very close to heart

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.376
because you meet these women
and they are so often voiceless.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.736
And yet they shouldn't be --

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.296
they should have a voice,
they should have access.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.576
And so I hope they'll feel

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.416
that I'm living out
what I've learned from them

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.726
and from the decades of work
that I've already done at the foundation.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.096
CA: So, you and your team brought together
today an amazing group of speakers

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.680
to whom we're all grateful.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.016
Did you learn anything?

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.256
(Laughter)

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.096
MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things.
I have so many follow-up questions.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.376
And I think a lot
of this work is a journey.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.256
You heard the discussion
about the journey through energy,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.616
or the journey through social design,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.560
or the journey in the coming and saying,

00:24:49.584 --> 00:24:51.736
"Why aren't there any women
on this platform?"

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.136
And I think for all of us who work
on these development issues,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.936
you learn by talking to other people.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.816
You learn by doing.
You learn by trying and making mistakes.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.336
And it's the questions you ask.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.736
Sometimes it's the questions you ask
that helps lead to the answer

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.856
the next person
that can help you answer it.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.576
So I have lots of questions
for the panelists from today.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.656
And I thought it was just an amazing day.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.014
CA: Melinda, thank you for inviting
all of us on this journey with you.

00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:17.086
Thank you so much.
MG: Great. Thanks, Chris.
