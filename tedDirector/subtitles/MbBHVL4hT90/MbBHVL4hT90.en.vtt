00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.181
I have a confession to make.

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:19.420
I am addicted to adventure,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.859
and as a young boy,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.367
I would rather look outside the window

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.101
at the birds in the trees and the sky

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.237
than looking at that two-dimensional

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:33.208
chalky blackboard where time stands still

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.953
and even sometimes dies.

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.763
My teachers thought there was something wrong

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:41.150
with me because I wasn't paying attention in class.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.170
They didn't find anything 
specifically wrong with me,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.692
other than being slightly 
dyslexic because I'm a lefty.

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:51.807
But they didn't test for curiosity.

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:54.388
Curiosity, to me,

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.361
is about our connection

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.606
with the world, with the universe.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.496
It's about seeing what's 
around that next coral head

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:03.195
or what's around that next tree,

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.254
and learning more not only about our environment

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:07.324
but about ourselves.

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.854
Now, my dream of dreams,

00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:13.128
I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:15.974
but until we can go there,

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:19.440
I think the oceans still hold

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.879
quite a few secrets.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.243
As a matter of fact,

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.798
if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:29.429
and dissect it into a living space,

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.824
the ocean represents over 3.4 billion

00:01:32.824 --> 00:01:35.311
cubic kilometers of volume, within which

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.821
we've explored less than five percent.

00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.080
And I look at this, and I go, well,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.446
there are tools to go 
deeper, longer and further:

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:50.659
submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.267
But if we're going to explore the final frontier

00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:56.754
on this planet, we need to live there.

00:01:56.754 --> 00:01:59.352
We need to build a log cabin, if you will,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.412
at the bottom of the sea.

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:05.378
And so there was a great curiosity in my soul

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:08.145
when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:09.580
by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.064
Maybe you've heard of her.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.840
Two years ago, she was staked out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.684
at the last undersea marine laboratory

00:02:17.684 --> 00:02:19.667
to try and save it,

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.355
to try and petition

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:23.145
for us not to scrap it

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:25.546
and bring it back on land.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:27.458
We've only had about a dozen or so

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.888
scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:31.800
There's only one left in the world:

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.021
it's nine miles offshore

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:35.355
and 65 feet down.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.010
It's called Aquarius.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.382
Aquarius, in some fashion,

00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:41.631
is a dinosaur,

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:43.971
an ancient robot chained to the bottom,

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:47.391
this Leviathan.

00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.546
In other ways, it's a legacy.

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:52.430
And so with that visit, I realized 
that my time is short

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.681
if I wanted to experience

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.708
what it was like to become an aquanaut.

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:02.194
When we swam towards this after many

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:04.940
moons of torture and two years of preparation,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.909
this habitat waiting to invite us

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.925
was like a new home.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.120
And the point of going down to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.967
and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:21.566
It wasn't about living at something
the size of a school bus.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:24.772
It was about giving us the luxury of time

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.821
outside to wander, to explore,

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:31.704
to understand more about this oceanic final frontier.

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:34.011
We had megafauna come and visit us.

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:37.551
This spotted eagle ray is a fairly
common sight in the oceans.

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.183
But why this is so important,

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:41.758
why this picture is up,

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.223
is because this particular animal
brought his friends around,

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:48.370
and instead of being the
pelagic animals that they were,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.760
they started getting curious about us,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.749
these new strangers that were
moving into the neighborhood,

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.268
doing things with plankton.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:58.970
We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.457
and they got closer and closer to us,

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:03.239
and because of the luxury of time,

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.590
these animals, these residents of the coral reef,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.004
were starting to get used to us,

00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:10.681
and these pelagics that
normal travel through stopped.

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.184
This particular animal actually circled

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:17.335
for 31 full days during our mission.

00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:19.675
So mission 31 wasn't so much

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:21.587
about breaking records.

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:26.021
It was about that human-ocean connection.

00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.175
Because of the luxury of time, we were able

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:32.134
to study animals such as sharks and grouper

00:04:32.134 --> 00:04:34.384
in aggregations that we've never seen before.

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:38.970
It's like seeing dogs and 
cats behaving well together.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.745
Even being able to commune with animals

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:41.872
that are much larger than us,

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.634
such as this endangered goliath grouper

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:47.896
who only still resides in the Florida Keys.

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.205
Of course, just like any neighbor,

00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:52.725
after a while, if they get tired,

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.345
the goliath grouper barks at us,

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.141
and this bark is so powerful

00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.800
that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.769
within a split second.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:02.286
For us, it's just telling us to go back

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:06.918
into the habitat and leave them alone.

00:05:06.918 --> 00:05:10.149
Now, this wasn't just about adventure.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.978
There was actually a serious note to it.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.279
We did a lot of science, and again,
because of the luxury of time,

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.845
we were able to do over three years of science

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:20.306
in 31 days.

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:22.522
In this particular case, we were using a PAM,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.243
or, let me just see if I can get this straight,

00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:28.262
a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:31.465
And our scientists from FIU, MIT,

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:33.520
and from Northeastern

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.493
were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:38.181
when we're not around.

00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.734
The Pulse Amplitude Modulated
Fluorometer, or PAM,

00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:43.240
gauges the fluorescence of corals

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.717
as it pertains to pollutants in the water

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:49.103
as well as climate change-related issues.

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:52.601
We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,

00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:54.930
such as this sonde, or what I like to call

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.084
the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde

00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:03.887
itself tests for metabolism rates

00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:06.987
in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,

00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:09.338
or the redwoods of the [ocean].

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:10.610
And this gives us a much better gauge

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.928
of what's happening underwater

00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:15.863
with regard to climate change-related issues,

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:17.651
and how the dynamics of that

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:20.261
affect us here on land.

00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:22.743
And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.

00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:24.671
And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,

00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:27.168
because as we take away some of the predators

00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:29.339
on these coral reefs around the world,

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.904
the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:34.558
What we realized is

00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:37.741
not only do they stop taking care of the reef,

00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.665
darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.184
and going back into their homes,

00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:43.163
they start spreading out and disappearing

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:45.278
from those particular coral reefs.

00:06:45.278 --> 00:06:47.606
Well, within that 31 days,

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.295
we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers

00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:53.426
on each one of these topics.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:58.132
But the point of adventure is not only to learn,

00:06:58.132 --> 00:07:00.525
it's to be able to share that 
knowledge with the world,

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:04.507
and with that, thanks to a 
couple of engineers at MIT,

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.840
we were able to use a prototype
camera called the Edgertronic

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.901
to capture slow-motion video,

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:13.673
up to 20,000 frames per second

00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:15.052
in a little box

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:16.693
that's worth 3,000 dollars.

00:07:16.693 --> 00:07:18.937
It's available to every one of us.

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.655
And that particular camera gives us an insight

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:24.280
into what fairly common animals do

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.526
but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.836
Let me show you a quick video

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.906
of what this camera does.

00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:33.741
You can see the silky bubble come out

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.920
of our hard hats.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.252
It gives us an insight

00:07:38.252 --> 00:07:40.613
into some of the animals that we were sitting

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:42.571
right next to for 31 days

00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:45.280
and never normally would have paid attention to,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.160
such as hermit crabs.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.175
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:52.300
that's not really meant for the oceans

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.444
is not always easy.

00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:56.992
We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,

00:07:56.992 --> 00:07:59.552
cordon it back to the lab,

00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:02.073
and actually man the trigger

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:04.247
from the lab itself.

00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:06.441
But what this gives us

00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:09.275
is the foresight to look at and analyze

00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:12.482
in scientific and engineering terms

00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:15.646
some of the most amazing behavior

00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:16.901
that the human eye just can't pick up,

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.950
such as this manta shrimp

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.718
trying to catch its prey,

00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:27.217
within about .3 seconds.

00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:30.312
That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:31.657
and if you ever try to catch a bullet

00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:35.675
in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.

00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:36.978
But now we can see things

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:39.648
such as these Christmas tree worms

00:08:39.648 --> 00:08:42.809
pulling in and fanning out

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.845
in a way that the eye just can't capture,

00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:47.219
or in this case,

00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:54.280
a fish throwing up grains of sand.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.670
This is an actual sailfin goby,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.186
and if you look at it in real time,

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:02.191
it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.362
because it's so quick.

00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:07.634
One of the most precious gifts
that we had underwater

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.974
is that we had WiFi,

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.190
and for 31 days straight we were able to connect

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.903
with the world in real time 
from the bottom of the sea

00:09:14.903 --> 00:09:16.735
and share all of these experiences.

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:18.160
Quite literally right there

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.306
I am Skyping in the classroom

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:21.324
with one of the six continents

00:09:21.324 --> 00:09:24.280
and some of the 70,000 
students that we connected

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.070
every single day to some of these experiences.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.333
As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.977
with my smartphone from underwater

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:34.508
of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:39.532
We had never seen that before.

00:09:39.532 --> 00:09:41.349
And I dream of the day

00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:43.844
that we have underwater cities,

00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:46.409
and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:48.343
of adventure and knowledge,

00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:51.584
and we share that knowledge with others out there,

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:54.731
we can solve all sorts of problems.

00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:56.189
My grandfather used to say,

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:59.142
"People protect what they love."

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:01.741
My father, "How can people protect

00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:06.665
what they don't understand?"

00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:10.706
And I've thought about this my whole life.

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:14.014
Nothing is impossible.

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:17.197
We need to dream, we need to be creative,

00:10:17.197 --> 00:10:19.570
and we all need to have an adventure

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.221
in order to create miracles in the darkest of times.

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:25.858
And whether it's about climate change

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:28.355
or eradicating poverty

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:29.998
or giving back to future generations

00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:32.596
what we've taken for granted,

00:10:32.596 --> 00:10:34.610
it's about adventure.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.298
And who knows, maybe
there will be underwater cities,

00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:38.380
and maybe some of you

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.988
will become the future aquanauts.

00:10:40.988 --> 00:10:42.866
Thank you very much.

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:46.717
(Applause)
