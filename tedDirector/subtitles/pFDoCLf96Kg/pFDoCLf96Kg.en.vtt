00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So I begin with an advertisement

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
inspired by George Orwell

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that Apple ran in 1984.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
(Video) Big Brother: We are one people

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
with one will, one resolve,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
one cause.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and we will fight them with their own confusion.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
We shall prevail.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Narrator: On January 24th,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And you'll see why 1984

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
won't be like "1984."

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
remains very powerful even today.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Technology created by innovative companies

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
will set us all free.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Fast-forward more than two decades:

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Apple launches the iPhone in China

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and censors the Dalai Lama out

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
along with several other politically sensitive applications

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
at the request of the Chinese government

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
for its Chinese app store.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
The American political cartoonist

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Mark Fiore

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
also had his satire application

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
censored in the United States

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
because some of Apple's staff

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
His app wasn't reinstated

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
until he won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
had its app censored

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
because the Apple nannies deemed it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to be a little bit too racy for their users,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and despite the fact that this magazine

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
is perfectly legal for sale

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
on newsstands throughout Germany.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And more controversially, recently,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Apple censored a Palestinian protest app

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
after the Israeli government voiced concerns

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that it might be used to organize violent attacks.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
So here's the thing.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
We have a situation where private companies

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
are applying censorship standards

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
that are often quite arbitrary

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and generally more narrow

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
than the free speech constitutional standards

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that we have in democracies.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Or they're responding to censorship requests

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
by authoritarian regimes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that do not reflect consent of the governed.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Or they're responding to requests and concerns

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
by governments that have no jurisdiction

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
over many, or most, of the users and viewers

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
who are interacting with the content in question.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So here's the situation.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
In a pre-Internet world,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
sovereignty over our physical freedoms,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
or lack thereof,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
was controlled almost entirely

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
by nation-states.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
But now we have this new layer

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
of private sovereignty

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
in cyberspace.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And their decisions about software coding,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
engineering, design, terms of service

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
all act as a kind of law

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And their sovereignties,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
cross-cutting, globally interlinked,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
can in some ways

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
challenge the sovereignties of nation-states

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
in very exciting ways,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
but sometimes also act

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
to project and extend it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
at a time when control

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
over what people can and cannot do

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
with information

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
has more effect than ever

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
on the exercise of power

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in our physical world.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
After all, even the leader of the free world

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
if he wants to get reelected next year.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And these platforms

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
were certainly very helpful

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to activists in Tunisia and Egypt

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
this past spring and beyond.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
As Wael Ghonim,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
secret-Facebook-activist by night,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
famously said to CNN

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
after Mubarak stepped down,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
"If you want to liberate a society,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
just give them the Internet."

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
But overthrowing a government is one thing

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and building a stable democracy

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
is a bit more complicated.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
who was part of the storming

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
of the Egyptian state security offices in March.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And many of the agents

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
shredded as many of the documents as they could

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and left them behind in piles.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But some of the files were left behind intact,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and activists, some of them,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
found their own surveillance dossiers

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
full of transcripts of their email exchanges,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
their cellphone text message exchanges,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
even Skype conversations.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And one activist actually found

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
a contract from a Western company

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
for the sale of surveillance technology

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
to the Egyptian security forces.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And Egyptian activists are assuming

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
that these technologies for surveillance

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
are still being used

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
by the transitional authorities running the networks there.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
not nearly as extensively

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
as under President Ben Ali.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
But you'll see here a blocked page

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
of what happens when you try to reach

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
certain Facebook pages and some other websites

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that the transitional authorities

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
have determined might incite violence.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
In protest over this,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
blogger Slim Amamou,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
who had been jailed under Ben Ali

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and then became part of the transitional government

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
after the revolution,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
he resigned in protest from the cabinet.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
about how to handle this kind of problem.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
In fact, on Twitter,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
who said, "Well actually,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
we do want democracy and free expression,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
But the problem is,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and how do you make sure

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
that they do not abuse their power?

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
As Riadh Guerfali,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
remarked over this incident,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
"Before, things were simple:

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Today, things are a lot more subtle."

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
The reality is

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
that even in democratic societies today,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
we do not have good answers

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
for how you balance the need

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
for security and law enforcement on one hand

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and protection of civil liberties

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and free speech on the other

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
in our digital networks.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
In fact, in the United States,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
whatever you may think of Julian Assange,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
even people who are not necessarily big fans of his

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
are very concerned about the way

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
despite the fact

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
that Wikileaks had not been charged,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
let alone convicted,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
of any crime.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
So we assume

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that the Internet is a border-busting technology.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This is a map of social networks worldwide,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
which is either a good or a bad thing,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
depending on how you like

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the way Facebook manages its service.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
But borders do persist

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
in some parts of cyberspace.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
In Brazil and Japan,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But if you look at China, Vietnam

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and a number of the former Soviet states,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
what's happening there is more troubling.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
You have a situation

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
where the relationship between government

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and local social networking companies

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
is creating a situation

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
where, effectively,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the empowering potential of these platforms

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
is being constrained

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
because of these relationships

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
between companies and government.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Now in China,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
that blocks Facebook

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and Twitter and now Google+

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
and many of the other overseas websites.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
But that's only half of the story.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
The other part of the story

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
are requirements that the Chinese government places

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
known as a system of self-discipline.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
of their users.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
where the Internet Society of China presented awards

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
to the top 20 Chinese companies

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that are best at exercising self-discipline --

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
i.e. policing their content.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
China's dominant search engine,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
was one of the recipients.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and directly censor websites.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
But this is a website called Rospil

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that's an anti-corruption site.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And earlier this year,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
there was a troubling incident

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
where people who had made donations to Rospil

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
through a payments processing system

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
called Yandex Money

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
suddenly received threatening phone calls

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
from members of a nationalist party

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
who had obtained details

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
about donors to Rospil

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
through members of the security services

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
who had somehow obtained this information

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
from people at Yandex Money.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
This has a chilling effect

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
on people's ability to use the Internet

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to hold government accountable.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So we have a situation in the world today

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
where in more and more countries

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
the relationship between citizens and governments

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
is mediated through the Internet,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
which is comprised primarily

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.260
of privately owned and operated services.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
So the important question, I think,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
is not this debate over whether the Internet

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Of course, it's going to empower

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
whoever is most skilled at using the technology

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and best understands the Internet

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
in comparison with whoever their adversary is.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
The most urgent question we need to be asking today

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
is how do we make sure

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
that the Internet evolves

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
in a citizen-centric manner.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Because I think all of you will agree

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
that the only legitimate purpose of government

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
is to serve citizens,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and I would argue

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that the only legitimate purpose of technology

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
is to improve our lives,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260
not to manipulate or enslave us.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So the question is,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
we know how to hold government accountable.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
We don't necessarily always do it very well,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
but we have a sense of what the models are,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
politically and institutionally, to do that.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
accountable to the public interest

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
when most CEO's argue

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that their main obligation

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
is to maximize shareholder profit?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And government regulation

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
often isn't helping all that much.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
You have situations, for instance, in France

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
where president Sarkozy

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
tells the CEO's of Internet companies,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
"We're the only legitimate representatives

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
of the public interest."

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
But then he goes and champions laws

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
like the infamous "three-strikes" law

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that would disconnect citizens from the Internet

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
for file sharing,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
on Freedom of Expression

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
as being a disproportionate violation

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
of citizens' right to communications,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and has raised questions amongst civil society groups

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
about whether

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
some political representatives

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
are more interested in preserving

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
the interests of the entertainment industry

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And here in the United Kingdom

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
there's also concern over

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
a law called the Digital Economy Act

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
that's placing more onus

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
on private intermediaries

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
to police citizen behavior.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So what we need to recognize

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
is that if we want to have

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
a citizen-centric Internet in the future,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
we need a broader and more sustained

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Internet freedom movement.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
as a matter of course,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
just because executives woke up one day

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and decided it was the right thing to do.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
It was the result of decades of sustained activism,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
shareholder advocacy

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and consumer advocacy.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Similarly, governments don't enact

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
intelligent environmental and labor laws

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
just because politicians wake up one day.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
political activism

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that you get the right regulations,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and that you get the right corporate behavior.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
We need to make the same approach

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
with the Internet.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
We also are going to need

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
political innovation.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Eight hundred years ago, approximately,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
the barons of England decided

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
that the Divine Right of Kings

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
was no longer working for them so well,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and they forced King John

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
to sign the Magna Carta,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
which recognized

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
that even the king

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
who claimed to have divine rule

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
still had to abide by a basic set of rules.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
This set off a cycle

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
of what we can call political innovation,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
which was implemented for the first time

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
by that radical revolutionary government

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
in America across the pond.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
So now we need to figure out

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
how to build consent of the networked.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And what does that look like?

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
At the moment, we still don't know.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
But it's going to require innovation

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
that's not only going to need

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
to focus on politics,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
on geopolitics,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
but it's also going to need

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
to deal with questions

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
of business management, investor behavior,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
consumer choice

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and even software design and engineering.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
in building the kind of world

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
in which government and technology

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
serve the world's people and not the other way around.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Thank you very much.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.260
(Applause)
