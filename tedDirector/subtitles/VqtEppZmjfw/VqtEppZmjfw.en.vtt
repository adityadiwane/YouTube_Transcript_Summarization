00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:18.215
The great texts of the ancient world

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.530
don't survive to us in their original form.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.049
They survive because medieval scribes copied them

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:27.048
and copied them and copied them.

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:29.698
And so it is with Archimedes,

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:31.464
the great Greek mathematician.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.466
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.164
we know about because of just three books,

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:39.080
and they're called A, B and C.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.913
And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.716
And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:52.548
about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:56.845
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906,

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.394
and it landed on my desk in Baltimore

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:03.520
on the 19th of January, 1999.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.938
And this is Codex C here.

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:11.107
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:12.557
It's buried treasure.

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:14.892
Because this book is actually a prayer book.

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:17.856
It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:21.473
on the 14th of April, 1229.

00:01:21.473 --> 00:01:23.958
And to make his prayer book he used parchment.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.373
But he didn't use new parchment,

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:29.687
he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:31.424
and there were seven of them.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.907
And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:40.374
He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:43.757
He erased all of their texts,

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:46.175
and then he cut the sheets down in the middle,

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:48.419
he shuffled them up,

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:50.337
and he rotated them 90 degrees,

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:52.389
and he wrote prayers on top of these books.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.086
And essentially these seven manuscripts

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:58.434
disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:01.683
The prayer book was discovered by this guy,

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:04.410
Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.851
And with just a magnifying glass,

00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:08.735
he transcribed as much of the text as he could.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:11.917
And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.685
that were unique texts.

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:15.285
They weren't in A and B at all;

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:16.983
they were completely new texts by Archimedes,

00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:20.218
and they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."

00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:22.487
And it became a world famous manuscript.

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:24.302
Now it should be clear by now

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:27.016
that this book is in bad condition.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.486
It got in worse condition in the 20th century

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:32.218
after Heiberg saw it.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.735
Forgeries were painted over it,

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:36.818
and it suffered very badly from mold.

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:40.568
This book is the definition of a write-off.

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:42.302
It's the sort of book

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.967
that you thought would be in an institution.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.153
But it's not in an institution,

00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:51.785
it was bought by a private owner in 1998.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.535
Why did he buy this book?

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:57.072
Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:00.318
He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:04.984
He wanted to make that which was expensive free.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.119
And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.651
Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:15.335
but they should have the chance to do it.

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.634
So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:20.770
and he promised to pay for all the work.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.468
And it was an expensive job,

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.938
but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.103
because these people, they didn't come from money,

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:29.922
they came from Archimedes.

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:31.638
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:33.821
They came from particle physics,

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.387
they came from classical philology,

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:37.355
they came from book conservation,

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:39.937
they came from ancient mathematics,

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.854
they came from data management,

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.771
they came from scientific imaging and program management.

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.327
And they got together to work on this manuscript.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:52.138
The first problem was a conservation problem.

00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:54.571
And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:56.771
There was glue on the spine of the book.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.972
And if you look at this photograph carefully,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.020
the bottom half of this is rather brown.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.388
And that glue is hide glue.

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:03.773
Now if you're a conservator,

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:05.905
you can take off this glue reasonably easily.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:09.270
The top half is Elmer's wood glue.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.387
It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion

00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:14.054
that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.220
And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.571
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes,

00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:22.020
we had to take this book apart.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.871
So it took four years to take apart.

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:28.404
And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:31.175
(Laughter)

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:35.441
Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.676
because this was used in the liturgical services

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.417
of the Greek Orthodox Church

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:40.728
and they'd used candle wax.

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.591
And the candle wax was dirty,

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:43.824
and we couldn't image through the wax.

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:47.159
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.061
It's hard to tell you exactly

00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.775
how bad this condition of this book is,

00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.541
but it came out in little bits very often.

00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:56.891
And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,

00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.891
but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:02.190
So, tiny fragments

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.931
we actually managed to put back in the right place.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.641
Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:12.141
And we imaged the manuscript

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:14.169
in 14 different wavebands of light.

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.075
Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light,

00:05:18.075 --> 00:05:19.291
you see different things.

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:20.858
And here is an image of a page

00:05:20.858 --> 00:05:23.375
imaged in 14 different wavebands of light.

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.508
But none of them worked.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:29.925
So what we did was we processed the images together,

00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:33.225
and we put two images into one blank screen.

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:36.058
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.

00:05:36.058 --> 00:05:37.874
And the image on the left

00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:39.225
is the normal red image.

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:41.137
And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:42.277
And in the image on the right

00:05:42.277 --> 00:05:44.725
you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.

00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:47.707
If you merge them together into one digital canvas,

00:05:47.707 --> 00:05:50.525
the parchment is bright in both images

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:52.400
and it comes out bright.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.416
The prayer book is dark in both images

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.113
and it comes out dark.

00:05:57.113 --> 00:06:00.464
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.864
And it'll come out dark but red,

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:05.131
and then you can start to read it rather clearly.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.973
And that's what it looks like.

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:11.315
Now that's a before and after image,

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:14.297
but you don't read the image on the screen like that.

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:16.916
You zoom in and you zoom in

00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:20.464
and you zoom in and you zoom in,

00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:22.532
and you can just read it now.

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:28.880
(Applause)

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.460
If you process the same two images in a different way,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.030
you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.048
And this is terribly important,

00:06:36.048 --> 00:06:39.031
because the diagrams in the manuscript

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.498
are the unique source for the diagrams

00:06:41.498 --> 00:06:44.315
that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:47.354
And there we are, I can give them to you.

00:06:47.354 --> 00:06:49.698
With this kind of imaging --

00:06:49.698 --> 00:06:52.364
this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging --

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:54.964
we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:56.817
How were we going to do that?

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:58.780
Well we took the manuscript,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.067
and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:06.081
So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left

00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.933
and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.

00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:11.931
And that electron disappears.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.566
And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:18.048
jumps in and takes its place.

00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:19.481
And when it takes its place,

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.315
it sheds electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:23.747
It sheds an X-ray.

00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:26.398
And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength

00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:28.280
to the atom that it hits.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.448
And what we wanted to get

00:07:30.448 --> 00:07:32.181
was the iron.

00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.048
Because the ink was written in iron.

00:07:34.048 --> 00:07:35.731
And if we can map

00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:38.315
where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:40.381
we can map all the iron on the page,

00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:42.980
then theoretically we can read the image.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.315
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.

00:07:47.315 --> 00:07:50.689
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:52.131
in California,

00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:53.699
which is a particle accelerator.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.431
Electrons go around one way,

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.048
positrons go around the other.

00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.364
They meet in the middle,

00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:00.800
and they create subatomic particles

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.030
like the charm quark and the tau lepton.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.052
Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:09.600
But as the electrons go round at the speed of light,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.867
they shed X-rays.

00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:13.517
And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.

00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:15.466
This is called synchrotron radiation,

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:17.284
and it's normally used to look at things

00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:18.951
like proteins and that sort of thing.

00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:22.948
But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,

00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:25.817
so that we could read the page from before and after.

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:28.115
And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.

00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:31.563
It took about 17 minutes to do a single page.

00:08:31.563 --> 00:08:34.218
So what did we discover?

00:08:34.218 --> 00:08:36.400
Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.203
is called "The Stomachion."

00:08:38.203 --> 00:08:40.617
And this didn't exist in Codices A and B.

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:43.036
And we knew that it involved this square.

00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:44.829
And this is a perfect square,

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:46.850
and it's divided into 14 bits.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.633
But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:51.817
And now we think we know.

00:08:51.817 --> 00:08:53.584
He was trying to work out

00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:56.117
how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits

00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:58.444
and still make a perfect square.

00:08:58.444 --> 00:09:01.946
Anyone want to guess the answer?

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:07.308
It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:09.675
And the important point about this

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:13.389
is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:17.153
And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.

00:09:17.153 --> 00:09:20.388
The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript

00:09:20.388 --> 00:09:22.757
is that we looked at the other manuscripts

00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:24.175
that the palimpsester had made,

00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:26.741
the scribe had made his book out of,

00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:29.673
and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:34.041
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.458
He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:40.857
And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together

00:09:40.857 --> 00:09:42.541
decided that they wanted to stand up

00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.541
to the military might of Philip of Macedon.

00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:48.190
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.458
This was a bad idea,

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:52.891
because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,

00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.174
and they lost the battle of Chaeronea.

00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:57.892
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;

00:09:57.892 --> 00:10:00.642
Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:04.242
And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial --

00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:05.390
and it's a great speech:

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.658
"Best of all," he says, "is to win.

00:10:07.658 --> 00:10:09.392
But if you can't win,

00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:11.433
then you should fight for a noble cause,

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.008
because then you'll be remembered.

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:14.606
Consider the Spartans.

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:16.474
They won enumerable victories,

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:18.306
but no one remembers what they are

00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:20.441
because they were all fought for selfish ends.

00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:24.007
The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers

00:10:24.007 --> 00:10:25.723
is the the battle of Thermopylae

00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:27.726
where they were butchered to a man,

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.658
but fought for the freedom of Greece."

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:31.923
It was such a great speech

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:35.658
that the Athenian law courts let him off.

00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:37.724
He lived for another 10 years,

00:10:37.724 --> 00:10:40.375
then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.

00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.959
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:46.390
and no one knows what they did with his body.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.541
So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:51.523
speaking to us, not from the grave,

00:10:51.523 --> 00:10:53.001
because his grave doesn't exist,

00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:54.774
but from the Athenian law courts.

00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:56.423
Now I should say at this point

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.190
that normally when you're looking

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.186
at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,

00:11:01.186 --> 00:11:02.672
you don't find unique texts.

00:11:02.672 --> 00:11:05.774
And to find two in one manuscript is really something.

00:11:05.774 --> 00:11:08.991
To find three is completely weird.

00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:10.672
And we found three.

00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:11.938
Aristotle's "Categories"

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:14.391
is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:18.807
And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,

00:11:18.807 --> 00:11:21.991
possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.

00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.189
Now all this data that we collected,

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:26.724
all the images, all the raw images,

00:11:26.724 --> 00:11:29.074
all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing

00:11:29.074 --> 00:11:32.560
have been put online under a Creative Commons license

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.474
for anyone to use for any commercial purpose.

00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:42.007
(Applause)

00:11:42.007 --> 00:11:45.311
Why did the owner of the manuscript do this?

00:11:45.311 --> 00:11:49.057
He did this because he understands data as well as books.

00:11:49.057 --> 00:11:50.392
Now the thing to do with books,

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.523
if you want to ensure their long-term utility,

00:11:52.523 --> 00:11:54.739
is to hide them away in closets

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:56.539
and let very few people look at them.

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.958
The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.259
is to let it out and have everybody have it

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:05.358
with as little control on that data as possible.

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:06.522
And that's what he did.

00:12:06.522 --> 00:12:09.950
And institutions can learn from this.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.502
Because institutions at the moment

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:15.559
confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.751
And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,

00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:21.222
at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site

00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:23.890
or the University Library of X's site,

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.789
which is about the most boring way

00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:27.566
in which you can deal with digital data.

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:30.559
What you want to do is to aggregate it all together.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:33.656
Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future

00:12:33.656 --> 00:12:35.942
isn't going to be built by institutions.

00:12:35.942 --> 00:12:39.050
It's going to be built by users,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.824
by people who get this data together,

00:12:40.824 --> 00:12:44.359
by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps

00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:45.991
from wherever they come from,

00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:47.791
all sorts of medieval romances

00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:49.340
from wherever they come from,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.123
people who just want to curate their own glorious selection

00:12:53.123 --> 00:12:54.640
of beautiful things.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.257
And that is the future of the Web.

00:12:56.257 --> 00:12:59.440
And it's an attractive and beautiful future,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.042
if only we can make it happen.

00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:04.223
Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,

00:13:04.223 --> 00:13:07.573
and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web

00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:09.256
for people to enjoy --

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.840
all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.723
under a Creative Commons license.

00:13:14.723 --> 00:13:16.241
Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum

00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.789
and it has beautiful manuscripts,

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.807
but the data is fantastic.

00:13:19.807 --> 00:13:21.590
And the result of this

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.608
is that if you do a Google search on images right now

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:27.940
and you type in "Illuminated manuscript Koran" for example,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.357
24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution.

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:37.907
(Applause)

00:13:37.907 --> 00:13:42.940
Now, let's think about this for a minute.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.923
What's in it for the institution?

00:13:44.923 --> 00:13:47.519
There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:49.642
You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,

00:13:49.642 --> 00:13:51.523
but let's talk about selfish things.

00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:55.391
Because what's really in it for the institution is this:

00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:58.447
Now why do people go to the Louvre?

00:13:58.447 --> 00:14:01.431
They go to see the Mona Lisa.

00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:04.490
Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa?

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.872
Because they already know what she looks like.

00:14:06.872 --> 00:14:09.206
And they know what she looks like

00:14:09.206 --> 00:14:13.908
because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.

00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:18.357
Now, there is no need

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.636
for these restrictions at all.

00:14:20.636 --> 00:14:22.723
And I think that institutions should stand up

00:14:22.723 --> 00:14:25.857
and release all their data under unrestricted licenses,

00:14:25.857 --> 00:14:28.073
and it would be a great benefit to everybody.

00:14:28.073 --> 00:14:31.239
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data

00:14:31.239 --> 00:14:33.575
and curate their own collection

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:35.740
of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.828
and increase the beauty and the cultural significance

00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.056
of the Internet.

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:41.573
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:46.006
(Applause)
