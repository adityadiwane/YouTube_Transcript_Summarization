00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.866
I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.068
and I'll explain how
these identities come together.

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.764
It started four years ago,

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:23.420
when a friend and I opened
our first Ramadan fast

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.045
at one of the busiest mosques
in New York City.

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.943
Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps
were swarming the streets.

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:33.548
It was an FBI agent's wet dream.
(Laughter)

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:37.046
But being a part of this community,
we knew how welcoming this space was.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.363
For years, I'd seen photos 
of this space being documented

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.470
as a lifeless and cold monolith,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.181
much like the stereotypical image
painted of the American Muslim experience.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.474
Frustrated by this myopic view,

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:50.876
my friend and I had this crazy idea:

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:53.877
Let's break our fast
at a different mosque in a different state

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:55.302
each night of Ramadan

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.454
and share those stories on a blog.

00:00:57.454 --> 00:00:59.734
We called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,"

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.540
and we drove to all the 50 states

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.905
and shared stories from over 100
vastly different Muslim communities,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:08.234
ranging from the Cambodian refugees
in the L.A. projects

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.426
to the black Sufis living
in the woods of South Carolina.

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.795
What emerged was a beautiful
and complicated portrait of America.

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:16.820
The media coverage
forced local journalists

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.557
to revisit their Muslim communities,

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:22.177
but what was really exciting
was seeing people from around the world

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:25.184
being inspired to take
their own 30-mosque journey.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.001
There were even these two NFL athletes

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.277
who took a sabbatical
from the league to do so.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:32.614
And as 30 Mosques
was blossoming around the world,

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:35.273
I was actually stuck in Pakistan
working on a film.

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:38.894
My codirector, Omar, and I were at 
a breaking point with many of our friends

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:40.559
on how to position the film.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.646
The movie is called "These Birds Walk,"

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.406
and it is about wayward street kids

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:47.242
who are struggling to find
some semblance of family.

00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:50.710
We focus on the complexities
of youth and family discord,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.495
but our friends kept on nudging us
to comment on drones and target killings

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:57.304
to make the film "more relevant,"

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.810
essentially reducing these people
who have entrusted us with their stories

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.777
into sociopolitical symbols.

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:04.553
Of course, we didn't listen to them,

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.973
and instead, we championed
the tender gestures of love

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.295
and headlong flashes of youth.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.374
The agenda behind our cinematic 
immersion was only empathy,

00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:15.958
an emotion that's largely 
deficient from films

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.233
that come from our region of the world.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:23.453
And as "These Birds Walk" played at film 
festivals and theaters internationally,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.943
I finally had my feet
planted at home in New York,

00:02:25.943 --> 00:02:29.505
and with all the extra time
and still no real money,

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:33.190
my wife tasked me to cook more for us.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.577
And whenever I'd go to the local butcher
to purchase some halal meat,

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:37.946
something felt off.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:41.313
For those that don't know,
halal is a term used for meat

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:45.855
that is raised and slaughtered humanely
following very strict Islamic guidelines.

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:49.209
Unfortunately, the majority
of halal meat in America

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.151
doesn't rise to the standard
that my faith calls for.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.852
The more I learned
about these unethical practices,

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:56.900
the more violated I felt,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.092
particularly because businesses
from my own community

00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:03.211
were the ones taking advantage
of my orthodoxy.

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:07.225
So, with emotions running high,
and absolutely no experience in butchery,

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.474
some friends and I opened a meat store

00:03:09.474 --> 00:03:12.034
in the heart of the
East Village fashion district.

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:13.394
(Laughter)

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:15.234
We call it Honest Chops,

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:18.947
and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing
organic, humanely raised animals,

00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:22.668
and by making it accessible and affordable
to working-class families.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.817
There's really nothing like it in America.

00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:28.939
The unbelievable part is actually
that 90 percent of our in-store customers

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.479
are not even Muslim.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.206
For many, it is their first time 
interacting with Islam

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:35.601
on such an intimate level.

00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:40.347
So all these disparate projects --
(Laughter) --

00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:42.522
are the result of a restlessness.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.106
They are a visceral response
to the businesses and curators

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:49.625
who work hard to oversimplify
my beliefs and my community,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.787
and the only way to beat their machine
is to play by different rules.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.976
We must fight with an inventive approach.

00:03:55.976 --> 00:04:00.306
With the trust, with the access,
with the love that only we can bring,

00:04:00.317 --> 00:04:02.777
we must unapologetically
reclaim our beliefs

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:05.419
in every moving image,
in every cut of meat,

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.565
because if we whitewash our stories
for the sake of mass appeal,

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:11.074
not only will we fail,

00:04:11.074 --> 00:04:14.401
but we will be trumped by those
with more money and more resources

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.211
to tell our stories.

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.914
But the call for creative courage
is not for novelty or relevance.

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:25.767
It is simply because our communities
are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:31.840
They demand us to find uncompromising ways
to be acknowledged and respected.

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.358
Thank you.

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.982
(Applause)
