00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.118
So raise your hand if you know someone

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.765
in your immediate family or circle of friends

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.253
who suffers from some form of mental illness.

00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:28.037
Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:30.332
And raise your hand if you think that

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:33.157
basic research on fruit flies has anything to do

00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:37.619
with understanding mental illness in humans.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.412
Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:43.732
I can see I've got my work cut out for me here.

00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:46.320
As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.533
psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.408
take a terrible toll on human suffering.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.621
We know much less about their treatment

00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:59.227
and the understanding of their basic mechanisms

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:01.846
than we do about diseases of the body.

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:04.489
Think about it: In 2013,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.444
the second decade of the millennium,

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:08.809
if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:11.328
and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.256
biopsies and blood tests.

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:18.121
In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.084
you go to your doctor, and what do you get?

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:22.071
A questionnaire.

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.500
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.323
an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:32.210
of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.453
We tend to view them --

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:36.298
and the popular press aids and abets this view --

00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:39.314
as chemical imbalances in the brain,

00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:42.998
as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:47.198
full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:49.525
This view is conditioned by the fact

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.931
that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:57.602
like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:01.578
as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:03.479
But that can't be the answer,

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.716
because these drugs actually don't work all that well.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.892
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:12.549
because of their unpleasant side effects.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.609
These drugs have so many side effects

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.565
because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.254
is a bit like trying to change your engine oil

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:25.367
by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.517
Some of it will dribble into the right place,

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:30.618
but a lot of it will do more harm than good.

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:32.856
Now, an emerging view

00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:35.806
that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.376
is that psychiatric disorders are actually

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.850
disturbances of neural circuits that mediate

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.369
emotion, mood and affect.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.131
When we think about cognition,

00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.707
we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.288
Well it turns out that the computer analogy

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:55.671
is just as valid for emotion.

00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.457
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.

00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:01.740
But we know much less about the circuit basis

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.639
of psychiatric disorders

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.709
because of the overwhelming dominance

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.061
of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:12.888
Now, it's not that chemicals are not important

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:14.425
in psychiatric disorders.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:18.397
It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:22.046
Rather, they're released in very specific locations

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.771
and they act on specific synapses

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:28.459
to change the flow of information in the brain.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.896
So if we ever really want to understand

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:33.601
the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.633
we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.367
where these chemicals act.

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:41.846
Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.803
and suffering the consequences.

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.862
Now to begin to overcome our ignorance

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:51.396
of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:54.076
it's helpful to work on what we biologists call

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:55.655
"model organisms,"

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:58.989
animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.414
in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:06.039
to molecularly identify and pinpoint

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.602
specific classes of neurons,

00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:10.505
as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:12.966
Moreover, once we can do that,

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:15.715
we can actually activate specific neurons

00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:19.926
or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.640
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.105
and we find that a behavior is blocked,

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:27.319
we can conclude that those neurons

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.283
are necessary for that behavior.

00:04:30.283 --> 00:04:32.665
On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons

00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:35.479
and we find that that produces the behavior,

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.553
we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:42.562
So in this way, by doing this kind of test,

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:46.085
we can draw cause and effect relationships

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.441
between the activity of specific neurons

00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:51.354
in particular circuits and particular behaviors,

00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:53.791
something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:58.842
to do right now in humans.

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:01.679
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.879
it's a great model organism

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.417
because it's got a small brain,

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.204
it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:13.354
it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.149
But can an organism like this

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.992
teach us anything about emotion-like states?

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:22.292
Do these organisms even have emotion-like states,

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:25.655
or are they just little digital robots?

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:28.855
Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion

00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:31.405
and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:36.598
in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.

00:05:36.598 --> 00:05:40.117
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:43.531
Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:47.054
here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:50.651
to study the connection between genes and behavior.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.258
Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.

00:05:54.258 --> 00:05:58.692
He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.080
and Seymour taught me both to love flies

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.129
and also to play with science.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.245
So how do we ask this question?

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:11.305
It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.468
but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?

00:06:14.468 --> 00:06:18.418
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,

00:06:18.418 --> 00:06:22.323
as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:26.043
However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:29.356
(Laughter)

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:32.493
It's kind of like landing on Mars

00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:35.198
and looking out the window of your spaceship

00:06:35.198 --> 00:06:37.668
at all the little green men who are surrounding it

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:40.074
and trying to figure out, "How do I find out

00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:42.429
if they have emotions or not?"

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:45.972
What can we do? It's not so easy.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:48.157
Well, one of the ways that we can start

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:52.282
is to try to come up with some general characteristics

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:56.030
or properties of emotion-like states

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.494
such as arousal, and see if we can identify

00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:04.870
any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.690
So three important ones that I can think of

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.362
are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.

00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:14.696
Persistence means long-lasting.

00:07:14.696 --> 00:07:18.657
We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion

00:07:18.657 --> 00:07:23.673
causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.

00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:26.763
Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.

00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:31.346
You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:33.946
If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:35.633
turn down and you sniffle,

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:38.771
and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.603
and you might sob.

00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:44.982
Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.

00:07:44.982 --> 00:07:49.434
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.885
the kind of behavior that you see

00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:54.695
by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:57.380
you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.909
the more vigorously you try to swat it away,

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.193
and it seems to keep getting irritated.

00:08:02.193 --> 00:08:05.840
So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.185
in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies

00:08:10.185 --> 00:08:12.961
in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench

00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:14.686
and blow them away.

00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:17.925
And what we found is that if we gave these flies

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.773
in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,

00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:23.462
they became somewhat hyperactive

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:27.897
and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped

00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:30.761
and took a while to calm down.

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:32.950
So we quantified this behavior

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.962
using custom locomotor tracking software

00:08:35.962 --> 00:08:38.762
developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,

00:08:38.762 --> 00:08:42.374
who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.

00:08:42.374 --> 00:08:45.188
And what this quantification showed us is that,

00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:48.412
upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,

00:08:48.412 --> 00:08:52.726
the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity

00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:55.324
which is persistent, long-lasting,

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:57.828
and also appears to be graded.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.687
More puffs, or more intense puffs,

00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:04.600
make the state last for a longer period of time.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.636
So now we wanted to try to understand something

00:09:06.636 --> 00:09:10.350
about what controls the duration of this state.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.201
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat

00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.256
and our automated tracking software

00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:19.038
to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:24.117
to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.

00:09:24.117 --> 00:09:26.464
And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.

00:09:26.464 --> 00:09:29.257
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone

00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:32.898
and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants

00:09:32.898 --> 00:09:35.070
and screen them in your assay and then find out

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.389
what gene is affected in the mutation.

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:41.901
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant

00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:45.375
that took much longer than normal to calm down

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:47.652
after the air puffs,

00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:51.602
and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,

00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:55.207
it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.

00:09:55.207 --> 00:09:58.218
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,

00:09:58.218 --> 00:10:00.990
and it acts on their brains and on their synapses

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.540
through the same dopamine receptor molecules

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.929
that you and I have.

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:09.415
Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:12.528
including in attention, arousal, reward,

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:15.941
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:19.041
to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,

00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:23.275
Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:26.065
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:29.325
We tend to infer the normal function of something

00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:33.035
by what doesn't happen when we take it away,

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.038
by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:39.051
So when we take away the dopamine receptor

00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.608
and the flies take longer to calm down,

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:45.454
from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine

00:10:45.454 --> 00:10:49.939
is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:52.889
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:56.864
which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.

00:10:56.864 --> 00:11:01.470
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.180
by feeding them cocaine

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.152
after getting the appropriate DEA license

00:11:06.152 --> 00:11:10.152
— oh my God -- (Laughter) —

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:13.324
we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies

00:11:13.324 --> 00:11:16.366
calm down faster than normal flies do,

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:19.565
and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,

00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:21.610
which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.629
that act similarly to cocaine.

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:27.778
So slowly I began to realize that what started out

00:11:27.778 --> 00:11:31.427
as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies

00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:35.403
might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.629
Now, how far does this analogy go?

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:40.751
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD

00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.088
also have learning disabilities.

00:11:43.088 --> 00:11:46.654
Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?

00:11:46.654 --> 00:11:49.374
Remarkably, the answer is yes.

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.002
As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.453
flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,

00:11:54.453 --> 00:11:56.186
are capable of learning.

00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:00.629
You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:03.017
if you pair that odor with a shock.

00:12:03.017 --> 00:12:06.401
Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose

00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:09.555
between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:13.755
it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:17.257
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,

00:12:17.257 --> 00:12:19.722
they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.

00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:23.533
They flunk out of CalTech.

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:28.281
So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:31.331
or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,

00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:36.843
that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.

00:12:36.843 --> 00:12:41.206
Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?

00:12:41.206 --> 00:12:45.119
In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:47.025
causes the learning disability.

00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:50.744
The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.

00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:54.040
But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.912
that cause the hyperactivity.

00:12:55.912 --> 00:13:00.382
Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.

00:13:00.382 --> 00:13:03.439
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:05.843
between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,

00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:10.758
but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.

00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:13.100
Now people have been wondering about this for a long time

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.588
in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.672
And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:23.938
of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.

00:13:23.938 --> 00:13:26.400
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.964
and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor

00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:34.199
by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:36.250
back into the fly brain.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.085
But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:43.799
and not in others, and then we test each of these flies

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:47.467
for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.

00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:52.285
Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.

00:13:52.285 --> 00:13:54.948
If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back

00:13:54.948 --> 00:13:57.909
in this elliptical structure called the central complex,

00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:01.986
the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.

00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:04.712
On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure

00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:06.230
called the mushroom body,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.315
the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:11.145
but they're still hyperactive.

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:13.395
What that tells us is that dopamine

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:16.787
is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.

00:14:16.787 --> 00:14:19.949
Rather, it's acting to control two different functions

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:21.583
on two different circuits,

00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:25.487
so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies

00:14:25.487 --> 00:14:29.662
is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions

00:14:29.662 --> 00:14:32.525
in two different regions of the brain.

00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:35.587
Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans

00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:37.963
we don't know, but these kinds of results

00:14:37.963 --> 00:14:41.440
should at least cause us to consider that possibility.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.413
So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever

00:14:45.413 --> 00:14:48.825
that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:52.352
and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders

00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:55.063
just by changing the flavor of the soup.

00:14:55.063 --> 00:14:59.280
What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.988
to try to design a new generation of treatments

00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:06.276
that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:09.614
that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.

00:15:09.614 --> 00:15:12.814
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:14.861
without the unpleasant side effects,

00:15:14.861 --> 00:15:17.607
putting the oil back in our mental engines,

00:15:17.607 --> 00:15:20.791
just where it's needed. Thank you very much.
