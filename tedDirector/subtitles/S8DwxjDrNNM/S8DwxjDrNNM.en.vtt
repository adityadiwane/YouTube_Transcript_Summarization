00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:18.403
The first time I uttered a prayer
was in a glass-stained cathedral.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:21.793
I was kneeling long after
the congregation was on its feet,

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:23.703
dip both hands into holy water,

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.553
trace the trinity across my chest,

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.379
my tiny body drooping 
like a question mark

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.669
all over the wooden pew.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.339
I asked Jesus to fix me,

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.465
and when he did not answer

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:38.141
I befriended silence in the hopes
that my sin would burn

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:39.631
and salve my mouth

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:41.461
would dissolve like sugar on tongue,

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.376
but shame lingered as an aftertaste.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.940
And in an attempt
to reintroduce me to sanctity,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.860
my mother told me of the miracle I was,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
said I could grow up 
to be anything I want.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.066
I decided to

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.227
be a boy.

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:57.217
It was cute.

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:59.007
I had snapback, toothless grin,

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:00.847
used skinned knees as street cred,

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.277
played hide and seek with 
what was left of my goal.

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:04.204
I was it.

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:06.629
The winner to a game 
the other kids couldn't play,

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.809
I was the mystery of an anatomy,

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:10.622
a question asked but not answered,

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:14.918
tightroping between awkward boy
and apologetic girl,

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:19.655
and when I turned 12, the boy phase
wasn't deemed cute anymore.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:25.297
It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed
seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:29.546
who reminded me that my kind of attitude
would never bring a husband home,

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:33.168
that I exist for heterosexual marriage
and child-bearing.

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:36.999
And I swallowed their insults
along with their slurs.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.716
Naturally, I did not
come out of the closet.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.432
The kids at my school opened it
without my permission.

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:44.894
Called me by a name I did not recognize,

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:46.124
said "lesbian,"

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:48.700
but I was more boy than girl,
more Ken than Barbie.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.903
It had nothing to do with hating my body,

00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:53.023
I just love it enough to let it go,

00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:54.409
I treat it like a house,

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.239
and when your house is falling apart,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.223
you do not evacuate,

00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:01.015
you make it comfortable enough
to house all your insides,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.376
you make it pretty enough
to invite guests over,

00:02:03.376 --> 00:02:07.234
you make the floorboards
strong enough to stand on.

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:12.919
My mother fears I have named
myself after fading things.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.939
As she counts the echoes
left behind by Mya Hall,

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.489
Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.700
She fears that I'll die without a whisper,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.763
that I'll turn into "what a shame"
conversations at the bus stop.

00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:26.409
She claims I have turned myself
into a mausoleum,

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.035
that I am a walking casket,

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:31.239
news headlines have turned
my identity into a spectacle,

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.995
Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips
while the brutality of living in this body

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:38.541
becomes an asterisk 
at the bottom of equality pages.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.637
No one ever thinks of us as human

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:43.795
because we are more ghost than flesh,

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:46.494
because people fear that
my gender expression is a trick,

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:48.351
that it exists to be perverse,

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.394
that it ensnares them
without their consent,

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:53.088
that my body is a feast
for their eyes and hands

00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:55.387
and once they have fed off my queer,

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:58.387
they'll regurgitate all the parts
they did not like.

00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:02.747
They'll put me back into the closet,
hang me with all the other skeletons.

00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.162
I will be the best attraction.

00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:08.241
Can you see how easy it is
to talk people into coffins,

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:10.811
to misspell their names on gravestones.

00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.266
And people still wonder why
there are boys rotting,

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.657
they go away
in high school hallways

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:18.559
they are afraid of becoming another
hashtag in a second

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.437
afraid of classroom discussions
becoming like judgment day

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:28.172
and now oncoming traffic is embracing
more transgender children than parents.

00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:30.807
I wonder how long it will be

00:03:30.807 --> 00:03:34.487
before the trans suicide notes
start to feel redundant,

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:38.110
before we realize that our bodies
become lessons about sin

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.153
way before we learn how to love them.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:44.077
Like God didn't save
all this breath and mercy,

00:03:44.077 --> 00:03:47.653
like my blood is not the wine
that washed over Jesus' feet.

00:03:47.653 --> 00:03:51.521
My prayers are now
getting stuck in my throat.

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:55.175
Maybe I am finally fixed,

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.428
maybe I just don't care,

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:02.139
maybe God finally listened to my prayers.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.604
Thank you.

00:04:03.604 --> 00:04:05.708
(Applause)
