00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.536
I feel incredibly lucky

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.416
to be from a country

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.296
that's generally considered
to be the best place in the world

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.760
to be a woman.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.456
In 1975, when I was seven years old,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960
women in Iceland went on a strike.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.616
They did no work that day,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.416
whether they held professional jobs

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.560
or had the work of the home.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.776
They marched into
the center of Reykjavík --

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.375
90 percent of women participated --

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.176
and peacefully and in solidarity

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
asked for equality.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.080
Nothing worked in Iceland that day,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.736
because nothing works
when women are not at work.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.040
(Applause)

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.336
Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.496
to be the first country in the world

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.936
to democratically elect a woman
as their president.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.776
I will never forget this day,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.976
that President Vigdís,
as we know her by her first name,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.376
stepped out on the balcony
of her own home,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.616
a single mom with her daughter
by her side as she had won.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.120
(Applause)

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.696
This woman was an incredible role model

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.056
for me and everyone
growing up at that time,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.280
including boys.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.896
She frequently shares the story
of how a young boy approached her

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.936
after a couple of terms in office

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.856
and asked, "Can boys
really grow up to be president?"

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.016
(Laughter)

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.816
Role models really matter,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.656
but even with such strong role models

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.976
who I am so grateful for,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.856
when I was encouraged
to run for president,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.216
my first reaction was,
"Who am I to run for president?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600
Who am I to be president?"

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.015
It turns out that women

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.600
are less likely
to consider running than men.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.976
So a study done in the US in 2011

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.240
showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.096
but 45 percent of women.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.496
That's gap of 16 percentage points,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.000
and it's the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.296
And it really is a shame,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.336
because I am so convinced that the world
is in real need for women leaders

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.416
and more principle-based leadership

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.640
in general.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.600
So my decision to run

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.136
ultimately came down to the fact

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.360
that I felt

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.640
that I had to do my bit,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.040
even if I had no political experience,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.560
to step up and try to be part
of creating the world

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.376
that will make sense and be sustainable

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.936
for our kids,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.336
and a world where we truly allow
both our boys and girls

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.240
to be all they can be.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.440
And it was the journey of my life.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.880
It was amazing.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.576
The journey started with potentially
as many as 20 candidates.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.016
It boiled down to
nine candidates qualifying,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.280
and ultimately the race
came down to four of us,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.016
three men and me.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.720
(Applause)

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.456
But that's not all the drama yet.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.736
You may think you have drama in the US,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.976
but I can --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.440
(Laughter)

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.056
I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.016
So our sitting president of 20 years

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.696
announced initially
that he was not going to run,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.296
which is probably what gave rise

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.720
to so many candidates considering running.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.096
Then later he changed his mind

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.656
when our prime minister resigned

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.935
following the infamous Panama Papers

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.856
that implicated him and his family.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.936
And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.240
so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.016
A few days later, relations
to his wife and her family's companies

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.240
were also discovered in the Panama Papers,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.640
and so he withdrew from the race again.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.296
Before doing so, he said he was doing that

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.440
because now there were two qualified men

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.880
who he felt could fill his shoes
running for office.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.456
So on May 9, 45 days before election day,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.680
it was not looking too good for me.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.056
I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.056
The polls had me at 1 percent,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.536
but that was still the highest

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.600
that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.176
So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.496
to get my seat at the table

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.976
and access to television,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.416
because the network decided
that they would only include

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.856
those with 2.5 percent
or more in the polls

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.600
in the first TV debate.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.056
I found out on the afternoon
of the first TV debate

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.816
that I would participate
along with the three men,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.256
and I found out on live TV

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.616
that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent
on the day of the first TV debate.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.720
(Applause)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200
So, challenges.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.976
The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.896
had to do with media, muscle and money.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.736
Let's start with media.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.136
There are those who say
gender doesn't matter

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.896
when it comes to media and politics.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.560
I can't say that I agree.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.040
It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.136
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.256
87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.400
whereas I appeared 31 times.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.856
And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.776
I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.600
because in media,
much like everywhere else,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.096
we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.576
and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.736
When I finally got access to TV,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.920
the first question I got was,
"Are you going to quit?"

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.336
And that was a hard one.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.216
But of course, with 1 percent
to 2.5 percent in the polls,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.520
maybe it's understandable.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.856
But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.096
we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.736
so I know firsthand how much this matters

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.056
and why we have to talk about it.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.496
I was the only one
out of the final four candidates

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.816
that never got a front page interview.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.936
I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.080
and out of coverage about the elections.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.976
So I did face this,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.456
but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.176
I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.776
(Applause)

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000
So kudos to them.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.096
But there is another experience
that's very important.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.376
I ran as an independent candidate,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.696
not with any political party
or muscle behind me.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.056
That lack of experience

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.336
and lack of access to resources

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.376
probably came at a cost to our campaign,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.016
but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.280
We ran a positive campaign,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.880
and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.176
It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.280
because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.616
When access to media
proved to be so difficult,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.696
we ran our own media.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.576
I ran live Facebook sessions

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.720
where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.856
And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.936
because we thought
transparency is important

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.480
if you want to establish trust.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.256
And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.280
I became a Snapchatter.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.536
I got young people
to teach me how to do that,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.816
and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.056
And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.096
But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.296
So it's possible to run
a different type of campaign.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.400
But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.816
I am sad that it is that way,
but it's true,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.920
and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.896
This probably was partly due to the fact

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.016
that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.416
And maybe I also had the ambition
to do more with less.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.400
Some would call that very womanly of me.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.216
But even with one third the media,
one third the financial resources,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.776
and only an entrepreneurial team,
but an amazing team,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.976
we managed to surprise everyone
on election night,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.720
when the first numbers came in.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.296
I surprised myself,
as you may see in that photo.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.120
(Laughter)

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.280
So the first numbers,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.816
I came in neck to neck
to the leading candidate.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.240
(Cheers)

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.656
Well, too early,
because I didn't quite pull that,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.176
but I came in second,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.376
and we went a long way
from the one percent,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.376
with nearly a third of the vote,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.416
and we beat the polls
by an unprecedented margin,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.320
or 10 percentage points
above what the last poll came in at.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.656
Some people call me the real winner
of the election because of this,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.880
and there are many people
who encouraged me to run again.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.096
But what really makes me proud

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.776
is to know that I earned

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.496
proportionately higher percentage
support from the young people,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.656
and a lot of people encouraged
my daughter to run in 2040.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.600
(Applause)

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.880
She is 13,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.376
and she had never been on TV before.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.656
And on election day,
I observed her on TV repeatedly,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.016
and she was smart, she was self-confident,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.416
she was sincere, and she was
supportive of her mother.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.616
This was probably
the highlight of my campaign.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.200
(Applause)

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.416
But there was another one.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.976
These are preschool girls out on a walk,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.176
and they found
a poster of me on a bus stop,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.416
and they saw the need to kiss it.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.136
Audience: Aw!

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.640
This picture was really
enough of a win for me.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.560
What we see, we can be.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.336
So screw fear and challenges.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.736
(Applause)

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.016
It matters that women run,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.976
and it's time for women to run for office,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.920
be it the office of the CEO
or the office of the president.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.240
I also managed to put an impression
on your very own "New Yorker."

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.696
I earned a new title,
"A living emoji of sincerity."

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.880
(Cheers)

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.840
It is possibly my proudest title yet,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.576
and the reason is
that women too often get penalized

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.176
for using what I call
their emotional capital,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.096
but I know from experience
that we become so good

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.816
when we do just that.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.400
(Applause)

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.440
And we need more of that.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.696
We celebrated as if we had won
on election night,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.496
because that's how we felt.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.856
So you don't necessarily
have to reach that office.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.616
You just have to go for it,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.696
and you, your family, your friends,
everyone working with you,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.240
if you do it well, you will grow beyond
anything you will experience before.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.480
So we had a good time,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.096
and I learned a lot on this journey,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.856
probably more lessons
than I can share here

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.656
in the time we have today.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.176
But rest assured, it was hard work.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.920
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.376
It took resilience
and perseverance to not quit,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.656
but I learned something
that I knew before on the one percent day,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.696
and that is that you can only be good

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.616
when you are truly, authentically
listening to your own voice

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.320
and working in alignment with that.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.696
As a good sister of mine sometimes says,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.296
you may cheat on your intuition,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.760
but your intuition never cheats on you.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.816
I think it's also very important,
and you all know this,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.416
that on any journey you go on,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.080
it's the team you take along.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.376
It's having people around you
who share your values, your vision,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.440
but are different in every other way.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.416
That's the formula for success for me,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.896
and I am blessed with an amazing husband,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.120
here today,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.816
an incredible family --

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.776
(Applause)

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.016
and great friends,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.416
and we came together
as entrepreneurs in the political arena,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.256
and pulled something off
that everyone said would be impossible.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.456
As a matter of fact,
the leading PR expert told me

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.216
before I made my decision

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.880
that I would do well to get seven percent.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.856
I appreciated his perspective,
because he was probably right,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.056
and he was basing it
on valuable experience.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.416
But on the one percent day,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.560
I decided here to show him
that he was wrong.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.696
It's very important to mention this,
because I did lose a lot of sleep,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.040
and I worked hard,
and so did the people with me.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.536
We can never go the distance
if we forget to take care of ourselves.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.416
And it's two things that I think
are very important in that,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.976
in surrounding yourself with people
and practices that nourish you,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.776
but it's equally important,
maybe even more important,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.536
to have the courage
to get rid of people and practices

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.616
that take away your energy,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.280
including the wonderful bloggers
and commentators.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.176
I took a lot of support
from others in doing this,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.256
and I made the decision to go high
when others went low,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.136
and that's partly how I kept
my energy going throughout all of this.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.336
And when I lost my energy for a moment --

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.656
and I did from time to time,
it wasn't easy --

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.976
I went back to why I decided to run,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.400
and how I had decided to run my own race.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.096
I called it a 4G campaign,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.896
the G's representing the Icelandic words.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.056
And the first one is called "Gagn."

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.336
I ran to do good,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.576
to be of service,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.096
and I wanted servant leadership

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.640
to be at the center of how I worked
and everybody else in the campaign.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.216
Second one is "Gleði," or joy.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.336
I decided to enjoy the journey.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.576
There was a lot to be taken
out of the journey,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.216
no matter if the destination
was reached or not.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.320
And I tried my utmost
to inspire others to do so as well.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.976
Third is "Gagnsæi."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.736
I was open to any questions.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.296
I kept no secrets,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.416
and it was all open,
on Facebook and websites.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.816
Because I think if you're
choosing your president,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.920
you deserve answers to your questions.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.136
Last but not least,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.536
I don't need to explain that in this room,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.456
we ran on the principle of Girlpower.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960
(Cheers)

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.176
I am incredibly glad

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.416
that I had the courage to run,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.496
to risk failure but receive success

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.400
on so many levels.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.936
I can't tell you that it was easy,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.056
but I can tell you,

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.736
and I think my entire team
will agree with me,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.800
that it was worth it.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.816
Thank you.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.536
(Applause)

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.760
Thank you.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.976
Thank you.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.480
(Applause)

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.930
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.690
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.935
PM: I can't let you go
without saying

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.935
that probably everybody in the room
is ready to move to Iceland

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.656
and vote for you.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.736
But of course we probably
can't vote there,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.136
but one thing we can get from Iceland

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.976
and have always gotten is inspiration.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.176
I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.216
when all the Icelandic women walked out,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.816
and that really was a very big factor
in launching the women's movement.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.296
You made a reference to it earlier.
I'd love to bring the picture back up

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.536
and just have us remember what it was like
when a country came to a standstill.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.896
And then what you may not know

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.936
because our American media
did not report it,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.856
the Icelandic women
walked out again on Monday. Right?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.547
HT: Yes, they did.
PM: Can you tell us about that?

00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:20.376
HT: Yes, so 41 years
after the original strike,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.656
we may be the best place
in the world to be a woman,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.016
but our work isn't done.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.656
So at 2:38pm on Monday,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.376
women in Iceland left work,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.296
because that's when
they had earned their day's salary.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.280
(Applause)

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.456
What's really cool about this

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.176
is that young women and men participated

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.376
in greater numbers than before,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.240
because it is time
that we close the pay gap.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.576
PM: So I'm not going to ask
Halla to commit right now

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.856
to what she's doing next,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.256
but I will say that you'd have
a very large volunteer army

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.696
should you decide to do that again.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.976
Thank you Halla.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.416
HT: Thank you all.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.835
(Applause)
