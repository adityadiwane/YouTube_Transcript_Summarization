00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:18.790
I'm going to talk to you about optimism --

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.273
or more precisely, the optimism bias.

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:22.918
It's a cognitive illusion

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.660
that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.395
and 80 percent of us have it.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.129
It's our tendency to overestimate

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.052
our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives

00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:37.160
and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.177
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:41.683
being in a car accident.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.869
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.314
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.476
but we are oblivious to the fact.

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.703
Take marriage for example.

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:56.237
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:59.706
That means that out of five married couples,

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.427
two will end up splitting their assets.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:05.802
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:09.494
they estimate it at zero percent.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.223
And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:17.072
hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.

00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:20.198
So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:22.728
but they are more likely to remarry.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.031
In the words of Samuel Johnson,

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:29.028
"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.990
(Laughter)

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.564
So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:38.829
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.427
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:43.802
And I just want to make it absolutely clear

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.573
that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.385
because he is in fact uniquely talented.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:50.820
(Laughter)

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.427
And I'm not alone.

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:54.902
Out of four British people, three said

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:58.641
that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.

00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:00.392
That's 75 percent.

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:02.450
But only 30 percent said

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.010
that they thought families in general

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.422
are doing better than a few generations ago.

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:09.443
And this is a really important point,

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:11.331
because we're optimistic about ourselves,

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.149
we're optimistic about our kids,

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.937
we're optimistic about our families,

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:18.120
but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.349
and we're somewhat pessimistic

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.228
about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:28.264
But private optimism about our own personal future

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:30.275
remains persistent.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.341
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.373
but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.

00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:41.214
Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.

00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:43.006
So to show you what I mean,

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:45.808
I'm going to do an experiment here with you.

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:49.658
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.552
and I want you to think for each of these abilities

00:02:52.552 --> 00:02:56.945
where you stand relative to the rest of the population.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:00.731
The first one is getting along well with others.

00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:06.383
Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?

00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:10.705
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:14.718
Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:17.428
That's most of us here.

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:22.358
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:24.941
How interesting are you?

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.785
How attractive are you?

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:30.739
How honest are you?

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.739
And finally, how modest are you?

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.427
So most of us put ourselves above average

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.456
on most of these abilities.

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.587
Now this is statistically impossible.

00:03:42.587 --> 00:03:45.816
We can't all be better than everyone else.

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:47.458
(Laughter)

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:50.135
But if we believe we're better than the other guy,

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:54.218
well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:56.816
because we're more social, more interesting.

00:03:56.816 --> 00:03:58.979
And it's a global phenomenon.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.447
The optimism bias has been observed

00:04:01.447 --> 00:04:03.166
in many different countries --

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:06.270
in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.776
in females and males,

00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:09.500
in kids, in the elderly.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.283
It's quite widespread.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:14.783
But the question is, is it good for us?

00:04:14.783 --> 00:04:17.237
So some people say no.

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:19.755
Some people say the secret to happiness

00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:22.508
is low expectations.

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:25.012
I think the logic goes something like this:

00:04:25.012 --> 00:04:27.270
If we don't expect greatness,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.150
if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.248
well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:37.656
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:39.635
and we're pleasantly surprised when they do,

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.416
we will be happy.

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:43.118
So it's a very good theory,

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:46.145
but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:50.760
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.618
people with high expectations always feel better.

00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:58.550
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.580
depends on how we interpret that event.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.630
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.624
studied students with high and low expectations.

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:12.808
And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:15.718
they attribute that success to their own traits.

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:17.914
"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,

00:05:17.914 --> 00:05:20.589
therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.562
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,

00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:26.735
but because the exam just happened to be unfair.

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.018
Next time they will do better.

00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:32.095
People with low expectations do the opposite.

00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:34.927
So when they failed it was because they were dumb,

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:36.427
and when they succeeded

00:05:36.427 --> 00:05:39.744
it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.

00:05:39.744 --> 00:05:42.145
Next time reality would catch up with them.

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.218
So they felt worse.

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:47.458
Number two: Regardless of the outcome,

00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:51.505
the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:54.681
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:56.400
asked students in his university

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.762
to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:03.647
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay

00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:05.635
to get a kiss from a celebrity

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:07.862
if the kiss was delivered immediately,

00:06:07.862 --> 00:06:12.885
in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,

00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:15.318
in one year, in 10 years?

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:18.448
He found that the students were willing to pay the most

00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:20.447
not to get a kiss immediately,

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:23.427
but to get a kiss in three days.

00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:27.674
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.

00:06:27.674 --> 00:06:30.677
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:32.098
no one wants an aging celebrity.

00:06:32.098 --> 00:06:36.887
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.

00:06:36.887 --> 00:06:39.190
So why is that?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.614
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.

00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.564
But if you get the kiss in three days,

00:06:44.564 --> 00:06:48.718
well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:50.587
The students wanted that time

00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:52.968
to imagine where is it going to happen,

00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:54.597
how is it going to happen.

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:56.808
Anticipation made them happy.

00:06:56.808 --> 00:07:00.677
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:02.760
It's a really curious fact,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.177
because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,

00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:09.081
so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,

00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:10.802
but they don't.

00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:13.677
It's not because they really, really like being in the office

00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:15.644
and they can't stand strolling in the park

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.305
or having a lazy brunch.

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:19.441
We know that, because when you ask people

00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:22.145
about their ultimate favorite day of the week,

00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:24.965
surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:27.885
then Friday, then Sunday.

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:29.754
People prefer Friday

00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:33.718
because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,

00:07:33.718 --> 00:07:35.635
all the plans that you have.

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:38.339
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:40.593
is the work week.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:45.470
So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.391
more strolls in the park.

00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:51.298
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.

00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:54.262
In fact, without the optimism bias,

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:57.012
we would all be slightly depressed.

00:07:57.012 --> 00:07:59.279
People with mild depression,

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.258
they don't have a bias when they look into the future.

00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:06.480
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.581
But individuals with severe depression,

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.410
they have a pessimistic bias.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.873
So they tend to expect the future

00:08:12.873 --> 00:08:15.350
to be worse than it ends up being.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.593
So optimism changes subjective reality.

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:22.343
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.

00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:25.585
But it also changes objective reality.

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.312
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:30.380
And that is the third reason

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.560
why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.395
Controlled experiments have shown

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:38.312
that optimism is not only related to success,

00:08:38.312 --> 00:08:40.119
it leads to success.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:44.989
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.

00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:49.464
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.

00:08:49.464 --> 00:08:52.789
If we expect the future to be bright,

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:55.529
stress and anxiety are reduced.

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:59.749
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.

00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:02.760
But the question that was really confusing to me was,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.429
how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:10.447
As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,

00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:13.343
because according to all the theories out there,

00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:17.531
when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.

00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:19.083
But this is not what we find.

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:22.566
We asked people to come into our lab

00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:25.376
in order to try and figure out what was going on.

00:09:25.376 --> 00:09:27.923
We asked them to estimate their likelihood

00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:30.427
of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.

00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:34.802
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?

00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:37.154
And then we told them the average likelihood

00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:40.135
of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.

00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:43.700
So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.635
And then we asked them again,

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:49.510
"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.758
What we wanted to know was

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.427
whether people will take the information that we gave them

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.558
to change their beliefs.

00:09:56.558 --> 00:09:58.927
And indeed they did --

00:09:58.927 --> 00:10:01.508
but mostly when the information we gave them

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:04.339
was better than what they expected.

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:05.700
So for example,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.610
if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.991
is about 50 percent,"

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:13.512
and we said, "Hey, good news.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:16.093
The average likelihood is only 30 percent,"

00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:18.139
the next time around they would say,

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:20.854
"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:23.490
So they learned quickly and efficiently.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.040
But if someone started off saying,

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.443
"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"

00:10:29.443 --> 00:10:32.135
and we said, "Hey, bad news.

00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:35.208
The average likelihood is about 30 percent,"

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:37.266
the next time around they would say,

00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:40.385
"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."

00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:42.075
(Laughter)

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:45.394
So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did --

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.730
but much, much less than when we gave them

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.203
positive information about the future.

00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:53.237
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;

00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:56.310
everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.810
is about 30 percent

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.589
and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:05.220
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.368
What this means is that warning signs such as these

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:12.260
may only have limited impact.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.419
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.

00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:18.302
What I wanted to know was

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:21.162
what was going on inside the human brain

00:11:21.162 --> 00:11:25.256
that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.

00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:26.743
But at the same time,

00:11:26.743 --> 00:11:28.721
when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:32.837
we think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."

00:11:32.837 --> 00:11:34.922
To try and figure that out,

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:37.395
I asked the participants in the experiment

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:39.556
to lie in a brain imaging scanner.

00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:41.083
It looks like this.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:44.114
And using a method called functional MRI,

00:11:44.114 --> 00:11:47.720
we were able to identify regions in the brain

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.537
that were responding to positive information.

00:11:50.537 --> 00:11:54.116
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.

00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:57.904
So if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"

00:11:57.904 --> 00:11:59.760
and we said, "Hey, good news.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.050
Average likelihood is 30 percent,"

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.622
the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.

00:12:05.622 --> 00:12:10.354
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist

00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:12.175
or slightly pessimistic,

00:12:12.175 --> 00:12:14.760
everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.604
was functioning perfectly well,

00:12:16.604 --> 00:12:19.510
whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.154
On the other side of the brain,

00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:25.940
the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.666
And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.681
The more optimistic you were,

00:12:31.681 --> 00:12:34.018
the less likely this region was

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:37.000
to respond to unexpected negative information.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.058
And if your brain is failing

00:12:40.058 --> 00:12:43.283
at integrating bad news about the future,

00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:47.906
you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.

00:12:47.906 --> 00:12:52.875
So we wanted to know, could we change this?

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.318
Could we alter people's optimism bias

00:12:56.318 --> 00:13:00.250
by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.845
And there's a way for us to do that.

00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:05.472
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:09.427
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse

00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:11.546
through the skull of the participant in our study

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:13.791
into their inferior frontal gyrus.

00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:15.718
And by doing that,

00:13:15.718 --> 00:13:18.622
he's interfering with the activity of this brain region

00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:19.837
for about half an hour.

00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:22.758
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.

00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:24.751
(Laughter)

00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:27.905
So let's see what happens.

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:30.002
First of all, I'm going to show you

00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:32.706
the average amount of bias that we see.

00:13:32.706 --> 00:13:35.529
So if I was to test all of you now,

00:13:35.529 --> 00:13:37.323
this is the amount that you would learn

00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:40.443
more from good news relative to bad news.

00:13:40.443 --> 00:13:42.927
Now we interfere with the region

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:47.394
that we found to integrate negative information in this task,

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:50.958
and the optimism bias grew even larger.

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.428
We made people more biased in the way that they process information.

00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:59.325
Then we interfered with the brain region

00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:02.843
that we found to integrate good news in this task,

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:07.314
and the optimism bias disappeared.

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.322
We were quite amazed by these results

00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:11.514
because we were able to eliminate

00:14:11.514 --> 00:14:14.710
a deep-rooted bias in humans.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:19.483
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,

00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:24.585
would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?

00:14:24.585 --> 00:14:29.629
If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:34.229
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,

00:14:34.229 --> 00:14:38.550
which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.635
But there are, of course, pitfalls,

00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.755
and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.

00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:47.301
Take for example this email I recieved

00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:49.995
from a firefighter here in California.

00:14:49.995 --> 00:14:53.299
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters

00:14:53.299 --> 00:14:57.441
often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'

00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.743
even when all of the available information

00:14:59.743 --> 00:15:01.998
was there to make safe decisions."

00:15:01.998 --> 00:15:05.872
This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias

00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:08.064
to try to explain to the firefighters

00:15:08.064 --> 00:15:10.273
why they think the way they do,

00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:17.399
to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:22.518
So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,

00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:26.156
to financial collapse, to faulty planning.

00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:28.294
The British government, for example,

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.968
has acknowledged that the optimism bias

00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:34.255
can make individuals more likely

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:38.281
to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.

00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:42.535
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget

00:15:42.535 --> 00:15:44.646
for the optimism bias.

00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:46.833
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks

00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:49.267
has done the same for his wedding budget.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:52.329
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:55.889
he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:58.306
So what we would really like to do,

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:02.467
is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:05.695
but at the same time remain hopeful,

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:08.539
benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.

00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:11.343
And I believe there's a way for us to do that.

00:16:11.343 --> 00:16:13.403
The key here really is knowledge.

00:16:13.403 --> 00:16:16.714
We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.

00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:20.555
These have to be identified by scientific investigation.

00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:24.739
But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias

00:16:24.739 --> 00:16:26.514
does not shatter the illusion.

00:16:26.514 --> 00:16:28.062
It's like visual illusions,

00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:31.552
in which understanding them does not make them go away.

00:16:31.552 --> 00:16:33.789
And this is good because it means

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.262
we should be able to strike a balance,

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:38.689
to come up with plans and rules

00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:41.472
to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,

00:16:41.472 --> 00:16:44.624
but at the same time remain hopeful.

00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:48.048
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:51.574
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there

00:16:51.574 --> 00:16:53.693
who just does not believe they can fly,

00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:56.052
you certainly never will.

00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:57.883
Because to make any kind of progress,

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.233
we need to be able to imagine a different reality,

00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:03.964
and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:07.498
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin

00:17:07.498 --> 00:17:10.260
who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:15.041
you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.

00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:16.930
But if you're an optimistic penguin

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.726
who believes they can fly,

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:21.389
but then adjusts a parachute to your back

00:17:21.389 --> 00:17:24.406
just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,

00:17:24.406 --> 00:17:26.269
you will soar like an eagle,

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:29.318
even if you're just a penguin.

00:17:29.318 --> 00:17:31.080
Thank you.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.016
(Applause)
