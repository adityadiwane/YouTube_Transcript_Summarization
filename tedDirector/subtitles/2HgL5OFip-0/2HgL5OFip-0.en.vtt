00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But it slightly bores me.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
(Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and why Francis and I found it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what makes me tick now.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
let you in after two years of high school.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or anything like that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And my mother was Irish Catholic,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and going on birdwatching walks with my father.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I guess, you know, he was the big hero.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but what was the essence of life?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And Schrodinger said the essence was information

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and somehow all the information was probably present

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
in some digital form. And there was the big question

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of, how did you copy the information?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So that was the book. And so, from that moment on,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I wanted to be a geneticist --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
understand the gene and, through that, understand life.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Laughter)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I went to Indiana,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And it was at Indiana I got the impression

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
maybe I could become a biochemist,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You can read it in about two hours.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and he talked about DNA.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Most people believed it was proteins.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and he showed this x-ray photograph.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
even though it owed it to probably different molecules

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
carrying different sets of instructions.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and I ended up in Cambridge, England.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So I went to Cambridge,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
because it was really the best place in the world then

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in, you know, chemistry departments.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So the best place for x-ray crystallography

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And there I met Francis Crick.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And within a day, we had decided that

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
he banished the man out on the right,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is a photograph several years later,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
when Bragg had cause to smile.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So we built a three-stranded model.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The people from London came up.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They said it was lousy, and it was.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And so we didn't build any models,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And we kept telling the people in London

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And, in fact, he'd written the people in London:

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Could he see their x-ray photograph?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
But there was ones in the literature.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Laughter)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
(Laughter)

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
between phosphate groups.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
(Laughter)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And so Bragg said, "Build models."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and that they should immediately start building models.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and after she left he would start building models.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and Bragg said, "Build models."

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Well, of course, I wanted to build models.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
in one sense she was a chemist,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
but really she would have been trained --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
She was a crystallographer.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We weren't the best chemists in the room.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I just put them down like they were in the books.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
He said they were wrong.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And we knew we were right.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
From nothing to thing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So we saw how genetic information is carried.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It's the order of the four bases.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And you copy it by going from strand-separating.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
because you didn't have any other scheme.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(Laughter)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
But that's not the way most scientists think.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Most scientists are really rather dull.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So think about it. The next five years,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
there were essentially something like five references

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
to our work in "Nature" -- none.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And so we were left by ourselves,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
what does this genetic information do?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Laughter)

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
so I'm still looking happy.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
(Laughter)

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But there is what we did when we didn't know

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
He was one of the members. The question was:

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
How do you go from a four-letter code

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to the 20-letter code of proteins?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
There's Francis up on the upper right,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
(Laughter)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so I didn't really get happy until 1960,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
because then we found out, basically, you know,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that there are three forms of RNA.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
RNA provides the information for protein.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and it was all over by 1966.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
so what happened since then?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Well, at that time -- I should go back.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
because you couldn't. No use for it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
(Laughter)

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
At least they patented something

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which, you know, could do useful things.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000
but we were still a long ways from, you know,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
which is: How do you nature-nurture?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
turned physicist. And he developed a technique

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
which essentially will let us look at sample DNA

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and, eventually, a million spots along it.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
made by a photolithography by a company in Madison

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And we use their technique.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And you can see on the top

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So the DNA is really badly mucked up,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
whereas if you have a chance of surviving,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the DNA isn't so mucked up.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
you should really look at this technique,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I think it's going to be very, very useful.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So, we started with breast cancer

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
because there's lots of money for it, no government money.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And now I have a sort of vested interest:

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and made a really sort of surprising observation.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
where we've lost a gene or gained another one.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
if we're around here, you know,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
these little losses or gains might not be too bad.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
maybe we'll feel sick.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So the first disease he looked at is autism.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
we began to find genes for autism.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And you can see here, there are a lot of them.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
because they just lost a big piece of DNA.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
We saw one autistic kid,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
to help parents who've had an autistic child,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
or think they may have an autistic child,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and can we spot the difference?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So this same technique should probably look at all.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
It's a wonderful way to find genes.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And so, I'll conclude by saying

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
before we got the picture. But as you can see,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And yet, in the controls there were three.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So what's the meaning of the controls?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
and whether this is one that predisposes --

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and then there's only a sub-segment of the population

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
that's capable of being schizophrenic.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Now, we don't have really any evidence of it,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Now, some people who think they're right-handed

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
(Laughter)

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
there's a relationship.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I thank you.
