00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.555
When I turned 19, I started my career

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.985
as the first female photojournalist

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.180
in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.294
My work as a woman photographer

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.398
was considered a serious insult

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:27.153
to local traditions,

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:29.201
and created a lasting stigma

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.010
for me and my family.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.022
The male-dominated field made my presence

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:38.092
unwelcome by all possible means.

00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:39.810
They made clear that a woman

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.407
must not do a man's job.

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.747
Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:47.210
because of my gender.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.933
The "No" sign was pretty clear.

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.304
Three of my colleagues

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:56.180
went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.156
where the explosion sounds

00:00:58.156 --> 00:01:00.451
were the only thing I could hear.

00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.566
Dust was flying in the air,

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.525
and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.878
I only realized we weren't
there to document the event

00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:12.848
when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.502
and drove away, waving and laughing,

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:20.351
leaving me behind in the open air strike zone.

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.388
For a moment, I felt terrified,

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:27.623
humiliated, and sorry for myself.

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:29.687
My colleagues' action was not

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:32.354
the only death threat I have received,

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:36.392
but it was the most dangerous one.

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:39.407
The perception of women's life in Gaza

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:41.387
is passive.

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:44.747
Until a recent time, a lot of 
women were not allowed

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:47.717
to work or pursue education.

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:50.788
At times of such doubled war including

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:52.970
both social restrictions on women

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.954
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:59.972
women's dark and bright stories were fading away.

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:02.300
To men, women's stories were seen

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.257
as inconsequential.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.329
I started paying closer attention

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.366
to women's lives in Gaza.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:12.065
Because of my gender, I had access

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:16.643
to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:19.077
Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:20.862
there was a healthy dose

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:23.682
of laughter and accomplishments.

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:27.201
In front of a police compound in Gaza City

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:30.240
during the first war in Gaza,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.593
an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:35.740
and break my nose.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.351
For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:42.848
like these lights.

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:46.211
I thought to myself I either got blind

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:49.100
or I was in heaven.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.320
By the time I managed to open my eyes,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.531
I had documented this moment.

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.874
Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:02.043
who spent two decades in Israel,

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:03.936
as his retirement plan,

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.266
he decided to build a four-floor house,

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.563
only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:14.995
the house was flattened to the ground.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:18.544
Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:21.709
and a jacuzzi, a bathtub

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.953
that he got from Tel Aviv.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.750
Mohammed got the bathtub

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.516
on the top of the rubble

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:30.140
and started giving his kids

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.198
an every morning bubble bath.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:37.460
My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.541
but to show the full frame

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.748
of unseen stories of Gazans.

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:46.122
As a Palestinian female photographer,

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:50.830
the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.151
has inspired me to overcome the community taboo

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:59.318
and see a different side of war and its aftermath.

00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:03.390
I became a witness with a choice:

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.170
to run away or stand still.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.408
Thank you.

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:10.979
(Applause)
