00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:17.690
Basking sharks are awesome creatures.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.037
They are just magnificent.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.236
They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.648
They might weigh up to two tons.

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:26.236
Some say up to five tons.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.513
They're the second-largest
fish in the world.

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:31.149
They're also harmless
plankton-feeding animals.

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:36.609
And they are thought to be able to filter
a cubic kilometer of water every hour

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.370
and can feed on 30 kilos
of zoo plankton a day to survive.

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:42.759
They're fantastic creatures.

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:44.140
We're very lucky in Ireland,

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:47.744
we have plenty of basking sharks
and plenty of opportunities to study them.

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:50.066
They were very important
to coastal communities,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.526
going back hundreds of years,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.302
especially around
the Claddaghduff, Connemara region

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:57.924
where subsistence farmers used to sail
out on their hookers and open boats,

00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:00.675
sometimes way offshore
to a place called the Sunfish Bank,

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.476
about 30 miles west of Achill Island,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.793
to kill the basking sharks.

00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:05.989
This is a woodcut from about the 1800s.

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:08.764
They were very important,
for the oil out of their liver.

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:11.250
A third of the basking
shark's size is their liver,

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:13.057
and it's full of oil, gallons of oil.

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.170
That oil was used especially for lighting,

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.367
but also for dressing wounds
and other things.

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.277
In fact, the streetlights in 1742,

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:20.825
of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.236
were lit with sunfish oil.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.650
"Sunfish" is one of the words
for basking sharks.

00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:26.690
So they were incredibly important animals.

00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:30.083
They've been around a long time,
very important to coastal communities.

00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:33.401
Probably the best-documented
basking shark fishery in the world

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:34.937
is that from Achill Island.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.336
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.513
Sharks used to come into the bay,

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:42.538
and the fishermen
would tie a net off the headland,

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.194
string it out, an old Manila net,

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.567
and as the shark came round,
it would hit the net,

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:47.987
the net would collapse on it.

00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:49.706
It would often drown and suffocate.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.585
Or at times, they would row out
in their small curraghs

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.143
and kill it with a lance
through the back of the neck.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.911
And then they'd tow the sharks
back to Purteen Harbour,

00:01:57.935 --> 00:01:59.659
boil them up, use the oil.

00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:03.607
They also used the flesh
as well, for fertilizer

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.527
and also would fin the sharks.

00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:09.392
This is probably the biggest threat
to sharks worldwide --

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.455
the finning of sharks.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.968
We're often frightened
of sharks, thanks to "Jaws."

00:02:13.992 --> 00:02:17.046
Maybe five or six people
get killed by sharks every year.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.245
There was someone recently, wasn't there?
Just a couple weeks ago.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.236
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.236
So I don't know what the balance is,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.254
but I think sharks have more right
to be fearful of us than we have of them.

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:29.907
It was a well-documented fishery.

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.134
As you can see here,
it peaked in the '50s,

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:34.255
where they were killing
1,500 sharks a year.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.213
And it declined very fast --
a classic boom-and-bust fishery,

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:39.909
which suggests that a stock
has been depleted

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:41.871
or there's low reproductive rates.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.365
They killed about 12,000 sharks
within this period,

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.319
literally just by stringing a Manila rope

00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:49.921
off the tip of Keem Bay
up in Achill Island.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.850
Sharks were still killed
up into the mid-80s,

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:55.887
especially out of places
like Dunmore East in County Waterford.

00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:58.740
About two and a half, 3,000
sharks were killed up till '85,

00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:00.458
mainly by Norwegian vessels.

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:01.636
You can't really see,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.199
but these are Norwegian
basking shark hunting vessels.

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:07.778
The black line in the crow's nest
signifies this is a shark vessel,

00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:09.874
rather than a whaling vessel.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.743
The importance of basking sharks
to the coast communities

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.445
is recognized through the language.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.754
I don't pretend
to [know many Irish words],

00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:20.336
but in Kerry they were often
known as "ainmhide Na seolta,"

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.935
"the monster with the sails."

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.365
Another title would be "liop an dá lapa,"

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.299
"the unwieldy beast with two fins."

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.095
"Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.622
Or my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine,"
"the great fish of the sun."

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:36.182
That's a lovely, evocative name.

00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:39.736
On Tory Island -- a strange place
anyway -- they were known as "muldoons."

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.781
(Laughter)

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.000
No one seems to know why.

00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:44.359
Hope there's no one
from Tory here. Lovely place.

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:48.406
But more commonly all around the island,
they were known as the sunfish.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.139
And this represents their habit
of basking on the surface

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:52.321
when the sun is out.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:54.908
There's great concern
that basking sharks are depleted

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:56.445
all throughout the world.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.462
Some say it's not population decline,

00:03:58.486 --> 00:04:00.975
it might be a change
in the distribution of plankton.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.156
It's been suggested

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.404
that these sharks would make
fantastic indicators of climate change,

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.839
as they're basically
continuous plankton recorders,

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:09.683
swimming around with their mouth open.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.992
They're now listed
as vulnerable under the IUCN.

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:14.976
There's movements in Europe
to try and stop catching them.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.456
There's now a ban on catching
and even landing them,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.545
even landing ones caught accidentally.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.157
They're not protected in Ireland;

00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:24.166
in fact, they have no legislative
status in Ireland whatsoever,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.120
despite our importance for the species

00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:29.698
and also the historical context
within which basking sharks reside.

00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:31.236
We know very little about them.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.361
And most of what we do know

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.171
is based on their habit
of coming to the surface --

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:39.597
we try and guess what they're doing
from their behavior on the surface.

00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:42.689
I only found out last year,
at a conference on the Isle of Man,

00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:45.427
just how unusual it is to live somewhere

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.998
where basking sharks regularly,
frequently and predictably

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.566
come to the surface to "bask."

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:54.081
It's a fantastic opportunity
for a scientist

00:04:54.105 --> 00:04:55.906
to see and experience basking sharks.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.279
They are awesome creatures.

00:04:57.303 --> 00:05:00.759
It gives us a fantastic opportunity
to study them, to get access to them.

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:04.181
What we've been doing for a couple
years -- last year was a big year --

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.059
is we started tagging sharks,

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:09.129
so we could try to get some idea
of sight fidelity and movement

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:10.311
and things like that.

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:13.636
So we concentrated mainly
in North Donegal and West Kerry

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.371
as the two areas
where I was mainly active.

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:20.552
And we tagged them
very simply, not very high-tech,

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:21.752
with a big, long pole.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:24.402
This is a beachcaster rod
with a tag on the end.

00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:27.097
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:29.407
And we were very effective.

00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.269
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.

00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:35.944
We got 50 in three days
off Inishowen Peninsula.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.525
Half the challenge to get access

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:39.763
is to be in the right place
at the right time.

00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:43.256
But it's a very simple, easy technique;
I'll show you what it looks like.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.131
We use a pole camera on the boat
to actually film the shark.

00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:48.692
One, it's to try and work out
the gender of the shark.

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:52.379
We also deployed some satellite tags,
so we did use high-tech stuff as well.

00:05:52.403 --> 00:05:53.712
These are archival tags.

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.675
What they do is store the data.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.585
A satellite tag only works
when the air is clear of the water

00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.506
and can send a signal to the satellite.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.985
And sharks and fish
are underwater most of the time,

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.938
so this tag actually works out
the locations of shark,

00:06:05.962 --> 00:06:09.324
depending on the timing
and the setting of the sun,

00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:11.299
plus water temperature and depth.

00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:13.491
And you have to kind of
reconstruct the path.

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:14.688
What happens is,

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:17.802
you set the tag to detach
from the shark after a fixed period --

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:19.224
in this case, eight months --

00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:21.356
and literally to the day,
the tag popped off,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.259
drifted up, said hello to the satellite

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:26.152
and sent, not all the data,
but enough data for us to use.

00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:29.420
This is the only way to really work out
their behavior and movements

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:30.635
when they're underwater.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:33.636
And here's a couple
of maps that we've done.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.816
In that one, you can see
that we tagged both off Kerry.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.325
Basically, it spent all its time,
the last eight months, in Irish waters.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.358
On Christmas, it was out
on the shelf edge.

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:44.326
Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.475
with sea-surface temperature
and water depth,

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.852
but again, the second shark
spent most of its time

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:50.225
in and around the Irish Sea.

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.427
Colleagues from the Isle of Man
last year actually tagged one shark

00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.635
that went from the Isle of Man
to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.982
Nine and a half thousand kilometers --
we never thought that happened.

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:03.930
Another colleague in the States
tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.

00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:05.394
His tags didn't really work.

00:07:05.418 --> 00:07:07.251
All he knows is where he tagged them,

00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:08.743
and where they popped off.

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:11.085
His tags popped off in the Caribbean,

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:12.636
and even in Brazil.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.975
We thought basking sharks
were temperate animals

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.491
and lived in our latitudes,

00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:19.707
but in actual fact, they're obviously
crossing the equator as well.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.493
So very simple things like that,

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.565
we're trying to learn
about basking sharks.

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:28.921
One thing that I think
is a very surprising and strange thing

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.910
is just how low the genetic
diversity of sharks is.

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:35.395
I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend
to understand the genetics.

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:37.776
And that's why it's great
to have collaboration.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.112
Whereas I'm a field person,

00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:40.660
I get panic attacks

00:07:40.684 --> 00:07:43.832
if I have to spend too many hours
in a lab with a white coat on.

00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:45.087
Take me away.

00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.691
So we can work with geneticists
who understand that.

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:50.295
So when they looked at
the genetics of basking sharks,

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.328
they found that the diversity
was incredibly low.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:55.211
If you look at the first line, really,

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:58.691
you can see that all these different
shark species are all quite similar.

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:00.493
I think this means they're all sharks

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:02.447
and they've come from a common ancestry.

00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:04.541
But if you look at nucleotide diversity,

00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:07.785
which is more genetics
that are passed on through the parents,

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:10.642
you see that basking sharks,
if you look at the first study,

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:14.636
was order of magnitude less diverse
even than other shark species.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.732
You can see this work
was only done in 2006.

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:20.393
Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic
variability of basking sharks.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.530
We had no idea: Did they distinguish
into different populations?

00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:24.829
Were there subpopulations?

00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:27.004
And that's very important
if you want to know

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:29.805
what the population size is,
and the status of the animals.

00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:33.440
So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found
this a bit unbelievable, really.

00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:40.049
So he did another study
using microsatellites,

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.684
which is much more expensive,
much more time-consuming,

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:45.969
and to his surprise,
came up with almost identical results.

00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:48.905
So it does seem to be
that basking sharks, for some reason,

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.699
have incredibly low diversity.

00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:53.217
And it's thought maybe
it was a genetic bottleneck,

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.312
thought to have been 12,000 years ago,

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.860
and this has caused a very low diversity.

00:08:57.884 --> 00:08:59.844
And yet, if you look at the whale shark,

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:02.583
which is the other
plankton-eating large shark,

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:04.078
its diversity is much greater.

00:09:04.102 --> 00:09:06.537
So it doesn't really make sense at all.

00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:08.995
They found that there was
no genetic differentiation

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:11.480
between any of the world's oceans
of basking sharks:

00:09:11.504 --> 00:09:13.742
even though they're found
throughout the world,

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:15.924
you couldn't tell
the difference, genetically,

00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:19.381
from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,
New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.

00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:20.984
They all basically seem the same.

00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:23.913
Which, again, is kind of surprising;
you wouldn't expect that.

00:09:23.937 --> 00:09:26.284
I don't understand or pretend
to understand this;

00:09:26.308 --> 00:09:28.218
I suspect most geneticists don't either,

00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:29.636
but they produce the numbers.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.987
So you can actually estimate
the population size

00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.181
based on the diversity of the genetics.

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:37.757
And Rus Hoelzel came up with
an effective population size:

00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:39.614
8,200 animals.

00:09:39.638 --> 00:09:42.542
That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:44.788
You're thinking,
"That's ridiculous. No way."

00:09:44.812 --> 00:09:46.636
So Les did a finer study,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.438
and he found out it came out about 9,000.

00:09:49.462 --> 00:09:52.343
Using different microsatellites
gave the different results,

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:57.008
but the mean of all these
studies is about 5,000,

00:09:57.032 --> 00:09:58.636
which I personally don't believe.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.290
But then, I am a skeptic.

00:10:00.314 --> 00:10:02.743
But even if you toss a few numbers around,

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:06.184
you're probably talking an effective
population of about 20,000 animals.

00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:10.723
Do you remember how many they killed
off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?

00:10:10.747 --> 00:10:12.443
So what it tells us, actually,

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:15.719
is that there's actually a risk
of extinction of this species

00:10:15.743 --> 00:10:17.636
because its population is so small.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.191
In fact, of those 20,000,

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:21.383
8,000 were thought to be females.

00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:24.094
There's only 8,000 basking shark
females in the world?

00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:25.964
I don't know. I don't believe it.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:30.028
The problem with this
is they were constrained with samples.

00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:31.635
They didn't get enough samples

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:35.379
to really explore the genetics
in enough detail.

00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:40.461
So, where do you get samples from
for your genetic analysis?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.718
Well, one obvious source is dead sharks --

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:44.994
dead sharks, washed up.

00:10:45.018 --> 00:10:48.274
We might get two or three dead sharks
washed up in Ireland a year,

00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:49.820
if we're kind of lucky.

00:10:49.844 --> 00:10:52.194
Another source would be
fisheries' bycatch.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.207
We were getting quite a few caught
in surface drift nets.

00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:58.017
That's banned now, and that'll be
good news for the sharks.

00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:59.958
And some are caught in nets, in trawls.

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:03.600
This is a shark that was actually
landed in Howth just before Christmas --

00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:06.651
illegally, because you're not allowed
to do that under EU law --

00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:09.513
and was actually sold
for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.

00:11:09.537 --> 00:11:11.361
They even put a recipe up on the wall,

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.163
until they were told it was illegal.

00:11:13.187 --> 00:11:15.066
They actually did get a fine for that.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.416
So if you look at
all those studies I showed you,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.096
the total number of samples worldwide

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.644
is 86, at present.

00:11:22.118 --> 00:11:24.210
So it's very important work,

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:26.329
and they can ask
some really good questions,

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:30.636
and tell us about population size
and subpopulations and structure,

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.313
but they're constrained
by lack of samples.

00:11:34.004 --> 00:11:35.853
When we were out tagging our sharks --

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:39.187
this is how we tagged them on the front
of a RIB, get in there fast --

00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.377
occasionally, the sharks do react.

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:44.152
On one occasion, when we were
up in Malin Head in Donegal,

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:46.674
the shark smacked the side
of the boat with his tail,

00:11:46.698 --> 00:11:49.842
more, I think, in startle to the fact
that a boat came near it,

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.852
rather than the tag going in.

00:11:52.217 --> 00:11:54.613
And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:59.126
And then when myself and Emmett
got back to Malin Head, to the pier,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.592
I noticed some black slime
on the front of the boat.

00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:04.345
I used to spend a lot of time
on commercial fishing boats,

00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:05.848
and I remember fishermen saying

00:12:05.872 --> 00:12:08.695
they can tell when a basking shark
has been caught in a net,

00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:10.599
because it leaves a black slime behind.

00:12:10.623 --> 00:12:12.454
So that must have come from the shark.

00:12:12.478 --> 00:12:15.872
Now, we had an interest
in getting tissue samples for genetics

00:12:15.896 --> 00:12:17.882
because we knew they were very valuable.

00:12:17.906 --> 00:12:19.563
We would use conventional methods;

00:12:19.587 --> 00:12:21.904
I have a crossbow --
you see it in my hand there,

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:25.414
which we use to sample whales
and dolphins for genetic studies as well.

00:12:25.438 --> 00:12:27.413
So I tried that, I tried many techniques.

00:12:27.437 --> 00:12:29.366
All it was doing was breaking my arrows,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.415
because the shark's skin
is just so strong.

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:34.215
There was no way we were going
to get a sample from that.

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:35.816
That wasn't going to work.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.397
So when I saw the black slime
on the bow of the boat,

00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:41.398
I thought, "If you take
what you're given in this world ..."

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:42.586
So I scraped it off.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.005
I had a little tube with alcohol in it
to send to the geneticists.

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:50.084
So I scraped the slime off
and sent it to Aberdeen,

00:12:50.108 --> 00:12:51.624
and said, "You might try that."

00:12:51.648 --> 00:12:53.258
And they sat on it for months.

00:12:53.282 --> 00:12:56.094
It was only because we had
a conference on the Isle of Man.

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.657
But I kept emailing Les, saying,

00:12:57.681 --> 00:12:59.776
"Have you had a chance
to look at my slime?"

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.643
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later."

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:04.490
He thought he'd better do it
because I never met him before;

00:13:04.514 --> 00:13:07.269
he might lose face if he hadn't done
the thing I sent him.

00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:10.144
And he was amazed that they actually
got DNA from the slime.

00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:12.003
They amplified it and they tested it,

00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:14.825
and they found, yes,
this was actually basking shark DNA,

00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.786
which was got from the slime.

00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:18.993
So he was very excited.

00:13:19.017 --> 00:13:22.302
It became known as "Simon's shark slime."

00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:25.217
And I thought, "Hey, you know,
I can build on this."

00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:29.003
So we thought, OK, we're going to try
to get out and get some slime.

00:13:29.027 --> 00:13:32.661
So having spent three-and-a-half
thousand on satellite tags ...

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:38.684
I then thought I'd invest 7.95 --
the price is still on it --

00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:40.898
in my local hardware store in Kilrush

00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:42.692
for a mop handle,

00:13:42.716 --> 00:13:45.636
and even less money on some oven cleaners.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.131
And I wrapped the oven cleaner
around the edge of the mop handle

00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:50.636
and ...

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.218
(Laughter)

00:13:52.242 --> 00:13:55.773
I was desperate to have an opportunity
to get some sharks.

00:13:55.797 --> 00:14:00.190
And this was into August now,
and normally sharks peak in June, July,

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:03.203
and you rarely see them,
or rarely can be in the right place

00:14:03.227 --> 00:14:04.778
to find sharks into August.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.232
We were desperate,
so we rushed out to the Blaskets

00:14:07.256 --> 00:14:09.326
as soon as we heard
there were sharks there,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.877
and managed to find some sharks.

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:14.365
So by just rubbing
the mop handle down the shark

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:15.957
as it swam under the boat --

00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:18.491
you see a shark
running under the boat here --

00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:19.857
we managed to collect slime.

00:14:19.881 --> 00:14:21.129
And here it is.

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:24.882
Look at that lovely black shark slime.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:29.499
And in about half an hour,
we got five samples.

00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:31.276
Five individual sharks were sampled

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.132
using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:35.971
(Laughter)

00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:41.326
(Applause)

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.604
I've been working on whales and dolphins
in Ireland for 20 years now,

00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:46.167
and they're a bit more dramatic.

00:14:46.191 --> 00:14:48.227
You probably saw
the humpback whale footage

00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:50.361
we got a month or two ago
off County Wexford.

00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:52.635
And you always think
you might have some legacy

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.153
you can leave the world behind,

00:14:54.177 --> 00:14:57.112
and I was thinking of humpback
whales breaching and dolphins.

00:14:57.136 --> 00:14:59.521
But hey -- sometimes
these things are sent to you

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.737
and you just have to take them
when they come.

00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:03.858
So this is possibly
going to be my legacy --

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:05.524
Simon's Shark Slime.

00:15:05.548 --> 00:15:07.182
We got more money this year

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:09.827
to carry on collecting
more and more samples.

00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:12.791
One thing that is very useful
is that we use a pole camera --

00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:15.228
this is my colleague, Joanne,
with a pole camera --

00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:17.191
where you can look underneath the shark.

00:15:17.215 --> 00:15:19.984
What you're trying to look at is,
the males have claspers,

00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:22.628
which kind of dangle out
behind the back of the shark.

00:15:22.652 --> 00:15:25.249
So you can quite easily tell
the gender of the shark.

00:15:25.273 --> 00:15:29.020
If we can tell the gender of the shark
before we sample it,

00:15:29.044 --> 00:15:32.151
we can tell the geneticist
this was taken from a male or a female.

00:15:32.175 --> 00:15:34.678
Because in the moment,
they have no way, genetically,

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:37.240
of telling the difference
between a male and a female,

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:38.423
which I find staggering,

00:15:38.447 --> 00:15:41.032
because they don't know
what primers to look for.

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:43.370
Being able to tell the gender of a shark

00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:47.636
is very important
for things like policing the trade

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.056
in basking shark and other species
through the sightings,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.295
because it is illegal
to trade in these sharks.

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:56.357
And they are caught and are on the market.

00:15:56.381 --> 00:15:57.752
So as a field biologist,

00:15:57.776 --> 00:16:00.222
you just want to get encounters
with these animals,

00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:01.636
and learn as much as you can.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.070
They're often quite brief,
they're often very seasonally constrained.

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.999
You just want to learn as much
as you can as soon as you can.

00:16:08.023 --> 00:16:09.790
But isn't it fantastic

00:16:09.814 --> 00:16:13.313
that you can then offer
these samples and opportunities

00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:16.157
to other disciplines,
such as the geneticists,

00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:18.636
who can gain so much more from that.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.366
So as I said, these things
are sent to you in strange ways.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.636
Grab them while you can.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.602
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.

00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:28.713
Hopefully, I might get something
a bit more dramatic and romantic

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:29.986
before I die.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.415
But for the time being,
thank you for that.

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:33.925
And keep an eye out for sharks.

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.695
If you're more interested, we have
a basking shark website now set up.

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:39.689
So thank you and thank you for listening.

00:16:39.713 --> 00:16:41.660
(Applause)
