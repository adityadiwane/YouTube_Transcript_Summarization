00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:16.671
Namaskar.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.110
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:23.664
and I don't use Botox as yet.

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:24.904
(Laughter)

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:29.128
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
like a 21-year-old in my movies.

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:31.504
Yeah, I do that.

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:36.424
I sell dreams, and I peddle love
to millions of people back home in India

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:38.704
who assume that I'm
the best lover in the world.

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.928
(Laughter)

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:44.544
If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:46.504
but I never let that assumption go away.

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:47.544
(Laughter)

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.184
I've also been made to understand

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.664
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:53.144
and I feel really sad for you.

00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:55.584
(Laughter)

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:58.288
(Applause)

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:03.984
That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:05.264
as a movie star should be.

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:06.344
(Laughter)

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.984
That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:11.574
to speak about the future "you."

00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:14.534
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:16.878
(Laughter)

00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:21.864
Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.

00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:23.104
(Laughter)

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:24.504
It is. It is.

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:26.048
It's an aging movie star,

00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:29.824
grappling with all
the newness around itself,

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.504
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:34.544
and still trying to find a way

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:36.648
to keep on shining regardless.

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:40.888
I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.264
And my father was a freedom fighter.

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:47.318
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:52.384
And much like the original homo sapiens,

00:01:52.408 --> 00:01:54.048
we struggled to survive.

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:56.864
When I was in my early 20s,

00:01:56.888 --> 00:01:58.624
I lost both my parents,

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:01.984
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:03.304
but --

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:06.328
(Laughter)

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:10.744
I do remember the night my father died,

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:15.664
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:18.504
He mumbled something
about "dead people don't tip so well"

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.968
and walked away into the dark.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.704
And I was only 14 then,

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:26.184
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:27.424
and my mother besides me,

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:30.024
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:33.664
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:35.488
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:41.104
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.424
"Just now, Mom."

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:44.704
(Laughter)

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.264
So from that night onwards,

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:48.984
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.328
I learned the crude tools of survival.

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:56.624
And the framework of life was
very, very simple then, to be honest.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:59.624
You know, you just ate what you got

00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:01.464
and did whatever you were told to do.

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:04.824
I thought celiac was a vegetable,

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:09.384
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
lost comrade in "Star Trek."

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:10.504
(Laughter)

00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:13.504
You married the first girl that you dated,

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:17.368
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:22.408
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:26.904
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:28.184
(Laughter)

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.408
Where was I?

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:34.864
We relied on systems

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:38.584
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before

00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:40.064
to protect us,

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:43.744
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.704
Science was simple and logical,

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:48.048
Apple was still then just a fruit

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.064
owned by Eve first and then Newton,

00:03:51.088 --> 00:03:53.424
not by Steve Jobs, until then.

00:03:53.448 --> 00:03:55.144
And "Eureka!" was what you screamed

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.368
when you wanted
to run naked on the streets.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:01.664
You went wherever life took you for work,

00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:03.768
and people were mostly welcoming of you.

00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:06.384
Migration was a term then

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:08.968
still reserved for Siberian cranes,
not human beings.

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:12.664
Most importantly, you were who you were

00:04:12.688 --> 00:04:14.528
and you said what you thought.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:16.464
Then in my late 20s,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:20.224
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,

00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:21.584
and my framework,

00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:24.904
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,

00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:26.128
began to alter.

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.368
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.224
things started to look a little different.

00:04:32.248 --> 00:04:35.048
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:39.184
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:41.328
Definitions became more and more fluid.

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:44.448
Work began to define you at that time

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.864
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.744
and all the systems
started to feel less reliable to me,

00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:53.904
almost too thick to hold on

00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:55.904
to the diversity of mankind

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.968
and the human need to progress and grow.

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:02.248
Ideas were flowing
with more freedom and speed.

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:08.544
And I experienced the miracle
of human innovation and cooperation,

00:05:08.568 --> 00:05:09.984
and my own creativity,

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:14.504
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,

00:05:14.528 --> 00:05:16.368
catapulted me into superstardom.

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:19.384
I started to feel that I had arrived,

00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:22.904
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.

00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:24.184
I was all over the place.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.224
You know? I'd done 50 films by then

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.848
and 200 songs,

00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:30.864
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:34.184
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:37.544
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:38.624
(Laughter)

00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:42.064
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.

00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:45.424
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie --

00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:48.184
(Laughter)

00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:49.704
for two and a half seconds.

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:51.024
(Laughter)

00:05:51.048 --> 00:05:53.744
And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:54.984
OK, maybe not.

00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:58.544
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table

00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.608
with her back towards me most of the time.

00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:03.648
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,

00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.824
and humanity was soaring with me.

00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:10.528
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.

00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:12.808
And then you all know what happened.

00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:14.568
The internet happened.

00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:17.504
I was in my late 40s,

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:20.168
and I started tweeting
like a canary in a birdcage

00:06:21.088 --> 00:06:24.064
and assuming that, you know,
people who peered into my world

00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:25.344
would admire it

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.464
for the miracle I believed it to be.

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.688
But something else
awaited me and humanity.

00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:35.464
You know, we had expected
an expansion of ideas and dreams

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:38.088
with the enhanced
connectivity of the world.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:45.328
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,

00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:48.544
of judgment, of definition

00:06:48.568 --> 00:06:50.704
that flowed from the same place

00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:52.968
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.

00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:56.090
Everything I said took a new meaning.

00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:58.688
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --

00:06:59.648 --> 00:07:02.984
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.

00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:05.608
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also

00:07:06.408 --> 00:07:07.608
met with the same fate.

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:09.728
Four years ago,

00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:14.728
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:17.488
It was claimed on the net

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.704
that he was the love child

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:21.928
of our first child

00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:23.808
who was 15 years old.

00:07:24.608 --> 00:07:27.704
Apparently, he had sown
his wild oats with a girl

00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:29.928
while driving her car in Romania.

00:07:30.808 --> 00:07:33.008
And yeah, there was
a fake video to go with it.

00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.264
And we were so disturbed as a family.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.544
My son, who is 19 now,

00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:38.384
even now when you say "hello" to him,

00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:39.864
he just turns around and says,

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.584
"But bro, I didn't even have
a European driving license."

00:07:42.608 --> 00:07:45.064
(Laughter)

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.368
Yeah.

00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:48.544
In this new world,

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.944
slowly, reality became virtual
and virtual became real,

00:07:51.968 --> 00:07:53.624
and I started to feel

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:57.184
that I could not be who I wanted to be
or say what I actually thought,

00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:59.008
and humanity at this time

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:02.064
completely identified with me.

00:08:02.088 --> 00:08:05.088
I think both of us
were going through our midlife crisis,

00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:10.224
and humanity, like me,
was becoming an overexposed prima donna.

00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:11.944
I started to sell everything,

00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:14.864
from hair oil to diesel generators.

00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:16.904
Humanity was buying everything

00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:19.304
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.

00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:23.304
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit

00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:25.368
to reinvent myself.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:28.048
I must admit I failed miserably.

00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:33.864
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.984
and Supermen of the world,

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:37.864
you have to commend them,

00:08:37.888 --> 00:08:40.664
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.

00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:41.744
(Laughter)

00:08:41.768 --> 00:08:44.248
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:46.984
Really.

00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:50.544
And accidentally, I happened
to even invent a new dance form

00:08:50.568 --> 00:08:52.703
which I didn't realize,
and it became a rage.

00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:53.943
So if it's all right,

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:57.144
and you've seen a bit of me,
so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.

00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:58.624
It was called the Lungi dance.

00:08:58.648 --> 00:09:01.744
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.

00:09:01.768 --> 00:09:02.984
(Cheers)

00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:05.088
So it went something like this.

00:09:05.688 --> 00:09:08.104
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:10.544
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:13.224
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi.

00:09:13.248 --> 00:09:14.904
That's it. It became a rage.

00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:16.224
(Cheers)

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:17.448
It really did.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.424
Like you notice, nobody could make
any sense of what was happening except me,

00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:25.064
and I didn't give a damn, really,

00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:27.304
because the whole world,
and whole humanity,

00:09:27.328 --> 00:09:29.248
seemed as confused and lost as I was.

00:09:30.368 --> 00:09:31.624
I didn't give up then.

00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:34.424
I even tried to reconstruct
my identity on the social media

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.704
like everyone else does.

00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:38.464
I thought if I put on
philosophical tweets out there

00:09:38.488 --> 00:09:40.064
people will think I'm with it,

00:09:40.088 --> 00:09:42.664
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets

00:09:42.688 --> 00:09:46.024
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:48.104
ROFL, LOL.

00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:52.424
"Adidas," somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:54.784
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,

00:09:54.808 --> 00:09:57.704
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?

00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:00.584
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.

00:10:00.608 --> 00:10:03.568
"Adidas" now means
"All day I dream about sex."

00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:06.384
(Laughter)

00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:07.704
Really.

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:09.224
I didn't know if you know that.

00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:13.824
So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:18.288
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.

00:10:19.008 --> 00:10:20.208
WTF.

00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:23.328
But here we are.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.904
I am 51 years old, like I told you,

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:29.504
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.824
I just want to tell you

00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:34.064
if there has been a momentous time
for humanity to exist,

00:10:34.088 --> 00:10:35.704
it is now,

00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:37.968
because the present you is brave.

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:40.464
The present you is hopeful.

00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:43.784
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,

00:10:43.808 --> 00:10:47.048
and of course, the present you
is annoyingly indefinable.

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:49.768
And in this spell-binding,

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.544
imperfect moment of existence,

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.144
feeling a little brave
just before I came here,

00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:58.168
I decided to take
a good, hard look at my face.

00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:03.144
And I realized that I'm beginning
to look more and more

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:05.584
like the wax statue of me
at Madame Tussaud's.

00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:07.864
(Laughter)

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:10.384
Yeah, and in that moment of realization,

00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:14.648
I asked the most central
and pertinent question to humanity and me:

00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:17.968
Do I need to fix my face?

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:22.544
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,

00:11:22.568 --> 00:11:25.944
a modern expression of human creativity.

00:11:25.968 --> 00:11:27.504
The land I come from

00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:32.488
is the source of inexplicable
but very simple spirituality.

00:11:33.688 --> 00:11:35.368
In its immense generosity,

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.944
India decided somehow

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:42.944
that I, the Muslim son
of a broke freedom fighter

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:46.808
who accidentally ventured
into the business of selling dreams,

00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:51.648
should become its king of romance,

00:11:52.648 --> 00:11:55.008
the "Badhshah of Bollywood,"

00:11:55.688 --> 00:11:58.448
the greatest lover
the country has ever seen ...

00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:00.528
with this face.

00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:02.264
Yeah.

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.384
(Laughter)

00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:06.304
Which has alternately
been described as ugly, unconventional,

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:08.144
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:11.048
(Laughter)

00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:15.824
The people of this ancient land

00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:18.264
embraced me in their limitless love,

00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:19.968
and I've learned from these people

00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:23.208
that neither power nor poverty

00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:25.744
can make your life more magical

00:12:25.768 --> 00:12:27.048
or less tortuous.

00:12:27.768 --> 00:12:30.384
I've learned from the people of my country

00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:32.504
that the dignity of a life,

00:12:32.528 --> 00:12:36.128
a human being, a culture,
a religion, a country

00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:39.048
actually resides in its ability

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:41.648
for grace and compassion.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.408
I've learned that whatever moves you,

00:12:45.088 --> 00:12:47.784
whatever urges you to create, to build,

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.464
whatever keeps you from failing,

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:51.744
whatever helps you survive,

00:12:51.768 --> 00:12:56.144
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,

00:12:56.168 --> 00:12:58.048
and that is love.

00:12:59.328 --> 00:13:02.224
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.414
(Recites poem in Hindi)

00:13:12.928 --> 00:13:14.584
(Poem ends)

00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:17.184
Which loosely translates
into that whatever --

00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.284
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.

00:13:19.308 --> 00:13:20.744
(Applause)

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.292
It's very difficult to remember.

00:13:23.248 --> 00:13:25.824
Which loosely translates
into actually saying

00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:28.304
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read

00:13:28.328 --> 00:13:31.224
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge

00:13:31.248 --> 00:13:34.584
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,

00:13:34.608 --> 00:13:37.744
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future

00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:43.888
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.

00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:48.104
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "प्रेम,"

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.544
which means "love,"

00:13:49.568 --> 00:13:51.464
if you are able to understand that

00:13:51.488 --> 00:13:53.064
and practice it,

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:56.288
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.008
So I truly believe the future "you"

00:13:59.968 --> 00:14:01.648
has to be a you that loves.

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:04.488
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.

00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:08.808
It will perish in its own self-absorption.

00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:11.768
So you may use your power

00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:14.184
to build walls

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:15.648
and keep people outside,

00:14:16.968 --> 00:14:20.768
or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.

00:14:21.848 --> 00:14:23.624
You may use your faith

00:14:23.648 --> 00:14:25.088
to make people afraid

00:14:26.168 --> 00:14:27.928
and terrify them into submission,

00:14:29.048 --> 00:14:31.504
or you can use it
to give courage to people

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:35.264
so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.

00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:37.224
You can use your energy

00:14:37.248 --> 00:14:40.584
to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,

00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:44.368
or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.

00:14:45.368 --> 00:14:49.384
You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.

00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:51.824
You can destroy the ecology,

00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:54.024
or turn to them with love

00:14:54.048 --> 00:14:56.288
and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.

00:14:57.288 --> 00:14:59.064
You may land on Mars

00:14:59.088 --> 00:15:00.848
and build armed citadels,

00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:07.408
or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.

00:15:08.248 --> 00:15:11.984
And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned

00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:13.568
to wage futile wars

00:15:14.928 --> 00:15:17.824
and give guns in the hands
of little children

00:15:17.848 --> 00:15:19.208
to kill each other with,

00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:21.488
or you can use it

00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:23.984
to make more food

00:15:24.008 --> 00:15:25.408
to fill their stomachs with.

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:28.144
My country has taught me

00:15:28.168 --> 00:15:32.528
the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.

00:15:33.568 --> 00:15:38.024
It shines forth in a world

00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:43.128
which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.

00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:47.224
In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people

00:15:47.248 --> 00:15:48.984
coming and showing their talent,

00:15:49.008 --> 00:15:52.344
talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:55.704
the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here

00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:58.504
in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you

00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:01.544
are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future "us."

00:16:01.568 --> 00:16:03.048
But within that celebration

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:07.768
the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion

00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:12.248
has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,

00:16:12.968 --> 00:16:14.808
just as equally.

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:18.008
So I believe the future "you"

00:16:18.848 --> 00:16:20.128
is an infinite you.

00:16:21.048 --> 00:16:23.608
It's called a chakra
in India, like a circle.

00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:27.488
It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:32.584
A you that perceives
time and space differently

00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:33.928
understands both

00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.008
your unimaginable

00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:43.744
and fantastic importance

00:16:43.768 --> 00:16:49.368
and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.

00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:51.968
A you that returns back

00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:54.624
to the original innocence of humanity,

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:56.728
which loves from the purity of heart,

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:59.888
which sees from the eyes of truth,

00:17:01.128 --> 00:17:06.728
which dreams from the clarity
of an untampered mind.

00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:09.408
The future "you" has to be

00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:11.928
like an aging movie star

00:17:12.888 --> 00:17:15.824
who has been made to believe
that there is a possibility

00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:18.623
of a world which is completely,

00:17:18.648 --> 00:17:21.664
wholly, self-obsessively

00:17:21.688 --> 00:17:22.888
in love with itself.

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:27.064
A world -- really, it has to be a you

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.024
to create a world

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:30.848
which is its own best lover.

00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:33.664
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:35.224
should be the future "you."

00:17:35.247 --> 00:17:36.704
Thank you very much.

00:17:36.728 --> 00:17:37.944
Shukriya.

00:17:37.968 --> 00:17:40.103
(Applause)

00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:41.343
Thank you.

00:17:41.368 --> 00:17:44.304
(Applause)

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:45.584
Thank you.

00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:48.208
(Applause)
