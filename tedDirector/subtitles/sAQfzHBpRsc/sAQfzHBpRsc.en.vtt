00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Back in New York, I am the head of development

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Now in our town,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to get in on any action.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I remember my first fire.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I was the second volunteer on the scene,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
to get to the captain in charge

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
to find out what our assignments would be.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
When I found the captain,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
he was having a very engaging conversation

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
with the homeowner,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Here it was, the middle of the night,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
she was standing outside in the pouring rain,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
while her house was in flames.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
let's call him Lex Luther --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
(Laughter)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
got to the captain first

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and was asked to go inside

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and save the homeowner's dog.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Here was some lawyer or money manager

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that he went into a burning building

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
to save a living creature,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
just because he beat me by five seconds.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Well, I was next.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
The captain waved me over.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
(Laughter)

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I swear.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So, not exactly what I was hoping for,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
but off I went --

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Now I know what you're thinking,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but I'm no hero.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260
(Laughter)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I carried my payload back downstairs

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
where I met my nemesis

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and the precious dog by the front door.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
where, not surprisingly,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
his received much more attention than did mine.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
A few weeks later,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
the department received a letter from the homeowner

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
thanking us for the valiant effort displayed

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
in saving her home.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
The act of kindness she noted above all others:

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
(Laughter)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
In both my vocation at Robin Hood

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
on a monumental scale,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
on an individual basis.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And you know what I've learned?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
They all matter.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
So as I look around this room

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at people who either have achieved,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
or are on their way to achieving,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
remarkable levels of success,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I would offer this reminder:

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
don't wait.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Don't wait until you make your first million

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to make a difference in somebody's life.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If you have something to give,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
give it now.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Be a mentor.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Not every day is going to offer us a chance

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to save somebody's life,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So get in the game. Save the shoes.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Thank you.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
(Applause)

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.260
(Applause)

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
