00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I only have three minutes

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that got me thinking.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I've had some time to think it over.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And energy efficiency is more than just

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
about the vehicle --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
it's also about the road.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
of which there are two types: signalized

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Roundabouts are much better.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
A study of 24 intersections

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
has found crashes drop 40 percent

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
fatal crashes down 90 percent.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
But that's just safety.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
What about time and gas?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
less time wasted,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
than we have in the United States.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
So, unsignalized intersections,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
They're expensive to install,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.260
But they are not applicable in all situations.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
on the minor road entering the major.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But the other two are somewhat questionable.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Cars rarely appear on that third road.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
cars per day in each direction,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that's $51,000 per year.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
wear on the car, and time.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
What's that time worth?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
just for that sign in each direction.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Discount that back to the present, at five percent:

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
over two million dollars

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
for a stop sign, in each direction.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
you could actually buy the property,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and then sell it off again.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And you'd still come out ahead.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The answer is to enable cars

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
to come in from that side road safely.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Stop signs were invented in 1915,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So, why not use a yield sign?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
of alternating, or taking turns,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and it's always on the minor road,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
allowing the major one to have primacy.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
That would not work.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
So, what the world needs now

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
is a new type of sign.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
(Applause)

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And uncertainty results in caution.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
they slow down.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.260
(Laughter)

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
But you all are members of communities,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and you can exercise your community influence

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
to create more sensible traffic flows.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And you can have more impact on the environment

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
just getting your neighborhood to change these things

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
(Applause)
