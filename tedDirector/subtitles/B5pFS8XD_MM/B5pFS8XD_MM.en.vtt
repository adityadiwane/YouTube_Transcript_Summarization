00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.494
This is my favorite place on earth,

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.518
Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:22.228
And when it's covered
in a thin layer of water,

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:23.419
it reflects the clouds.

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:27.867
There are days when you feel
as if you're floating among the clouds.

00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:31.269
But there are days
when the horizon disappears;

00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:33.713
there's no longer a top or a bottom.

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:36.758
You feel immersed in something bigger.

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:42.241
It was there that one night
I woke up from a dream,

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:45.149
and I saw that the stars
were also reflected on the water.

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:47.257
And that wasn't a dream.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.094
It was as if you could walk
among the stars.

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:53.465
With every step I took,
the stars reverberated under my feet.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.417
It was like I was floating in the universe
among clouds of galaxies.

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:02.803
But what's floating there today
are not just clouds of galaxies

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:05.009
but also clouds of plastic.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.960
These are the footprints
we're leaving on the planet.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.826
They're signs of an era

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.804
in which the behavior of some humans
is making a global impact

00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:17.291
on our ecosystems.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.690
This era is called the Anthropocene.

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:24.824
There's also another type
of toxic clouds that float in the air,

00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:27.784
like the ones that form
from carbon dioxide emissions

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.247
and from the burning of fossil fuels --
oil, carbon, gas --

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.461
clouds that, when we see them,

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:35.051
pollute our dreams.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:37.694
I don't know about all of you,

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:40.330
but I've always dreamed of floating
among the clouds.

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:43.927
Maybe today we can imagine together
other types of clouds,

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:45.734
clouds we can live with.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.991
If you're wondering
about that photo, I'll explain:

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:51.958
it looks like a collage
or photomontage -- something weird.

00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:53.338
No; it's reality.

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:55.888
But sometimes I ask myself:
What is reality?

00:01:55.912 --> 00:01:57.581
According to Alexander Kluge:

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:00.169
"Human beings are not
interested in reality.

00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:03.451
They can’t be; it’s part
of the human essence.

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:04.956
They have desires.

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:09.201
These desires are totally opposed
to any form of reality.

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:10.917
They prefer to lie

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.134
than to become divorced
from their desires."

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.212
But how can we learn
to float among the clouds?

00:02:18.817 --> 00:02:23.714
As an artist, I thought we could start
building a flying museum.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.422
You're probably wondering:
With plastic bags?

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:29.386
In 2007, with a community of people
all over the world,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.288
we began to collect used plastic bags --

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:33.876
not new ones.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.900
And we washed them,

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.118
we cut them up,

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:39.569
we glued them together,

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.537
and we began to draw on them,

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.384
creating a huge canvas.

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:45.408
We made a collection of drawings,

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:46.710
of personal stories

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.338
and of friendships.

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:50.174
And when you join them,

00:02:50.198 --> 00:02:52.198
bend them and fold them,

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:54.593
it creates a space full of air.

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:56.811
When the sun comes up from the horizon,

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.993
the museum rises up to the sky.

00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:02.328
That's why we call it,
"The Aero-Solar Museum."

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:03.669
And from this simple idea,

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:06.580
we learned how to float in the air
in a radically new way,

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.824
without using any type of fuel.

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:12.539
The difference in temperature
between the interior and the exterior

00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:14.563
is what makes us rise up.

00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:16.082
That way,

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:21.299
we don't use fossil fuels
or helium or hydrogen;

00:03:21.323 --> 00:03:23.489
we don't use solar panels

00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:25.513
or batteries or motors.

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:31.358
We discovered a way that's simple,
clean and accessible to the whole world

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:32.772
to lift ourselves up.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:37.526
I remember when I was at NASA in 2009
with 120 engineers.

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.815
You guys know, too,
when you go up in a plane,

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.902
the control panels are gigantic.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:46.542
And what we're doing is really complex,

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:49.538
and when I started coming in
with the plastic bags, saying,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.221
"But we have a different way ..."

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.585
people had a hard time
understanding the concept.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.153
Seeing the power of this idea,

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:56.816
we started to initiate a new era;

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.814
one that would leave behind
the violence of the Anthropocene

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.325
and give way to a new era,

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.419
which we call the "Aerocene" --

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.259
an era of ecological awareness,

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:09.460
in which we learn to float together,
live together in the air,

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:11.149
and come to an ethical commitment

00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:13.321
with the atmosphere and with planet earth.

00:04:14.297 --> 00:04:16.418
That's why I've brought
this backpack today.

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:17.606
Let's see ...

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:30.204
OK. This is a balloon
that we also refer to as a sculpture.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.118
And if it's sunny out tomorrow,
we can go out and fly --

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:35.454
though, no, the weather
in Vancouver isn't --

00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:36.934
(Laughter)

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.026
it's not very ...

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.235
very favorable.

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.419
So, what other features does it have?

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:45.806
It has sensors that, when it moves,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830
make sort of drawings in the air.

00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:50.513
It also has other sensors.

00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.737
I always think that first
you have to feel it,

00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:54.408
and then you can measure it;

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.145
you need to hear the sounds
of the atmosphere,

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.703
of the climate, of the hot air,

00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:00.798
in order to then measure the ozone,

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.615
the carbon dioxide.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.180
We're developing these sensors

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.881
together with different communities
all over the world

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:10.710
in order to reconnect with the climate,
the temperature and the environment,

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:12.948
because there are other
species in the air;

00:05:12.972 --> 00:05:15.020
in these excursions
towards the atmosphere,

00:05:15.044 --> 00:05:16.207
we're not alone.

00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:17.991
The air is full of clouds of life.

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.851
We live at the bottom of an ocean of air.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.088
And this same sculpture,

00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:25.880
this exact one in my hands,

00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:28.681
flew 375 miles -- 12 hours --
from Germany to Poland,

00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:29.883
on a fuel-free trip.

00:05:29.907 --> 00:05:32.060
But it wasn't free from crossing borders.

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:34.950
The trip was much more complicated
than what we imagined;

00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:37.092
air space is as regulated and militarized

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:38.647
as land space.

00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:41.692
To fly using the winds,
the heat of the sun

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.454
and the radiant energy of the earth

00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:45.089
is complex and beautiful.

00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:48.137
But even more complex
will be getting the permits

00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.201
to cross the air space
of each of the different countries

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.016
that we fly over using wind.

00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:57.417
At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,

00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:59.563
we presented these spherical sculptures

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:02.113
that could transport us
all over the world.

00:06:02.137 --> 00:06:06.019
But how can we fly using the wind
to arrive at our destination?

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:08.492
Together with MIT, we developed a program

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:11.596
that predicts how we can navigate
the wind highways.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.641
For example, if I had to return
to Berlin from Vancouver,

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:18.356
the first thing I would need to do
is choose an altitude.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.068
At different altitudes,
there are different directions

00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:22.955
and different speeds.

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:26.978
The red line is tomorrow
and the orange, the day after tomorrow.

00:06:27.002 --> 00:06:28.170
And there it goes.

00:06:28.194 --> 00:06:31.256
You can see, the best day
to fly back to Berlin --

00:06:32.414 --> 00:06:34.895
so now, traveling using only wind --

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:37.375
is in six days.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.457
And we can get to 105 miles
from the center of Berlin

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:42.390
without burning a single drop of fuel,

00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:45.301
being transported only by wind currents.

00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:49.203
So we thought that these trajectories
that we drew with the wind

00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:53.860
could become signatures, declaring
"Independence from Fossil Fuels Day."

00:06:54.508 --> 00:06:57.198
More and more of us
are experiencing the air

00:06:57.222 --> 00:06:58.428
in a different way.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:01.080
You're all familiar with Earth Day.

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:03.844
We think we should also celebrate Air Day:

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:05.854
it's a pact that we make with the earth,

00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:07.990
an ethical commitment to the atmosphere.

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:11.725
But let's keep thinking and dreaming.

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:14.914
We've learned that the bigger
the sculptures are,

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.677
the more weight they can lift.

00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:19.894
Remember,

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:25.016
they rise up only with hot air
that's been heated by the sun.

00:07:25.968 --> 00:07:29.555
Using this approach, we can learn
to build gardens in the air.

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.538
Could we one day live in a garden
the size of the earth?

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:36.383
Could we live in an ecosystem
floating among the clouds?

00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:40.891
Answering these questions
isn't just a technological challenge;

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:45.108
it's a way to reexamine
the freedom of movement between countries,

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:49.909
and of overcoming the political,
social, cultural and military restrictions

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:51.621
of contemporary societies.

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.318
Because in the end,

00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:55.039
the air belongs to everybody

00:07:55.063 --> 00:07:57.396
and doesn't answer to any government.

00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:04.668
(Applause)

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.529
And like we said earlier,

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:10.684
our imagination is the force
that allows us to create these places.

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:12.399
This is an installation I did

00:08:12.423 --> 00:08:14.830
at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York.

00:08:14.854 --> 00:08:16.131
It asks the question:

00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:18.899
What might these transnational
spaces be like?

00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:23.058
And once we inhabit those spaces,
we need to learn how to move within them,

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:25.859
to walk among the clouds,

00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:29.764
where every movement affects
everyone else's movements;

00:08:29.788 --> 00:08:32.965
the body weight and proximity
between people

00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:35.013
will cause the space to expand ...

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:36.384
or contract.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.345
There we are, suspended
72 feet in the air.

00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:44.583
When two or more people
get too close together,

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:48.012
even those farthest away are affected --

00:08:48.036 --> 00:08:50.337
everyone falls to the same spot.

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:52.542
These are fragile ecosystems.

00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:58.109
And it's between these spheres
that we build nets that connect us.

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:01.551
There are moments
when we have to face the void,

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.575
and fear can paralyze us.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.732
One of the most beautiful things
about this exhibit

00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:08.533
is the sense of solidarity generated

00:09:08.557 --> 00:09:10.977
when we face these new "aero-graphs."

00:09:11.713 --> 00:09:13.269
Finally,

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:15.293
let me tell you one last story.

00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:17.491
On July 16, 1945,

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.515
on the White Sands of New Mexico,

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:22.755
an atomic bomb was detonated
for the first time.

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:25.131
As a result of this explosion,

00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:29.729
a cloud of radioactive particles
disseminated all over the earth,

00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:32.622
marking the beginning
of the Anthropocene era.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.557
Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,

00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:38.135
in the same place,

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.543
another event occurred.

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.135
For the first time in history,

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:45.317
we lifted a person into the air
using only the sun,

00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:48.114
without burning any fossil fuels.

00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:50.640
As the sun rose up above the horizon,

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:52.301
we rose up, too,

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:53.989
silently,

00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:55.180
slowly,

00:09:55.204 --> 00:09:56.710
with no explosions.

00:09:56.734 --> 00:09:59.370
We felt as if gravity had been inverted;

00:09:59.945 --> 00:10:02.771
it wasn't pulling us
toward the center of the earth,

00:10:02.795 --> 00:10:04.499
but toward the universe.

00:10:05.201 --> 00:10:07.836
If Neil Armstrong said,
when he walked on the moon,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.626
"That's one small step for man,

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.650
one giant leap for mankind,"

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.451
perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:

00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:17.175
What steps do we need to take today?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.631
In the Aerocene era,

00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:23.325
our steps are much smaller,
but radically different;

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.072
they're steps that began with a bag
full of air and wishes,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.030
but that can carry us
to independence from fossil fuels

00:10:33.054 --> 00:10:35.063
and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;

00:10:35.087 --> 00:10:38.404
steps that won't leave footprints
on other planets

00:10:38.428 --> 00:10:42.679
until we've learned to walk
in the atmosphere of this one.

00:10:42.703 --> 00:10:44.758
The landscapes are tiny

00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:46.352
and the steps are tiny,

00:10:46.376 --> 00:10:48.774
but I hope we can take them together.

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:52.622
And I'm sure that these steps will lead us
much further than the moon,

00:10:52.646 --> 00:10:56.546
so we can learn to float
with our feet on the ground.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.732
Thank you.

00:10:57.756 --> 00:11:01.526
(Applause)
