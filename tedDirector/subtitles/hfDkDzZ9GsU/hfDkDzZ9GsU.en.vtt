00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:14.312
I am a chef

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.677
and a food policy guy,

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.072
but I come from a whole
family of teachers.

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:23.391
My sister is a special ed
teacher in Chicago.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.662
My father just retired
after 25 years teaching fifth grade.

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:30.322
My aunt and uncle were professors.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:31.998
My cousins all teach.

00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:35.604
Everybody in my family, basically,
teaches except for me.

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:41.622
They taught me that the only way
to get the right answers

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:44.191
is to ask the right questions.

00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:46.634
So what are the right questions

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:50.817
when it comes to improving
the educational outcomes for our children?

00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:55.628
There's obviously
many important questions,

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:58.124
but I think the following
is a good place to start:

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.090
What do we think the connection is

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:04.533
between a child's growing mind

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:05.949
and their growing body?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.608
What can we expect our kids to learn

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.641
if their diets are full of sugar
and empty of nutrients?

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:16.798
What can they possibly learn

00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:21.284
if their bodies
are literally going hungry?

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:25.964
And with all the resources
that we are pouring into schools,

00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:28.140
we should stop and ask ourselves:

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:31.110
Are we really setting
our kids up for success?

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.824
Now, a few years ago,

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:38.002
I was a judge on a cooking
competition called "Chopped."

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.578
Four chefs compete
with mystery ingredients

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.246
to see who can cook the best dishes.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.648
Except for this episode --
it was a very special one.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:52.834
Instead of four overzealous chefs
trying to break into the limelight --

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:54.925
something that I would know
nothing about --

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:55.990
(Laughter)

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:58.673
these chefs were school chefs;

00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:01.846
you know, the women that you used
to call "lunch ladies,"

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.834
but the ones I insist
we call "school chefs."

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:08.283
Now, these women -- God bless
these women --

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:12.240
spend their day cooking
for thousands of kids,

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:16.032
breakfast and lunch,
with only $2.68 per lunch,

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:19.194
with only about a dollar of that
actually going to the food.

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:22.083
In this episode,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.733
the main-course
mystery ingredient was quinoa.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.061
Now, I know it's been a long time

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.281
since most of you have had a school lunch,

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.917
and we've made a lot
of progress on nutrition,

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.075
but quinoa still is not a staple
in most school cafeterias.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.942
(Laughter)

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.332
So this was a challenge.

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:42.174
But the dish that I will never forget
was cooked by a woman

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:43.855
named Cheryl Barbara.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.613
Cheryl was the nutrition director

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:48.001
at High School in the Community
in Connecticut.

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:50.182
She cooked this delicious pasta.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:51.432
It was amazing.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:54.099
It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:55.895
kale, Parmesan cheese.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.178
It was delicious, like,
restaurant-quality good, except --

00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:02.962
she basically just threw the quinoa,
pretty much uncooked,

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.164
into the dish.

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:06.273
It was a strange choice,

00:03:06.297 --> 00:03:08.770
and it was super crunchy.

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.436
(Laughter)

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.378
So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
that you're supposed to do,

00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.240
and I asked her why she did that.

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:22.113
Cheryl responded, "Well, first,
I don't know what quinoa is."

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:23.197
(Laughter)

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:27.237
"But I do know that it's a Monday,

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:30.618
and that in my school,
at High School in the Community,

00:03:30.642 --> 00:03:32.534
I always cook pasta."

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:35.758
See, Cheryl explained
that for many of her kids,

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:38.812
there were no meals on the weekends.

00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:42.438
No meals on Saturday.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.993
No meals on Sunday, either.

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:50.513
So she cooked pasta
because she wanted to make sure

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:55.275
she cooked something she knew
her children would eat.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.454
Something that would stick
to their ribs, she said.

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:03.138
Something that would fill them up.

00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:08.797
Cheryl talked about how,
by the time Monday came,

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.568
her kids' hunger pangs were so intense

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:15.345
that they couldn't even begin
to think about learning.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.977
Food was the only thing on their mind.

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:23.884
The only thing.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.463
And unfortunately, the stats --
they tell the same story.

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.752
So, let's put this
into the context of a child.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:33.939
And we're going to focus on

00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:36.207
the most important meal
of the day, breakfast.

00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:37.542
Meet Allison.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.070
She's 12 years old,

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:40.750
she's smart as a whip

00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:43.537
and she wants to be a physicist
when she grows up.

00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:47.570
If Allison goes to a school
that serves a nutritious breakfast

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:48.840
to all of their kids,

00:04:48.864 --> 00:04:50.414
here's what's going to follow.

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:54.211
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,

00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:57.401
one with fruit and milk,
one lower in sugar and salt,

00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:59.011
dramatically increase.

00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:03.320
Allison will have a lower rate
of obesity than the average kid.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:05.129
She'll have to visit the nurse less.

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:08.172
She'll have lower levels
of anxiety and depression.

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.712
She'll have better behavior.

00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:12.991
She'll have better attendance,
and she'll show up on time more often.

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:14.387
Why?

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.411
Well, because there's a good meal
waiting for her at school.

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:20.834
Overall, Allison is in much better health

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.942
than the average school kid.

00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:25.520
So what about that kid

00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:28.531
who doesn't have a nutritious
breakfast waiting for him?

00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:29.963
Well, meet Tommy.

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.974
He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.478
He wants to be a doctor.

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:36.549
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,

00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:39.402
he's already underperforming in math.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.354
By the time he's in third grade,

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:44.975
he's got lower math and reading scores.

00:05:46.158 --> 00:05:47.951
By the time he's 11,

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:51.806
it's more likely that Tommy will have
to have repeated a grade.

00:05:53.092 --> 00:05:56.189
Research shows that kids
who do not have consistent nourishment,

00:05:56.213 --> 00:05:57.468
particularly at breakfast,

00:05:57.492 --> 00:06:00.773
have poor cognitive function overall.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.884
So how widespread is this problem?

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:07.871
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:10.453
Let me give you two stats

00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:13.441
that seem like they're on opposite
ends of the issue,

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:15.613
but are actually two sides
of the same coin.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.154
On the one hand,

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:21.386
one in six Americans are food insecure,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.651
including 16 million children --
almost 20 percent --

00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:26.784
are food insecure.

00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:28.895
In this city alone, in New York City,

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:35.477
474,000 kids under the age of 18
face hunger every year.

00:06:36.884 --> 00:06:38.059
It's crazy.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.630
On the other hand,

00:06:40.503 --> 00:06:44.612
diet and nutrition is the number one cause
of preventable death and disease

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:46.339
in this country, by far.

00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:50.492
And fully a third of the kids
that we've been talking about tonight

00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:53.290
are on track to have diabetes
in their lifetime.

00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:57.189
Now, what's hard
to put together but is true

00:06:57.213 --> 00:06:59.756
is that, many times,
these are the same children.

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:03.754
So they fill up on the unhealthy
and cheap calories

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:07.968
that surround them in their communities
and that their families can afford.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.709
But then by the end of the month,

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:15.322
food stamps run out
or hours get cut at work,

00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:18.423
and they don't have the money
to cover the basic cost of food.

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:23.415
But we should be able
to solve this problem, right?

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.107
We know what the answers are.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:30.048
As part of my work at the White House,
we instituted a program

00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:33.566
that for all schools that had
40 percent more low-income kids,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.514
we could serve breakfast and lunch
to every kid in that school.

00:07:38.272 --> 00:07:39.431
For free.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:42.356
This program has been
incredibly successful,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.432
because it helped us overcome
a very difficult barrier

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.601
when it came to getting kids
a nutritious breakfast.

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:52.342
And that was the barrier of stigma.

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:58.026
See, schools serve
breakfast before school,

00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:03.826
and it was only available
for the poor kids.

00:08:05.371 --> 00:08:08.700
So everybody knew who was poor
and who needed government help.

00:08:09.597 --> 00:08:14.397
Now, all kids, no matter how much
or how little their parents make,

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.781
have a lot of pride.

00:08:17.107 --> 00:08:18.384
So what happened?

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:21.445
Well, the schools that have
implemented this program

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:26.168
saw an increase in math and reading
scores by 17.5 percent.

00:08:26.657 --> 00:08:28.572
17.5 percent.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.929
And research shows that when kids
have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:39.544
their chances of graduating
increase by 20 percent.

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:41.904
20 percent.

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:46.771
When we give our kids
the nourishment they need,

00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:48.881
we give them the chance to thrive,

00:08:49.955 --> 00:08:52.036
both in the classroom and beyond.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.866
Now, you don't have to trust me on this,

00:08:56.644 --> 00:08:58.599
but you should talk to Donna Martin.

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:00.996
I love Donna Martin.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.697
Donna Martin is the school nutrition
director at Burke County

00:09:04.721 --> 00:09:06.403
in Waynesboro, Georgia.

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:09.766
Burke County is one
of the poorest districts

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.493
in the fifth-poorest state in the country,

00:09:12.517 --> 00:09:18.646
and about 100 percent of Donna's students
live at or below the poverty line.

00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:20.883
A few years ago,

00:09:20.907 --> 00:09:24.861
Donna decided to get out ahead
of the new standards that were coming,

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:27.171
and overhaul her nutrition standards.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.851
She improved and added
fruit and vegetables and whole grains.

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:35.820
She served breakfast in the classroom
to all of her kids.

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:38.198
And she implemented a dinner program.

00:09:38.222 --> 00:09:39.379
Why?

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:43.430
Well, many of her kids didn't have
dinner when they went home.

00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:46.184
So how did they respond?

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.829
Well, the kids loved the food.

00:09:49.577 --> 00:09:51.265
They loved the better nutrition,

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:53.262
and they loved not being hungry.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:58.416
But Donna's biggest supporter
came from an unexpected place.

00:09:59.055 --> 00:10:01.139
His name from Eric Parker,

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:04.797
and he was the head football coach
for the Burke County Bears.

00:10:05.668 --> 00:10:08.733
Now, Coach Parker had coached
mediocre teams for years.

00:10:08.757 --> 00:10:11.680
The Bears often ended
in the middle of the pack --

00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:14.866
a big disappointment in one
of the most passionate football states

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.058
in the Union.

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:21.150
But the year Donna changed the menus,

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:24.681
the Bears not only won their division,

00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:27.144
they went on to win
the state championship,

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.534
beating the Peach County Trojans

00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:30.880
28-14.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:33.259
(Laughter)

00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.797
And Coach Parker,

00:10:35.507 --> 00:10:38.788
he credited that championship
to Donna Martin.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.035
When we give our kids
the basic nourishment,

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:45.464
they're going to thrive.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.350
And it's not just
up to the Cheryl Barbaras

00:10:49.374 --> 00:10:51.229
and the Donna Martins of the world.

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:53.395
It's on all of us.

00:10:54.218 --> 00:10:58.704
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition
is just the starting point.

00:10:59.517 --> 00:11:01.482
What I've laid out is really a model

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:04.581
for so many of the most pressing
issues that we face.

00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:11.403
If we focus on the simple goal
of properly nourishing ourselves,

00:11:12.514 --> 00:11:15.675
we could see a world
that is more stable and secure;

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:20.097
we could dramatically improve
our economic productivity;

00:11:21.023 --> 00:11:23.574
we could transform our health care

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:26.412
and we could go a long way

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.482
in ensuring that the Earth can provide
for generations to come.

00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:34.174
Food is that place
where our collective efforts

00:11:34.198 --> 00:11:36.071
can have the greatest impact.

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:40.910
So we have to ask ourselves:
What is the right question?

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.462
What would happen

00:11:42.486 --> 00:11:48.011
if we fed ourselves more nutritious,
more sustainably grown food?

00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:50.066
What would be the impact?

00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:52.599
Cheryl Barbara,

00:11:53.909 --> 00:11:55.531
Donna Martin,

00:11:55.555 --> 00:11:57.714
Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --

00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:00.183
I think they know the answer.

00:12:00.207 --> 00:12:01.818
Thank you guys so very much.

00:12:01.842 --> 00:12:06.314
(Applause)
