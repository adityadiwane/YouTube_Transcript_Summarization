(Singing)

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.424

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:24.829

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.787
Pep Rosenfeld: Folks,
you've just met Claron McFadden.

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.398
She is a world-class soprano singer

00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.236
who studied in Rochester, New York.

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:38.235
Her celebrated operatic roles
are numerous and varied.

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:44.220
In August 2007, Claron was awarded
the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:46.059
winning praise for her brilliance,

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:49.489
her amazing and extensively
wide repertoire

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:51.236
and her vivid stage personality.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.650
Please welcome Claron McFadden.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:03:00.594
(Applause)

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.327
Claron McFadden: The human voice:

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:11.107
mysterious, spontaneous, primal.

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:17.990
For me, the human voice is the vessel
on which all emotions travel --

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:19.927
except, perhaps, jealousy.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.315
And the breath,

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.495
the breath is the captain of that vessel.

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:29.153
A child is born,

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.201
takes its first breath --

00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:36.776
(Inhales)

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.160
Whah!

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:43.597
And we behold the wondrous beauty

00:03:44.954 --> 00:03:46.438
of vocal expression --

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:49.811
mysterious, spontaneous

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.050
and primal.

00:03:53.923 --> 00:03:57.065
A few years ago, I did
a meditation retreat in Thailand.

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.542
I wanted a place

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.236
where I would have total silence
and total solitude.

00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:06.595
I spent two weeks at this retreat

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.333
in my own little hut --

00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:11.166
no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,

00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:15.753
trying to find the essence
of concentration,

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.235
being in the moment.

00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:19.794
On my last day,

00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:21.937
the woman who looked after the place,

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:24.851
she came and we spoke for a minute,

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:26.343
and then she said to me,

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.236
"Would you sing something for me?"

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.192
And I thought, but this is a place
of total quiet and silence.

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:34.747
I can't make noise.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.260
She said, "Please, sing for me."

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:41.236
So I closed my eyes,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.457
I took breath

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.600
and the first thing that came up and out

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:49.862
was "Summertime,"

00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.235
Porgy and Bess.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.402
(Singing) Summertime
and the livin' is easy.

00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:00.774
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:04.783
Oh, your daddy's rich
and your ma is good-lookin'.

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:06.397
So hush little baby,

00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:08.846
don't you cry.

00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:11.814
And I opened my eyes,

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:15.236
and I saw that she had her eyes closed.

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.104
And after a moment, she opened her eyes

00:05:18.128 --> 00:05:19.786
and she looked at me and she said,

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:22.662
"It's like meditation."

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:25.987
And in that moment I understood

00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:29.423
that everything I had gone
to Thailand to look for,

00:05:29.447 --> 00:05:31.033
to search for,

00:05:31.057 --> 00:05:33.452
I had it already in my singing --

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:37.819
the calm, but alertness,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.153
the focus, but awareness,

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:44.613
and being totally in the moment.

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.041
When you're totally in the moment --

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:49.564
when I'm totally in the moment,

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:51.793
the vessel of expression is open.

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:54.389
The emotions can flow from me

00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:55.586
to you

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.806
and back.

00:05:57.817 --> 00:05:59.706
It's an extremely profound experience.

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:04.397
There's a piece by a composer,

00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:07.019
an American composer called John Cage.

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:08.623
It's called "Aria."

00:06:08.647 --> 00:06:13.236
It was written for an amazing singer
called Cathy Berberian.

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:16.236
And the thing about this piece
that's so special --

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:18.236
if you see it behind me --

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:21.441
it's not notated in any way.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.360
No notes, no flats, no sharps.

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:27.804
But it's a kind of structure.

00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.891
And the singer, within this structure,

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:34.935
has total freedom
to be creative, spontaneous.

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:36.689
For example,

00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.379
there are different colors

00:06:39.403 --> 00:06:43.355
and each color gets
a different type of singing --

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.268
pop, country and western, opera, jazz --

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:50.419
and you just have
to be consistent with that color.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.459
You see there are different lines.

00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:56.205
You choose in your own tempo
in your own way

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.482
to follow the line,

00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.914
but you must respect it,

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:00.883
more or less.

00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:02.875
And these little dots,

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.324
these represent a sort of sound

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.236
that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.467
of expressing the voice.

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.552
Using the body -- it could be sneezing,

00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:17.155
it could be coughing, animals --

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:18.774
(Audience member coughs)

00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:20.090
Exactly. (Laughter)

00:07:20.114 --> 00:07:21.767
Clapping, whatever.

00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:25.105
And there's different text.

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:28.864
There's Armenian, Russian,
French, English, Italian.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:31.967
So within this structure, one is free.

00:07:32.945 --> 00:07:35.548
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,

00:07:36.992 --> 00:07:39.540
because it's mysterious, as we can see.

00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:43.055
It's quite spontaneous.

00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:47.154
And it's primal.

00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:49.955
So I would like to share
this piece with you,

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.929
It's "Aria," of John Cage.

00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:00.981
(Singing in various languages)

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:05.457

Dans l'espace, so help
