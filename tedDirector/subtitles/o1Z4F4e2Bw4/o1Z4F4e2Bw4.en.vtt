00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.087
How do you find a dinosaur?

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:17.753
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.945
It's not.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:24.195
And the answer relies on a formula
that all paleontologists use.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.674
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.290
First, find rocks of the right age.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:35.320
Second, those rocks
must be sedimentary rocks.

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:40.303
And third, layers of those rocks
must be naturally exposed.

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:41.919
That's it.

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:45.354
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.783
chances are good
that you will find fossils.

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:50.403
Now let me break down this formula.

00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:55.183
Organisms exist only during certain
geological intervals.

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:57.637
So you have to find
rocks of the right age,

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.829
depending on what your interests are.

00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:01.363
If you want to find trilobites,

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:04.538
you have to find the really,
really old rocks of the Paleozoic --

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:07.867
rocks between a half a billion
and a quarter-billion years old.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:10.394
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:12.775
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.280
They hadn't evolved yet.

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.391
You have to find the younger
rocks of the Mesozoic,

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:18.812
and in the case of dinosaurs,

00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:22.561
between 235 and 66 million years ago.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.670
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
of the right age at this point,

00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:29.826
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.180
geologically mapped.

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:33.761
This is hard-won information.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.127
The annals of Earth history
are written in rocks,

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:38.452
one chapter upon the next,

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:41.080
such that the oldest pages are on bottom

00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:42.758
and the youngest on top.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.636
Now, were it quite that easy,
geologists would rejoice.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.918
It's not.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.996
The library of Earth is an old one.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.659
It has no librarian to impose order.

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.241
Operating over vast swaths of time,

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:01.398
myriad geological processes
offer every possible insult

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:03.505
to the rocks of ages.

00:02:04.277 --> 00:02:06.946
Most pages are destroyed
soon after being written.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.162
Some pages are overwritten,

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:13.756
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
of long-gone landscapes.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:18.525
Pages that do find sanctuary
under the advancing sands of time

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.768
are never truly safe.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.754
Unlike the Moon --
our dead, rocky companion --

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:28.418
the Earth is alive, pulsing
with creative and destructive forces

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:30.893
that power its geological metabolism.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:34.237
Lunar rocks brought back
by the Apollo astronauts

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:37.228
all date back to about the age
of the Solar System.

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.849
Moon rocks are forever.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.086
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.694
All will suffer ruination,

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:49.544
through some combination
of mutilation, compression,

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.074
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.192
Thus, the volumes of Earth history
are incomplete and disheveled.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.694
The library is vast and magnificent --

00:03:03.964 --> 00:03:05.258
but decrepit.

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:09.139
And it was this tattered complexity
in the rock record

00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:12.194
that obscured its meaning
until relatively recently.

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.357
Nature provided no card catalog
for geologists --

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:17.094
this would have to be invented.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.710
Five thousand years after the Sumerians
learned to record their thoughts

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.886
on clay tablets,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.993
the Earth's volumes remained
inscrutable to humans.

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:28.959
We were geologically illiterate,

00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:32.819
unaware of the antiquity
of our own planet

00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:34.352
and ignorant of our connection

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:35.573
to deep time.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.216
It wasn't until the turn
of the 19th century

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.636
that our blinders were removed,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.054
first, with the publication
of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"

00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:50.950
in which he told us that the Earth
reveals no vestige of a beginning

00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:52.752
and no prospect of an end;

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:57.491
and then, with the printing
of William Smith's map of Britain,

00:03:57.515 --> 00:03:59.700
the first country-scale geological map,

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:01.090
giving us for the first time

00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:05.042
predictive insight into where
certain types of rocks might occur.

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.527
After that, you could say things like,

00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:10.554
"If we go over there,
we should be in the Jurassic,"

00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:14.329
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.984
So now, if you want to find trilobites,

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.137
get yourself a good geological map

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.412
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.

00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:25.342
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.420
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.

00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:32.316
Now of course, you can only make
a fossil in a sedimentary rock,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.989
a rock made by sand and mud.

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.656
You can't have a fossil

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.004
in an igneous rock formed
by magma, like a granite,

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:42.090
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.

00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:44.908
And you have to get yourself in a desert.

00:04:45.378 --> 00:04:48.459
It's not that dinosaurs
particularly lived in deserts;

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:50.047
they lived on every land mass

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:52.128
and in every imaginable environment.

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:55.541
It's that you need to go to a place
that's a desert today,

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:58.739
a place that doesn't have
too many plants covering up the rocks,

00:04:58.763 --> 00:05:02.643
and a place where erosion is always
exposing new bones at the surface.

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.835
So find those three things:

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.414
rocks of the right age,

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:09.487
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,

00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:11.068
and get yourself on the ground,

00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:12.604
and you literally walk

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:15.216
until you see a bone
sticking out of the rock.

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:19.664
Here's a picture that I took
in Southern Patagonia.

00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:23.109
Every pebble that you see
on the ground there

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:24.656
is a piece of dinosaur bone.

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:27.344
So when you're in that right situation,

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:30.122
it's not a question of whether
you'll find fossils or not;

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:31.535
you're going to find fossils.

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.607
The question is: Will you find something
that is scientifically significant?

00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:39.601
And to help with that, I'm going to add
a fourth part to our formula,

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:40.802
which is this:

00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:44.891
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.

00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:46.886
(Laughter)

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.265
It's not that I don't like
other paleontologists.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.814
When you go to a place
that's relatively unexplored,

00:05:51.838 --> 00:05:54.652
you have a much better chance
of not only finding fossils

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:57.185
but of finding something
that's new to science.

00:05:57.788 --> 00:05:59.899
So that's my formula
for finding dinosaurs,

00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:01.956
and I've applied it all around the world.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.308
In the austral summer of 2004,

00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:06.157
I went to the bottom of South America,

00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:08.298
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,

00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:10.575
to prospect for dinosaurs:

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.972
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,

00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:15.199
in a desert,

00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:18.485
a place that had been barely visited
by paleontologists.

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.469
And we found this.

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:23.319
This is a femur, a thigh bone,

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:25.712
of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:28.570
That bone is 2.2 meters across.

00:06:28.594 --> 00:06:30.683
That's over seven feet long.

00:06:31.807 --> 00:06:33.907
Now, unfortunately,
that bone was isolated.

00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:36.970
We dug and dug and dug,
and there wasn't another bone around.

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:39.689
But it made us hungry to go back
the next year for more.

00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:42.316
And on the first day
of that next field season,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.709
I found this: another two-meter femur,

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:47.376
only this time not isolated,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.495
this time associated with 145 other bones

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.319
of a giant plant eater.

00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:57.160
And after three more hard,
really brutal field seasons,

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:59.136
the quarry came to look like this.

00:06:59.597 --> 00:07:03.715
And there you see the tail
of that great beast wrapping around me.

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:07.291
The giant that lay in this grave,
the new species of dinosaur,

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:11.013
we would eventually call
"Dreadnoughtus schrani."

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:14.509
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
from snout to tail.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.708
It stood two-and-a-half stories
at the shoulder,

00:07:18.217 --> 00:07:22.401
and all fleshed out in life,
it weighed 65 tons.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.872
People ask me sometimes,
"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:29.680
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.709
Now, one of the really cool things
about being a paleontologist

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:36.502
is when you find a new species,
you get to name it.

00:07:36.526 --> 00:07:40.360
And I've always thought it a shame
that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs

00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:44.863
are too often portrayed as passive,
lumbering platters of meat

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:46.132
on the landscape.

00:07:46.156 --> 00:07:47.282
(Laughter)

00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:48.884
They're not.

00:07:48.908 --> 00:07:51.927
Big herbivores can be surly,
and they can be territorial --

00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:56.474
you do not want to mess with a hippo
or a rhino or a water buffalo.

00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.822
The bison in Yellowstone injure
far more people than do the grizzly bears.

00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:06.987
So can you imagine a big bull,
65-ton Dreadnoughtus

00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:08.714
in the breeding season,

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.238
defending a territory?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.310
That animal would have been
incredibly dangerous,

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:18.055
a menace to all around, and itself
would have had nothing to fear.

00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:20.732
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"

00:08:20.756 --> 00:08:22.457
or, "fears nothing."

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:25.213
Now, to grow so large,

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:27.849
an animal like Dreadnoughtus
would've had to have been

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.030
a model of efficiency.

00:08:29.054 --> 00:08:32.817
That long neck and long tail help it
radiate heat into the environment,

00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:35.379
passively controlling its temperature.

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:38.908
And that long neck also serves
as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.

00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:41.712
Dreadnoughtus could stand
in one place and with that neck

00:08:41.736 --> 00:08:44.028
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,

00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:47.966
taking in tens of thousands of calories
while expending very few.

00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.921
And these animals evolved
a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:54.760
giving them immense stability,

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:59.701
because when you're 65 tons,
when you're literally as big as a house,

00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:01.832
the penalty for falling over

00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:03.013
is death.

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.582
Yeah, these animals are big and tough,

00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:07.383
but they won't take a blow like that.

00:09:07.407 --> 00:09:09.988
Dreadnoughtus falls over,
ribs break and pierce lungs.

00:09:10.012 --> 00:09:11.537
Organs burst.

00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:13.347
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,

00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:15.948
you don't get to fall down
in life -- even once.

00:09:17.664 --> 00:09:21.230
Now, after this particular
Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried

00:09:21.254 --> 00:09:25.974
and de-fleshed by a multitude
of bacteria, worms and insects,

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.163
its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,

00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:30.203
exchanging molecules with the groundwater

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:32.845
and becoming more and more
like the entombing rock.

00:09:33.603 --> 00:09:35.979
As layer upon layer
of sediment accumulated,

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:38.829
pressure from all sides
weighed in like a stony glove

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:44.478
whose firm and enduring grip held
each bone in a stabilizing embrace.

00:09:45.654 --> 00:09:47.304
And then came the long ...

00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:49.273
nothing.

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:53.186
Epoch after epoch of sameness,

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.154
nonevents without number.

00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:58.923
All the while, the skeleton lay
everlasting and unchanging

00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:01.310
in perfect equilibrium

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:03.047
within its rocky grave.

00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:06.012
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.

00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:08.683
The dinosaurs would reign
for another 12 million years

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:12.971
before their hegemony was snuffed out
in a fiery apocalypse.

00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:16.220
The continents drifted. The mammals rose.

00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:17.615
The Ice Age came.

00:10:18.623 --> 00:10:20.870
And then, in East Africa,

00:10:20.894 --> 00:10:26.506
an unpromising species of ape
evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:31.204
These brainy primates were not
particularly fast or strong.

00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:34.268
But they excelled at covering ground,

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.161
and in a remarkable diaspora

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:39.327
surpassing even the dinosaurs' record
of territorial conquest,

00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:41.281
they dispersed across the planet,

00:10:41.305 --> 00:10:44.485
ravishing every ecosystem
they encountered,

00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:47.690
along the way, inventing culture
and metalworking and painting

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.056
and dance and music

00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:51.000
and science

00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:56.322
and rocket ships that would eventually
take 12 particularly excellent apes

00:10:56.346 --> 00:10:58.197
to the surface of the Moon.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.539
With seven billion peripatetic
Homo sapiens on the planet,

00:11:05.253 --> 00:11:06.470
it was perhaps inevitable

00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:10.532
that one of them would eventually
trod on the grave of the magnificent titan

00:11:10.556 --> 00:11:13.508
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.

00:11:14.614 --> 00:11:15.865
I was that ape.

00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:19.981
And standing there, alone in the desert,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.791
it was not lost on me

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:25.445
that the chance of any one individual
entering the fossil record

00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:27.142
is vanishingly small.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:30.087
But the Earth is very, very old.

00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:34.371
And over vast tracts of time,
the improbable becomes the probable.

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:37.086
That's the magic of the geological record.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.292
Thus, multitudinous creatures
living and dying on an old planet

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:42.243
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:43.909
each one a small miracle,

00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:47.224
but collectively, inevitable.

00:11:48.572 --> 00:11:51.445
Sixty-six million years ago,
an asteroid hits the Earth

00:11:51.953 --> 00:11:53.636
and wipes out the dinosaurs.

00:11:54.771 --> 00:11:56.699
This easily might not have been.

00:11:57.312 --> 00:12:00.167
But we only get one history,
and it's the one that we have.

00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.467
But this particular reality
was not inevitable.

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:05.293
The tiniest perturbation
of that asteroid far from Earth

00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:08.318
would have caused it to miss
our planet by a wide margin.

00:12:08.754 --> 00:12:12.107
The pivotal, calamitous day during which
the dinosaurs were wiped out,

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.342
setting the stage
for the modern world as we know it

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:16.898
didn't have to be.

00:12:16.922 --> 00:12:18.887
It could've just been another day --

00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:20.784
a Thursday, perhaps --

00:12:21.856 --> 00:12:26.783
among the 63 billion days
already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:28.698
But over geological time,

00:12:28.722 --> 00:12:31.607
improbable, nearly impossible events

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.782
do occur.

00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:35.729
Along the path from our wormy,
Cambrian ancestors

00:12:35.753 --> 00:12:38.156
to primates dressed in suits,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.061
innumerable forks in the road
led us to this very particular reality.

00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:48.074
The bones of Dreadnoughtus
lay underground for 77 million years.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.070
Who could have imagined

00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:53.058
that a single species of shrew-like mammal

00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:55.126
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.202
would evolve into sentient beings

00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:59.582
capable of characterizing
and understanding

00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:02.613
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?

00:13:04.775 --> 00:13:07.798
I once stood at the head
of the Missouri River

00:13:09.107 --> 00:13:10.488
and bestraddled it.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.325
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water

00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:17.960
that issues forth from beneath a rock
in a boulder in a pasture,

00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:19.681
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.

00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:22.557
The stream next to it
runs a few hundred yards

00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:24.859
and ends in a small pond.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.867
Those two streams -- they look identical.

00:13:29.732 --> 00:13:32.271
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,

00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:34.564
and the other is the Missouri River.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:39.164
Now go down to the mouth
of the Missouri, near St. Louis,

00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:41.905
and it's pretty obvious
that that river is a big deal.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.354
But go up into the Bitterroots
and look at the Missouri,

00:13:45.378 --> 00:13:49.848
and human prospection does not
allow us to see it as anything special.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.984
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period

00:13:53.008 --> 00:13:55.453
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.

00:13:55.477 --> 00:13:56.914
You would never guess

00:13:56.938 --> 00:13:59.015
that they would amount
to anything special,

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.687
and they probably wouldn't have,

00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:02.948
were it not for that pesky asteroid.

00:14:03.797 --> 00:14:07.158
Now, make a thousand more worlds
and a thousand more solar systems

00:14:07.182 --> 00:14:08.468
and let them run.

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:11.201
You will never get the same result.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:14.630
No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:17.962
but they would not be our world
and they would not have our history.

00:14:17.986 --> 00:14:20.965
There are an infinite number of histories
that we could've had.

00:14:20.989 --> 00:14:23.515
We only get one, and wow,
did we ever get a good one.

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:26.377
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.

00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:30.423
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:35.312
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
and pill bugs the length of a car

00:14:35.336 --> 00:14:36.899
really existed.

00:14:39.192 --> 00:14:40.795
Why study the ancient past?

00:14:42.652 --> 00:14:44.319
Because it gives us perspective

00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:46.319
and humility.

00:14:46.977 --> 00:14:50.409
The dinosaurs died in the world's
fifth mass extinction,

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:54.201
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.

00:14:55.114 --> 00:14:58.573
They didn't see it coming,
and they didn't have a choice.

00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:03.475
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

00:15:03.943 --> 00:15:07.934
And the nature of the fossil record
tells us that our place on this planet

00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.757
is both precarious
and potentially fleeting.

00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:14.895
Right now, our species is propagating
an environmental disaster

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:18.502
of geological proportions
that is so broad and so severe,

00:15:18.526 --> 00:15:21.151
it can rightly be called
the sixth extinction.

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:24.245
Only unlike the dinosaurs,

00:15:25.128 --> 00:15:26.619
we can see it coming.

00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:29.111
And unlike the dinosaurs,

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:31.444
we can do something about it.

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.815
That choice is ours.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.641
Thank you.

00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:48.763
(Applause)
