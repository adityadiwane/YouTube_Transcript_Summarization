00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.629
Isadora Duncan --

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.527
(Music) --

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:21.650
crazy, long-legged woman
from San Francisco,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.369
got tired of this country,
and she wanted to get out.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.934
Isadora was famous
somewhere around 1908

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:37.299
for putting up a blue curtain,

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.504
and she would stand

00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:42.753
with her hands over her solar plexus

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.981
and she would wait,

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:49.271
and she would wait,

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:53.450
and then, she would move.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.371
(Music)

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:27.527
Josh and I and Somi call this piece

00:01:27.527 --> 00:01:32.424
"The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain."

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:39.508
Red circle.

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.356
Blue curtain.

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:45.629
But,

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:55.372
this is not the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:01:55.372 --> 00:02:00.240
This is a morning in Vancouver

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.614
in 2015.

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:09.603
(Music)

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:42.154
(Singing)

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:28.365
Come on, Josh!

00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:33.530
(Music)

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:55.092
(Singing)

00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:08.432
Go!

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:27.140
Are we there yet?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.340
I don't think so.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.449
Hey, yeah!

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.975
(Music)

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:51.756
What time is it?

00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:53.428
(Music)

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:56.111
Where are we?

00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:01.140
Josh.

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:06.251
Somi.

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.587
Bill T.

00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:10.805
Josh.

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:15.962
Somi.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:21.788
Bill T.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.914
(Applause)

00:06:20.457 --> 00:06:24.457
Yeah, yeah!
