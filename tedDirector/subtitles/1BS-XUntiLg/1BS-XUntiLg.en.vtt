00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Trees epitomize stasis.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
for many human generations,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
but if we shift our perspective

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
from the trunk to the twigs,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
trees become very dynamic entities,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
moving and growing.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And I decided to explore this movement

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
by turning trees into artists.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and that produced art.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
The piece of art you see on your left

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
is painted by a western red cedar

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and that on your right by a Douglas fir,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and what I learned was that different species

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But I was also interested in the movement of trees

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I simply measured and summed

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
each of those lines.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and the number of branches per tree

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And so I was able to calculate

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
how far a single tree moved in a single year.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
You might have a guess.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
The answer is actually 186,540 miles,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
or seven times around the globe.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to the many dynamic twigs,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
but rather extremely dynamic.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And I began to think about ways that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
we might consider this lesson of trees,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
but which cry for change and dynamicism,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and one of those entities is our prisons.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
are stuck, confined behind bars.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And our prison system itself is stuck.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
The United States has over 2.3 million

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
incarcerated men and women.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
That number is rising.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
60 will return to prison.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Funds for education, for training

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and for rehabilitation are declining,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
I decided to ask whether the lesson

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I had learned from trees as artists

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
could be applied to a static institution

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
such as our prisons,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and I think the answer is yes.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
In the year 2007,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I started a partnership

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
with the Washington State Department of Corrections.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
sustainability and conservation projects

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
to four state prisons.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We give science lectures,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
instead of watching television or weightlifting.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
That, I think, is movement.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
to grow endangered prairie plants

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
That, I think, is movement.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
for later release into protected wetlands.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
That, I think, is movement.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And just recently, we've begun to work with

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
those men who are segregated

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in what we call Supermax facilities.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
They've incurred violent infractions

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
by becoming violent with guards

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and with other prisoners.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
They're kept in bare cells like this

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
for 23 hours a day.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
they're placed in immobile booths like this.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
For one hour a day

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and frogs into these environments,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
we are bringing images of nature

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
into these exercise yards,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
with visual images of nature.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and he's providing input on the types of images

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
more serene, more calm,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
less apt to violence.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And so what we see, I think,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
is that small, collective movements of change

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
can perhaps move

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
an entity such as our own prison system

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
in a direction of hope.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
We know that trees are static entities

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
when we look at their trunks.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
But if trees can create art,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
then perhaps there are other static entities

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that we hold inside ourselves,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
like grief, like addictions,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
like racism,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that can also change.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Applause)
