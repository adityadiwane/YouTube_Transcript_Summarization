00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.896
I've been at MIT for 44 years.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.856
I went to TED I.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.736
There's only one other person here,
I think, who did that.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.976
All the other TEDs --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.256
and I went to them all,
under Ricky's regime --

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.816
I talked about
what the Media Lab was doing,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.856
which today has almost 500 people in it.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.296
And if you read the press,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.976
last week it actually said
I quit the Media Lab.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.176
I didn't quit the Media Lab,
I stepped down as chairman --

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.896
which was a kind of ridiculous title,
but someone else has taken it on --

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.111
and one of the things
you can do as a professor

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:58.976
is you stay on as a professor.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.256
And I will now do for the rest of my life
the One Laptop Per Child,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.296
which I've sort of been doing
for a year and a half, anyway.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.056
So I'm going to tell you about this,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.176
use my 18 minutes
to tell you why we're doing it,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.376
how we're doing it
and then what we're doing.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.696
And at some point I'll even pass around

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.640
what the $100 laptop might be like.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.656
I was asked by Chris
to talk about some of the big issues,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.936
and so I figured I'd start with the three
that at least drove me to do this.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.776
And the first is pretty obvious.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.456
It's amazing when you meet
a head of state, and you say,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.216
"What is your most precious
natural resource?"

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.936
They will not say "children" at first,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.215
and then when you say, "children,"
they will pretty quickly agree with you.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.256
And so that isn't very hard.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.976
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.056
Everybody agrees that whatever
the solutions are to the big problems,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.816
they include education,
sometimes can be just education

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.136
and can never be without
some element of education.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.976
So that's certainly part of it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.376
And the third
is a little bit less obvious.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.136
And that is that we all in this room
learned how to walk, how to talk,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.656
not by being taught how to talk,
or taught how to walk,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.376
but by interacting with the world,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.536
by having certain results as a consequence
of being able to ask for something,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.696
or being able to stand up and reach it.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.976
Whereas at about the age six,
we were told to stop learning that way,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.336
and that all learning from then on
would happen through teaching,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.789
whether it's people standing up,
like I'm doing now,

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:38.536
or a book, or something.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.496
But it was really through teaching.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.696
And one of the things in general
that computers have provided to learning

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.856
is that it now includes a kind of learning

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.976
which is a little bit more
like walking and talking,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.616
in the sense that a lot of it is driven
by the learner himself or herself.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.376
So with those as the principles --

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.416
some of you may know Seymour Papert.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.976
This is back in 1982,
when we were working in Senegal.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.245
Because some people think that
the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.456
or two years ago,
or we were struck by lightning --

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.536
this actually has gone back a long time,
and in fact, back to the '60s.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.096
Here we're in the '80s.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.376
Steve Jobs had given us some laptops.
We were in Senegal.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.656
It didn't scale

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.776
but it at least was bringing computers
to developing countries

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.256
and learning pretty quickly
that these kids,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280
even though English wasn't their language,

00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:40.536
the Latin alphabet
barely was their language,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.896
but they could just swim like fish.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.680
They could play these like pianos.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.576
A little bit more recently,
I got involved personally.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.336
And these are two anecdotes --

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.976
one was in Cambodia,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.416
in a village that has no electricity,
no water, no television, no telephone,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.576
but has broadband Internet now.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.096
And these kids,
their first English word is "Google"

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.456
and they only know Skype.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.096
They've never heard of telephony.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.256
They just use Skype.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.136
And they go home at night --

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.976
they've got a broadband connection
in a hut that doesn't have electricity.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.762
The parents love it,
because when they open up the laptops,

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:21.976
it's the brightest light source
in the house.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.376
And talk about
where metaphors and reality mix --

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.000
this is the actual school.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.656
In parallel with this,
Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.176
to legislate one laptop per child
in the year 2002.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.296
Now at the time, I think it's fair to say
that 80 percent of the teachers were --

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.896
let me say, apprehensive.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.736
Really, they were actually against it.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.284
And they really preferred
that the money would be used

00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:52.696
for higher salaries,
more schools, whatever.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.976
And now, three and a half
years later, guess what?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.216
They're reporting five things:
drop of truancy to almost zero,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.165
attending parent-teacher meetings --

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.696
which nobody did
and now almost everybody does --

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.616
drop in discipline problems,
increase in student participation.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.056
Teachers are now saying
it's kind of fun to teach.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.216
Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! --

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.696
and then the fifth,
which interests me the most,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.936
is that the servers have to be turned off
at certain times at night

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.376
because the teachers
are getting too much email

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.376
from the kids asking them for help.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.176
So when you see that kind of thing --

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.248
this is not something
that you have to test.

00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:33.976
The days of pilot projects are over,
when people say,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.056
"We'd like to do three or four thousand
in our country to see how it works."

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.176
Screw you. Go to the back of the line
and someone else will do it,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.736
and then when you figure out
that this works, you can join as well.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.336
And this is what we're doing.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.496
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.496
So, One Laptop Per Child
was formed about a year and a half ago.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.416
It's a nonprofit association.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.376
It raised about 20 million dollars

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.216
to do the engineering
to just get this built,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.896
and then have it produced afterwards.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.176
Scale is truly important.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.496
And it's not important because you can
buy components at a lower price, OK?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.396
It's because you can go
to a manufacturer --

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.062
and I will leave the name out --

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:22.616
but we wanted a small display,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.416
doesn't have to have
perfect color uniformity.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.802
It can even have a pixel or two missing.

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:31.376
It doesn't have to be that bright.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.696
And this particular manufacturer said,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.863
"We're not interested in that.
We're interested in the living room.

00:06:36.887 --> 00:06:39.056
We're interested
in perfect color uniformity.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.416
We're interested in big displays,
bright displays.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.216
You're not part of our strategic plan."

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.955
And I said, "That's kind of too bad,
because we need 100 million units a year."

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.550
(Laughter)

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:53.536
And they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could
become part of your strategic plan."

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.976
And that's why scale counts.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.256
And that's why we will not launch this

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.176
without five to 10 million units
in the first run.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.176
And the idea is
to launch with enough scale

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.776
that the scale itself
helps bring the price down,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.696
and that's why I said
seven to 10 million there.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.136
And we're doing it
without a sales-and-marketing team.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.736
I mean, you're looking
at the sales-and-marketing team.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.776
We will do it by going
to seven large countries

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.324
and getting them to agree and launch it,

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:26.656
and then the others can follow.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.536
We have partners.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.560
It's not hard to guess
Google would be one.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:34.216
The others are all playing to pending.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.096
And this has been
in the press a great deal.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.016
It's the so-called Green Machine
that we introduced with Kofi Annan

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.336
in November at the World Summit
that was held in Tunisia.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.976
Now once people start looking at this,
they say, "Ah, this is a laptop project."

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.296
Well, no, it's not a laptop project.
It's an education project.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.976
And the fun part --
and I'm quite focused on it --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.096
I tell people I used to be a light bulb,
but now I'm a laser --

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.216
I'm just going to get that thing built,
and it turns out it's not so hard.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.456
Because laptop economics
are the following:

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.976
I say 50 percent here --
it's more like 60,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.056
60 percent of the cost of your laptop

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.936
is sales, marketing,
distribution and profit.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.296
Now we have none of those, OK?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.256
None of those figure into our cost,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.496
because first of all, we sell it at cost,
and the governments distribute it.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.776
It gets distributed
to the school system like a textbook.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.936
So that piece disappears.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.776
Then you have display and everything else.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.656
Now the display on your laptop costs,

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.816
in rough numbers,
10 dollars a diagonal inch.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.976
That can drop to eight;
it can drop to seven

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.976
but it's not going to drop to two,
or to one and a half,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.760
unless we do some pretty clever things.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.256
It's the rest -- that little brown box --
that is pretty fascinating,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.696
because the rest of your laptop
is devoted to itself.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.336
It's a little bit like an obese person

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.496
having to use most of their energy
to move their obesity.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.976
(Laughter)

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.776
And we have a situation today
which is incredible.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.776
I've been using laptops
since their inception.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.136
And my laptop runs slower,
less reliably and less pleasantly

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.696
than it ever has before.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.216
And this year is worse.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.616
(Applause)

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.936
People clap, sometimes
you even get standing ovations,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.656
and I say, "What the hell's wrong
with you? Why are we all sitting there?"

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.016
And somebody -- to remain nameless --
called our laptop a "gadget" recently.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.656
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go
like a bat out of hell.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.876
When you open it up,
it's going to go 'bing.'"

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.176
It'll be on.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.976
It'll be just like it was in 1985,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.696
when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.456
It worked really well.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.576
And we've been going steadily downhill.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.536
Now, people ask all the time what it is.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.616
That's what it is.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.936
The two pieces that are probably notable:
it'll be a mesh network,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.576
so when the kids open up their laptops,
they all become a network,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.416
and then just need
one or two points of backhaul.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.616
You can serve a couple of thousand kids
with two megabits.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.696
So you really can bring into a village,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.016
and then the villages
can connect themselves,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.096
and you really can do it quite well.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.096
The dual mode display --

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.816
the idea is to have a display
that both works outdoors --

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.256
isn't it fun using your cell phone
outdoors in the sunlight?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.816
Well, you can't see it.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.016
And one of the reasons you can't see it

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.096
is because it's backlighting
most of the time, most cell phones.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.776
Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one
that will be both frontlit and backlit.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.576
And whether you manually switch it
or you do it in the software

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.096
is to be seen.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.976
But when it's backlit, it's color.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.056
And when it's frontlit,
it's black and white

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.056
at three times the resolution.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.536
Is it all worked out? No.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.816
That's why a lot of our people are
more or less living in Taiwan right now.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.056
And in about 30 days,
we'll know for sure whether this works.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.296
Probably the most important piece there

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.456
is that the kids
really can do the maintenance.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.616
And this is again something
that people don't believe,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.307
but I really think it's quite true.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.776
That's the machine we showed in Tunis.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.576
This is more the direction
that we're going to go.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.936
And it's something
that we didn't think was possible.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.296
Now, I'm going to pass this around.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.496
This isn't a design, OK?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.216
So this is just a mechanical
engineering sort of embodiment of it

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.776
for you to play with.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.656
And it's clearly just a model.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.376
The working one is at MIT.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.256
I'm going to pass it
to this handsome gentleman.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.736
At least you can decide
whether it goes left or --

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.060
Chris Anderson: Before you do it,
for the people down in simulcast --

00:12:13.084 --> 00:12:16.146
Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.
CA: Just show it off a bit.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.176
So wherever the camera is --
OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.776
The idea was that
it would be not only a laptop,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.376
but that it could transform
into an electronic book.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.067
So it's sort of an electronic book.

00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.853
This is where when you go outside,
it's in black and white.

00:12:30.877 --> 00:12:32.656
The games buttons are missing,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.975
but it'll also be a games machine,

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:36.336
book machine.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.856
Set it up this way,
and it's a television set.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.000
Etc., etc. -- is that enough
for simulcast? OK, sorry.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.016
I'll let Jim decide
which way to send it afterwards.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.736
OK. Seven countries.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.336
(Laughter)

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.416
I say "maybe" for Massachusetts,
because they actually have to do a bid.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.096
By law you've got to bid,
and so on and so forth.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.536
So I can't quite name them.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.216
In the other cases,
they don't have to do bids.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.852
They can decide --

00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:06.936
it's the federal government in each case.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.176
It's kind of agonizing,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.105
because a lot of people say,
"Let's do it at the state level,"

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:15.976
because states are more nimble
than the feds, just because of size.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.176
And yet we count.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.576
We're really dealing
with the federal government.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.936
We're really dealing
with ministries of education.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.656
And if you look at governments
around the world,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.416
ministries of education
tend to be the most conservative,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.616
and also the ones that have huge payrolls.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.016
Everybody thinks
they know about education,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.496
a lot of culture is built into it as well.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.176
It's really hard.
And so it's certainly the hard road.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.976
If you look at the countries,
they're pretty geoculturally distributed.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.496
Have they all agreed? No, not completely.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.896
Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.016
are the three that are
the most active and most agreed.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.136
We're purposely
not signing anything with anybody

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.456
until we actually have the working ones.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.136
And since I visit
each one of those countries

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.176
within at least every three months,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.336
I'm just going around the world
every three weeks.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.896
Here's sort of the schedule

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:15.120
and I put at the bottom we might give some
away free in two years at this meeting.

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:18.535
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop --

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.710
you can't do it.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.136
Well, guess what, we're not.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.216
We're coming in probably at 135,
to start, then drift down.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.696
And that's very important,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.016
because so many things hit the market
at a price and then drift up.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.536
It's kind of the loss leader,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.416
and then as soon as it looks interesting,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.096
it can't be afforded,
or it can't be scaled out.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.536
So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.336
The gray market's a big issue.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.736
And one of the ways -- just one --

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.816
but one of the ways to help
in the case of the gray market

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.376
is to make something
that is so utterly unique --

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.016
It's a little bit like the fact
that automobiles --

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.696
thousands of automobiles
are stolen every day in the United States.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.656
Not one single
post-office truck is stolen.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.896
(Laughter)

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.096
And why?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.456
Because there's no market
for post-office trucks.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.216
It looks like a post-office truck.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.717
You can spray paint it.
You can do anything you want.

00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:17.936
I just learned recently: in South Africa,
no white Volvos are stolen.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.536
Period. None. Zero.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.575
So we want to make it
very much like a white Volvo.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.576
Each government has a task force.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.216
This perhaps is less interesting,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.145
but we're trying to get the governments
to all work together

00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:33.604
and it's not easy.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.927
The economics of this
is to start with the federal governments

00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:46.933
and then later,
to subsequently go to other --

00:15:46.957 --> 00:15:48.853
whether it's child-to-child funding,

00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:53.336
so a child in this country buys one
for a child in the developing world,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.456
maybe of the same gender,
maybe of the same age.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.176
An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that
as a birthday present.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.896
I mean, there are all sorts of things
that will happen,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.816
and they'll be very, very exciting.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.835
And everybody says -- I say --
it's an education project.

00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:11.856
Are we providing the software?

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.365
The answer is:

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:15.016
The system certainly has software,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.176
but no, we're not providing
the education content.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.296
That is really done in the countries.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.396
But we are certainly constructionists.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.576
And we certainly believe
in learning by doing

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.736
and everything from Logo,
which was started in 1968,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.736
to more modern things, like Scratch,
if you've ever even heard of it,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.816
are very, very much part of it.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.683
And that's the rollout.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.119
Are we dreaming? Is this real?

00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:44.808
It actually is real.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.496
The only criticism, and people
really don't want to criticize this,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.376
because it is a humanitarian effort,
a nonprofit effort

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.216
and to criticize it
is a little bit stupid, actually.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.456
(Laughter)

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.616
But the one thing
that people could criticize was,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.204
"Great idea, but these guys can't do it."

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.976
And that could either mean these guys,
professors and so on couldn't do it,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.976
or that it's not possible.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.696
Well, on December 12, a company
called Quanta agreed to build it,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.656
and since they make about one-third
of all the laptops on the planet today,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.256
that question disappeared.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.496
So it's not a matter
of whether it's going to happen.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.736
It is going to happen.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.180
And if it comes out
at 138 dollars, so what?

00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:40.230
If it comes out six months late, so what?

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.930
That's a pretty soft landing.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.490
Thank you.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.079
(Applause)
