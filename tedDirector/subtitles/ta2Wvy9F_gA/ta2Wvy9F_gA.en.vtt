00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.662
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.552
who is under the mistaken impression

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:21.139
that this conference
is named in honor of her father.

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:22.462
(Laughter)

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.622
Who am I to contradict my baby girl?

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:29.365
As many of you know, there's something
about becoming a parent

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:33.849
that concentrates the mind
on long-term problems like climate change.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:36.869
It was the birth of my daughter
that inspired me

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:39.447
to launch this climate organization,

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:43.342
in order to counteract the excessive
polarization of this issue

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.675
in the United States,

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.152
and to find a conservative
pathway forward.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.603
Yes, folks, a Republican
climate solution is possible,

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:55.952
and you know what?

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.308
It may even be better.

00:00:58.332 --> 00:00:59.943
(Laughter)

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:01.628
Let me try to prove that to you.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.663
What we really need
is a killer app to climate policy.

00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:12.104
In the technology world, a killer app
is an application so transformative

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:13.607
that it creates its own market,

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.196
like Uber.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.847
In the climate world,

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:21.796
a killer app is a new
solution so promising

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.367
that it can break through
the seemingly insurmountable

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:27.252
barriers to progress.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:30.801
These include the psychological barrier.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:34.038
Climate advocates have long
been encouraging their fellow citizens

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:35.972
to make short-term sacrifices now

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.033
for benefits that accrue to other people

00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:41.401
in other countries 30 or 40
years in the future.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:45.728
It just doesn't fly because it runs
contrary to basic human nature.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.820
Next is the geopolitical barrier.

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:52.112
Under the current rules of global trade,

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:56.482
countries have a strong incentive
to free ride off the emissions reductions

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:57.765
of other nations,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.021
instead of strengthening
their own programs.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.603
This has been the curse

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:05.590
of every international
climate negotiations, including Paris.

00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.298
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:11.393
Even the most committed countries --

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:14.617
Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:19.362
are nowhere near reducing emissions
at the required scale and speed.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:20.854
Not even close.

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:25.128
And the partisan climate divide
is far more acute

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:27.025
here in the United States.

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:29.729
We are fundamentally stuck,

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:33.313
and that is why we need
a killer app of climate policy

00:02:33.337 --> 00:02:36.078
to break through each of these barriers.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.238
I'm convinced that the road
to climate progress in the United States

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.877
runs through the Republican Party

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.985
and the business community.

00:02:48.072 --> 00:02:50.828
So in launching
the Climate Leadership Council,

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:54.766
I started by reaching out to a who's who
of Republican elder statesmen

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.980
and business leaders,

00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.381
including James Baker and George Schultz,

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:03.525
the two most respected Republican
elder statesmen in America;

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.418
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:09.084
the two most respected
conservative economists in the country;

00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:11.201
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.194
two of the most successful
and admired business leaders.

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:16.519
Together, we co-authored

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:19.607
"The Conservative Case
For Carbon Dividends."

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.166
This represents the first time

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.781
that Republican leaders put forth

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.318
a concrete market-based climate solution.

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:29.723
(Applause)

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:30.816
Thank you.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.443
(Applause)

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.794
We presented our plan at the White House

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:38.520
two weeks after President Trump moved in.

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:43.343
Almost every leading
editorial board in the country

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:45.614
has since endorsed our plan,

00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:50.323
and Fortune 100 companies
from a wide range of industries

00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:52.698
are now getting behind it.

00:03:52.722 --> 00:03:54.683
So by now you're probably wondering,

00:03:54.707 --> 00:03:57.109
what exactly is this plan?

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:01.501
Well, our carbon dividends solution
is based on four pillars.

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:05.435
The first is a gradually
rising carbon tax.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.986
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.185
like many operating systems,
it's prone to bugs,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.402
which, in this case, are called
"market failures."

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:17.948
By far the largest is that
market prices fail to take

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:21.711
social and environmental
costs into account.

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:27.075
That means every market transaction
is based on incorrect information.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.197
This fundamental bug of capitalism,
more than any other single factor,

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:33.977
is to blame for our climate predicament.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.891
Now in theory, this should be
an easy problem to fix.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:39.281
Economists agree

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:44.093
that the best solution is to put a price
on the carbon content of fossil fuels,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.391
otherwise known as a carbon tax.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:50.143
This would discourage carbon emissions

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.487
in every single economic transaction,

00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.221
every day of the year.

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:59.591
However, a carbon tax by itself
has proven to be unpopular

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:01.283
and a political dead end.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:05.338
The answer is to return
all the money raised

00:05:05.362 --> 00:05:07.654
directly to citizens,

00:05:07.678 --> 00:05:11.029
in the form of equal monthly dividends.

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.031
This would transform
an unpopular carbon tax

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.297
into a popular and populist solution,

00:05:18.321 --> 00:05:20.145
and it would also solve

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.482
the underlying psychological barrier
that we discussed,

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:28.183
by giving everyone a concrete benefit
in the here and now.

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:31.416
And these benefits would be significant.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.182
Assuming a carbon tax rate
that starts at 40 dollars per ton,

00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:38.629
a family of four would receive
2,000 dollars per year

00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:39.884
from the get-go.

00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:42.706
According to the US Treasury Department,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.489
the bottom 70 percent of Americans
would receive more in dividends

00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:51.804
than they would pay
in increased energy prices.

00:05:51.828 --> 00:05:58.821
That means 223 million Americans
would win economically

00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:00.855
from solving climate change.

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:02.793
And that --

00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:03.872
(Applause)

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.446
is revolutionary,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.201
and could fundamentally
alter climate politics.

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:13.415
But there's another
revolutionary element here.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.919
The amount of the dividend would grow

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.304
as the carbon tax rate increases.

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:21.404
The more we protect our climate,

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.283
the more our citizens benefit.

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:25.529
This creates a positive feedback loop,

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:27.083
which is crucial,

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:31.003
because the only way we will reach
our long-term emission-reduction goals

00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:33.783
is if the carbon tax rate
goes up every year.

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.765
The third pillar of our program
is eliminating regulations

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.328
that are no longer needed

00:06:40.352 --> 00:06:43.430
once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.

00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:49.883
This is a key selling point
to Republicans and business leaders.

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:52.444
So why should we trade

00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:55.517
climate regulations for a price on carbon?

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.319
Well, let me show you.

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:02.424
Our plan would achieve nearly twice
the emissions reductions

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:06.604
of all Obama-era climate
regulations combined,

00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:10.238
and nearly three times the new baseline

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:14.419
after President Trump repeals
all of those regulations.

00:07:14.443 --> 00:07:18.206
That assumes a carbon tax
starting at 40 dollars per ton,

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.223
which translates into roughly
an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.

00:07:23.882 --> 00:07:26.391
Our plan by itself

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:29.988
would meet the high end
of America's commitment

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:32.290
under the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:33.988
and as you can see,

00:07:34.012 --> 00:07:36.998
the emissions reductions
would continue over time.

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:43.089
This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.001
based on free markets
and limited government.

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.204
We would end up with less regulation

00:07:49.228 --> 00:07:52.320
and far less pollution at the same time,

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:56.328
while helping working-class
Americans get ahead.

00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:59.590
Doesn't that sound like something
we could all support?

00:07:59.614 --> 00:08:02.047
(Applause)

00:08:05.723 --> 00:08:10.242
The fourth and final pillar of our program
is a new climate domino effect,

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.920
based on border carbon adjustments.

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:15.047
Now that may sound complicated,

00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:16.936
but it, too, is revolutionary,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.821
because it provides us
a whole new strategy

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.393
to reach a global price on carbon,

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.284
which is ultimately what we need.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:26.240
Let me show you an example.

00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:29.765
Suppose Country A adopts
a carbon dividends plan,

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:31.236
and Country B does not.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.663
Well, to level the playing field

00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:36.922
and protect the competitiveness
of its industries,

00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:40.844
Country A would tax imports from Country B

00:08:40.868 --> 00:08:42.707
based on their carbon content.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.248
Fair enough.

00:08:44.272 --> 00:08:46.416
But here's where it gets
really interesting,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.078
because the money raised at the border
would increase the dividends

00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:52.356
going to the citizens of Country A.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.552
Well, how long do you think it would take
the public in Country B to realize

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:58.508
that that money should be going to them,

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:01.522
and to push for a carbon
dividends plan in their own land?

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:03.045
Add a few more countries,

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:06.526
and we get a new climate domino effect.

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:11.626
Once one major country or region
adopts carbon dividends

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.275
with border carbon adjustments,

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:15.758
other countries are compelled
to follow suit.

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:18.694
One by one the dominoes fall.

00:09:18.718 --> 00:09:21.047
And this domino effect
could start anywhere.

00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:24.481
My preference, strongly,
is the United States,

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:27.032
but it could also start
in the United Kingdom,

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:29.264
in Germany or another European country,

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:30.816
or even in China.

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:33.842
Let's take China as an example.

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:38.410
China is committed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:40.775
but what its leaders care even more about

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:45.776
is transitioning their economy
to consumer-led economic development.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.676
Well, nothing could do more
to hasten that transition

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.979
than giving every Chinese citizen
a monthly dividend.

00:09:52.003 --> 00:09:55.524
In fact, this is the only policy solution

00:09:55.548 --> 00:09:59.190
that would enable China to meet
its environmental and economic goals

00:09:59.214 --> 00:10:00.572
at the same time.

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:03.973
That's why this is the killer app
of climate policy,

00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:07.336
because it would enable us to overcome

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.673
each of the barriers we discussed earlier:

00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:12.781
the psychological barrier,
the partisan barrier,

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:16.265
and, as we've just seen,
the geopolitical barrier.

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:20.267
All we need is a country to lead the way.

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:22.720
And one method of finding
what you're looking for

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:24.404
is to take out an ad.

00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:26.407
So let's read this one together.

00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:30.241
Wanted: country to pioneer
carbon dividends plan.

00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:32.124
Cost to country: zero.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.011
Starting date: as soon as possible.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:38.477
Advantages: most effective
climate solution,

00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.258
popular and populist,

00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:42.124
pro-growth and pro-business,

00:10:42.148 --> 00:10:45.490
shrinks government
and helps the working class.

00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:52.418
Additional compensation: gratitude
of current and future generations,

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:55.626
including my daughter.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.183
Thank you.

00:10:57.207 --> 00:11:04.207
(Applause)

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:06.707
Chris Anderson: Just one
question for you, Ted.

00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:10.371
I'm actually not sure

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:13.273
I've seen a conservative
get a standing O at TED before that.

00:11:13.317 --> 00:11:14.745
That's pretty cool.

00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:17.379
The logic seems really powerful,

00:11:17.404 --> 00:11:19.473
but some people you talk to in politics

00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:23.569
say it's hard to imagine this
still getting through Congress.

00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:25.807
How are you feeling
about momentum behind this?

00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:29.756
Ted Halstead: So I understand
that many are very pessimistic

00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:32.830
about what's happening in
the United States with President Trump.

00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:34.432
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.

00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:37.462
The actions of this White House,
the early actions on climate,

00:11:37.487 --> 00:11:43.066
are just the first move
in a complex game of climate chess.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.700
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:48.574
the pressure is going to mount 
for a replacement program,

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:49.845
which is where we come in.

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:53.067
And there are three reasons why,
which I'll go through real quickly.

00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:56.303
One, the business community
is fundamentally parting ways

00:11:56.328 --> 00:11:58.763
with the White House on climate change.

00:11:58.788 --> 00:11:59.938
In fact, we're finding

00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:03.073
a number of Fortune 100 companies
supporting our program.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.296
Within two months,
we're going to be announcing

00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:08.376
some really surprising names
coming out in favor of this program.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.532
Two, there is no issue
in American politics

00:12:11.557 --> 00:12:15.366
where there's a more fundamental gap
between the Republican base

00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:18.026
and the Republican leadership
than climate change.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.780
And three, thinking of
this analogy of chess,

00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:27.454
the big decision up ahead is:
Does the administration stay in Paris?

00:12:27.478 --> 00:12:29.065
Well, let's pan it out both ways.

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:32.835
If it stays in Paris, as many
are pushing for in the administration,

00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:35.462
well then that begs a question:
What's the plan?

00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:36.795
We have the plan.

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:39.119
But if they don't stay in Paris,

00:12:39.144 --> 00:12:41.596
the international pressure
will be overwhelming.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.246
Our Secretary of State will be asking
other countries for NATO contributions,

00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:48.172
and they'll be saying,
"No, give us our Paris commitment.

00:12:48.197 --> 00:12:51.109
Come through on your commitments,
we'll come through on ours."

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:54.427
So, international, business
and even the Republican base

00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:58.216
will all be calling for
a Republican replacement plan.

00:12:58.397 --> 00:13:01.089
And, hopefully, we've provided one.

00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:02.637
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.

00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:03.812
TH: Thank you, Chris.

00:13:03.837 --> 00:13:07.399
