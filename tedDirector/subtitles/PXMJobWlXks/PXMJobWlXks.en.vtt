00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
It's a bit funny to be

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
at a conference dedicated to things not seen,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and present my proposal to build

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
a 6,000-kilometer-long wall

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
across the entire African continent.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
About the size of the Great Wall of China,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
this would hardly be an invisible structure.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
bacteria and grains of sand.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I only believe in opportunities.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Which is why I'll show you a threat,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and an architectural response.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
The threat is desertification.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
My response is a sandstone wall

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
made from bacteria and solidified sand,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
stretching across the desert.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Now, sand is a magical material

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
of beautiful contradictions.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
It is simple and complex.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
It is peaceful and violent.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
It is always the same, never the same,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
endlessly fascinating.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
One billion grains of sand

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
come into existence in the world each second.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
That's a cyclical process.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
As rocks and mountains die,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
grains of sand are born.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Some of those grains may then accumulate

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
on a massive scale,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
into a sand dune.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
In a way, the static, stone mountain

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
becomes a moving mountain of sand.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Some are already deserts;

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
others are being seriously degraded by the sand.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
The name means "edge of the desert."

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that major droughts brought three million people

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
to become dependent upon emergency food aid,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
with about up to 250,000 dying.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And it's one that gets very little attention.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
In our accelerated media culture,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
desertification is simply too slow

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
to reach the headlines.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.260
too few crying children and smashed up houses.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And yet desertification

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
is a major threat on all continents,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
affecting some 110 countries

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
It seriously threatens the livelihoods

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of millions of people,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and especially in Africa and China.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
through unsustainable use of scarce resources.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So, we get climate change.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.260
We get droughts,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
increased desertification,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
crashing food systems, water scarcity,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
famine, forced migration,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
political instability, warfare, crisis.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
That's a potential scenario

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
if we fail to take this seriously.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
But, how far away is it?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to try and find out how far away it is.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.260
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
physically pushing people away from their homes.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
(Laughter)

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
with the elders in Gidan-Kara,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
a tiny village outside of Sokoto.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
They had to move this village in 1987

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
This is where the village used to be.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
That's the kind of forced migration

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
that desertification can lead to.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
If you happen to live close to the desert border,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
before you have to carry your kids away,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and abandon your home and your life as you know it.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And still, those extreme environments are very good places

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
if we want to stop the shifting sands.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Four years ago, 23 African countries

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
A fantastic project, the initial plan

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
right across the African continent,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
from avalanching over its crest.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
is to use some kind of sand catcher.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Trees or cacti are good for this.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
the people in these regions are so poor

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
that they chop them down for firewood.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and hoping that they won't get chopped down.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
It adds roughness to the dune's surface,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
It provides a physical support structure for the trees,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and it creates physical spaces,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
If people live inside of the green barrier

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and from some of the forces of nature.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Inside of the dunes we find shade.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
We can start harvesting condensation,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and start greening the desert from within.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and then excavate the sand,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and we have our architecture.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
We can either excavate it by hand

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
or we can have the wind excavate it for us.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But, by now, you're probably asking,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
How do we glue those grains of sand together?

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Bacillus pasteurii,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and marshes, and does precisely that.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
It takes a pile of loose sand

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and it creates sandstone out of it.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.260
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
A chemical process produces calcite,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
which is a kind of natural cement

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
that binds the grains together.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.260
working with the bugs at UCL in London,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
trying to solidify them.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, how much would this cost?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I'm not an economist, very much not,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
(Laughter)

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
which you'll never have to pay again,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
one cubic meter of bacterial sand

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
would be about 11 dollars.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
How do we construct something like this?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Well, I'll quickly show you two options.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.260
fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.260
pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Then, a few years afterwards,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
using permacultural strategies,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
we green that part of the desert.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
The second alternative would be to use injection piles.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and we create an initial bacterial surface.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
We then pull the piles up through the dune

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
But, what should they look like?

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
with good spatial qualities,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Now, part of the formal control over this structure

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
would be lost to nature, obviously,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
as the bacteria do their work.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
I think there is really something in that articulation

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
that is quite nice.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
We see the result, the traces, if you like,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
into these habitable environments.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Some people believe that

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
this would spread uncontrollably,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
That's not true at all.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
So, there it is --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
architectural anti-desertification structures

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
made from the desert itself.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
by the end of the century.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.260
In a period of unprecedented population growth

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.260
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.260
If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
But, if I had something like a TED wish,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
it would be to actually get it built,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
to start building this habitable wall,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.260
built into the dunescape itself.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
It's not only something that supports trees,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
but something that connects people and countries together.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.260
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Borges said that "nothing is built on stone,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
everything is built on sand,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.260
but we must build as if the sand were stone."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.260
political, practical, ethical, financial.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.260
My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
is fraught with many challenges

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and difficulties in the real world.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260
As Borges would have it, it's the sand.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And I think now is really the time

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
to turn it into stone. Thank you.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
