00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
That's what I do in life -- telling stories,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
writing novels --

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and today I would like to tell you a few stories

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
about the art of storytelling

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and also some supernatural creatures

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
called the djinni.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
glimpses of my personal story.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I will do so with the help of words, of course,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
but also a geometrical shape, the circle,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
so throughout my talk,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
you will come across several circles.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I was born in Strasbourg, France

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to Turkish parents.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Shortly after, my parents got separated,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and I came to Turkey with my mom.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
From then on, I was raised

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
as a single child by a single mother.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that was a bit unusual.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Our neighborhood was full of large families,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
where fathers were the heads of households,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
in a patriarchal environment.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
In fact, I grew up observing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
two different kinds of womanhood.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
On the one hand was my mother,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
On the other hand was my grandmother,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
who also took care of me

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and was more spiritual, less educated

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and definitely less rational.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and melted lead into mysterious shapes

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
to fend off the evil eye.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Many people visited my grandmother,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
people with severe acne on their faces

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
or warts on their hands.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
take a red apple and stab it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
with as many rose thorns

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
as the number of warts she wanted to remove.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Then one by one, she would

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
encircle these thorns with dark ink.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
A week later, the patient would come back

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
for a follow-up examination.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
in front of an audience of scholars and scientists,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
but the truth is, of all the people

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I did not see anyone go back

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
unhappy or unhealed.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
but also beware of the power of circles."

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
From her, I learned, amongst many other things,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
one very precious lesson --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
that if you want to destroy something in this life,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
be it an acne, a blemish

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
or the human soul,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It will dry up inside.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We all do.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
But if we have no connection whatsoever

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
then we too run the risk

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of drying up inside.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Our imagination might shrink;

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
our hearts might dwindle,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and our humanness might wither

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
if we stay for too long

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
inside our cultural cocoons.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
if all the people in our inner circle resemble us,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
it means we are surrounded

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
with our mirror image.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
is to cover mirrors with velvet

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
It's an old Eastern tradition

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
based on the knowledge that it's not healthy

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
for a human being to spend too much time

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
staring at his own reflection.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
is one of the greatest dangers

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of today's globalized world.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And it's happening everywhere,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
among liberals and conservatives,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
East and West alike.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
We tend to form clusters

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
based on similarity,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and then we produce stereotypes

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
about other clusters of people.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
In my opinion, one way of transcending

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
these cultural ghettos

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
is through the art of storytelling.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Stories cannot demolish frontiers,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
but they can punch holes in our mental walls.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and sometimes even like what we see.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
I started writing fiction at the age of eight.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
about my sanity.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
except I told this to imaginary friends around me,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
which was not so good.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I was an introverted child,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
to the point of communicating with colored crayons

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and apologizing to objects

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
when I bumped into them,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
so my mother thought it might do me good

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
to write down my day-to-day experiences

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and emotions.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and the last thing I wanted to do

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
was to write about myself.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Instead, I began to write about people other than me

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and things that never really happened.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And thus began my life-long passion

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
for writing fiction.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
So from the very beginning, fiction for me

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
was less of an autobiographical manifestation

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
than a transcendental journey

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
into other lives, other possibilities.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And please bear with me:

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Now one other thing happened around this same time.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
My mother became a diplomat.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So from this small, superstitious,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
I was zoomed into this

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
posh, international school [in Madrid],

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
where I was the only Turk.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It was here that I had my first encounter

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
with what I call the "representative foreigner."

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
yet this diversity did not necessarily lead

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
classroom democracy.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Instead, it generated an atmosphere

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
in which each child was seen --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
not as an individual on his own,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
but as the representative of something larger.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
except whenever something negative,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
with regards to a nation

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
or a religion, took place.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
The child who represented it was mocked,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
ridiculed and bullied endlessly.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
a military takeover happened in my country,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
(Laughter)

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
during those days.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
I also had my first taste

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
of cultural stereotypes there.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
The other children asked me about the movie

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and they wondered at what age

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
I would start covering my hair.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
I came to learn that these were

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
the three main stereotypes about my country:

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
politics, cigarettes

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and the veil.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and Ankara again.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Everywhere I went, I felt like

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
my imagination was the only suitcase

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I could take with me.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Stories gave me a sense of center,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
continuity and coherence,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
the city I adore.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
where I wrote several of my novels.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
in 1999.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
There was the local grocer there --

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
and didn't speak to marginals.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
He was sitting next to a transvestite

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
with a long black wig

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and mascara running down her cheeks.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
with trembling hands

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and offer one to her,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and that is the image of the night of the earthquake

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
in my mind today --

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
smoking together on the sidewalk.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
In the face of death and destruction,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
our mundane differences evaporated,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and we all became one

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
even if for a few hours.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
but when we are reading a good novel,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
we leave our small, cozy apartments behind,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
go out into the night alone

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and start getting to know people we had never met before

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and perhaps had even been biased against.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Shortly after, I went

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
as a linguistic one.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
I started writing fiction in English.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile --

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
they ask me why I do this --

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
but the commute between languages

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
gives me the chance to recreate myself.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I love writing in Turkish,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
which to me is very poetic and very emotional,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and I love writing in English, which to me

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
is very mathematical and cerebral.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So I feel connected to each language in a different way.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
For me, like millions of other people

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
around the world today,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
English is an acquired language.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
When you're a latecomer to a language,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
what happens is you live there

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
with a continuous

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and perpetual frustration.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
crack better jokes, say better things,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but we end up saying less

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And that gap is very intimidating.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
But if we manage not to be frightened by it,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
it's also stimulating.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And this is what I discovered in Boston --

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that frustration was very stimulating.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.260
At this stage, my grandmother,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
who had been watching the course of my life

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
with increasing anxiety,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
started to include in her daily prayers

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that I urgently get married

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
so that I could settle down once and for all.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And because God loves her, I did get married.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
(Laughter)

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
But instead of settling down,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
I went to Arizona.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And since my husband is in Istanbul,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul --

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
the two places on the surface of earth

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that couldn't be more different.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
physically and spiritually.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Stories accompany me,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
keeping my pieces and memories together,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
like an existential glue.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Yet as much as I love stories,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
recently, I've also begun to think

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that they lose their magic

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
if and when a story is seen as more than a story.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And this is a subject that I would love

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
to think about together.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
When my first novel written in English came out in America,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.260
(Laughter)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I asked him what he meant by that.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
so to me, it was normal

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
that there be more international characters in it

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
than Turkish characters,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
but I understood what my critic was looking for.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And I also understood that I

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
would keep disappointing him.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
because I happened to be one.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
We often talk about how stories change the world,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
but we should also see how the world of identity politics

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
affects the way stories

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
are being circulated,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
read and reviewed.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Many authors feel this pressure,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
then you are expected to write

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
the stories of Muslim women

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and, preferably, the unhappy stories

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
of unhappy Muslim women.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
You're expected to write

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
informative, poignant and characteristic stories

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and leave the experimental and avant-garde

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
to your Western colleagues.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
is happening in the literary world today.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Writers are not seen

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
as creative individuals on their own,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
but as the representatives

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
of their respective cultures:

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
a few authors from China, a few from Turkey,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
a few from Nigeria.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
We're all thought to have something very distinctive,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
if not peculiar.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
The writer and commuter James Baldwin

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
gave an interview in 1984

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
as a gay writer,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Baldwin stopped and said,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
"But don't you see? There's nothing in me

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
that is not in everybody else,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and nothing in everybody else

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
that is not in me."

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
When identity politics tries to put labels on us,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
There's a fuzzy category called

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
multicultural literature

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
in which all authors from outside the Western world

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
are lumped together.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I never forget my first multicultural reading,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
We were three writers, one from the Philippines,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
one Turkish and one Indonesian --

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
like a joke, you know.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
(Laughter)

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And the reason why we were brought together

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
was not because we shared an artistic style

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
or a literary taste.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
It was only because of our passports.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
not so much the imaginary.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
A function is attributed to fiction.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
In this way, not only the writers themselves,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
but also their fictional characters

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
become the representatives of something larger.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
But I must quickly add

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
that this tendency to see a story

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
as more than a story

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
does not solely come from the West.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
It comes from everywhere.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And I experienced this firsthand

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
when I was put on trial in 2005

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
I had intended to write

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
a constructive, multi-layered novel

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
about an Armenian and a Turkish family

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
through the eyes of women.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
My micro story became a macro issue

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
when I was prosecuted.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Some people criticized, others praised me

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
that this was fiction.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
It was just a story.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And when I say, "just a story,"

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
I'm not trying to belittle my work.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
I want to love and celebrate fiction

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
for what it is,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
not as a means to an end.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Writers are entitled to their political opinions,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and there are good political novels out there,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
but the language of fiction

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
is not the language of daily politics.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Chekhov said,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
"The solution to a problem

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and the correct way of posing the question

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
are two completely separate things.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility."

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
The other, in nuances.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
One draws boundaries.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
The other recognizes no frontiers.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
Fiction is flowing water.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
They would go to coffee houses,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
where they would tell a story in front of an audience,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
often improvising.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
With each new person in the story,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
the meddah would change his voice,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
impersonating that character.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
Everybody could go and listen, you know --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Stories cut across all boundaries,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
which were very popular throughout the Middle East,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Today, stories continue

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
to transcend borders.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
they usually don't listen to each other,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
but a Palestinian reader

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
still reads a novel by a Jewish author,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and vice versa, connecting and empathizing

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
with the narrator.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Literature has to take us beyond.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
If it cannot take us there,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
it is not good literature.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Books have saved the introverted,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
timid child that I was -- that I once was.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
But I'm also aware of the danger

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
of fetishizing them.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
When the poet and mystic, Rumi,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
one of the first things the latter did

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
was to toss Rumi's books into water

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and watch the letters dissolve.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.260
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
is far worse than ignorance."

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
The problem with today's cultural ghettos

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
is not lack of knowledge --

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
we know a lot about each other, or so we think --

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
it makes us elitist,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
distant and disconnected.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
There's a metaphor which I love:

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
living like a drawing compass.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Meanwhile, the other leg

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
draws a wide circle, constantly moving.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
Like that, my fiction as well.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
with strong Turkish roots,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
but the other part travels the world,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
connecting to different cultures.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
as both local and universal,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
both from here and everywhere.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Now those of you who have been to Istanbul

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
have probably seen Topkapi Palace,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
which was the residence of Ottoman sultans

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
for more than 400 years.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
In the palace, just outside the quarters

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
of the favorite concubines,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
It's between buildings.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
I'm intrigued by this concept.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
We usually distrust those areas

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
that fall in between things.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
We see them as the domain

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
of supernatural creatures like the djinn,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
who are made of smokeless fire

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
and are the symbol of elusiveness.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
But my point is perhaps

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
that elusive space

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
is what writers and artists need most.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
When I write fiction

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
I cherish elusiveness and changeability.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
I like it when my characters surprise me.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
I might write about

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
a Muslim woman in one novel,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
and perhaps it will be a very happy story,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
and in my next book, I might write

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
As long as it comes from our hearts,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
we can write about anything and everything.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
Audre Lorde once said,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
"The white fathers taught us to say,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
'I think, therefore I am.'"

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
And yet, why is it that,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
in creative writing courses today,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
the very first thing we teach students is

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
"write what you know"?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
writing who we are or what we know

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
or what our identity is about.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
We should teach young people and ourselves

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
to expand our hearts

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
and write what we can feel.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
We should get out of our cultural ghetto

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
and go visit the next one and the next.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.260
drawing circles beyond circles.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
They connect all humanity,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
regardless of identity politics,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
and that is the good news.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.260
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260
"Come, let us be friends for once;

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
let us make life easy on us;

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
let us be lovers and loved ones;

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
the earth shall be left to no one."

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
Thank you.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:38.260
(Applause)
