00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going to speak

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
about a tiny, little idea.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And this is about shifting baseline.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And because the idea can be explained in one minute,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I will tell you three stories before

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to fill in the time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the first story

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And he was here, as you well know, in '35.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And you'd think he was chasing finches,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but he wasn't.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He was actually collecting fish.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And he described one of them

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
as very "common."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This was the sailfin grouper.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A big fishery was run on it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
until the '80s.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now this story,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we have heard it lots of times

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
on Galapagos and other places,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so there is nothing particular about it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We still think it is pristine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The brochures still say

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it is untouched.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So what happens here?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The second story, also to illustrate another concept,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is called shifting waistline.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Laughter)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Because I was there in '71,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
studying a lagoon in West Africa.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I was there because I grew up in Europe

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and I wanted later to work in Africa.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I thought I could blend in.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And I got a big sunburn,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and I was convinced that I was really not from there.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This was my first sunburn.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the lagoon

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
was surrounded by palm trees,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as you can see, and a few mangrove.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And it had tilapia

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
about 20 centimeters,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And the fisheries for this tilapia

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
sustained lots of fish and they had a good time

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and they earned more than average

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in Ghana.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
When I went there 27 years later,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the fish had shrunk to half of their size.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They were maturing at five centimeters.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They had been pushed genetically.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There were still fishes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They were still kind of happy.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And the fish also were happy to be there.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So nothing has changed,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but everything has changed.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
My third little story

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
is that I was an accomplice

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in the introduction of trawling

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in Southeast Asia.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Europe did lots of development projects.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Fish development

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
meant imposing on countries

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that had already 100,000 fishers

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to impose on them industrial fishing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And this boat, quite ugly,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
is called the Mutiara 4.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I went sailing on it,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we did surveys

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
throughout the southern South China sea

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and especially the Java Sea.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And what we caught,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we didn't have words for it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What we caught, I know now,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is the bottom of the sea.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And 90 percent of our catch

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
were sponges,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
other animals that are fixed on the bottom.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And actually most of the fish,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they are a little spot on the debris,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and then was thrown down.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And these pictures are extraordinary

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
because this transition is very rapid.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Within a year, you do a survey

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and then commercial fishing begins.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The bottom is transformed

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
into a muddy mess.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This is a dead turtle.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And one time we caught a live one.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It was not drowned yet.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This mountain of debris

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is actually collected by fishers

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
every time they go

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
into an area that's never been fished.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But it's not documented.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We transform the world,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but we don't remember it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We adjust our baseline

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to the new level,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we don't recall what was there.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
If you generalize this,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
something like this happens.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You have on the y axis some good thing:

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
biodiversity, numbers of orca,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the greenness of your country, the water supply.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And over time it changes --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
it changes

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
because people do things, or naturally.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Every generation

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
will use the images

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
as a standard

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and will extrapolate forward.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And the difference then,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
they perceive as a loss.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You can have a succession of changes.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
At the end you want to sustain

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
miserable leftovers.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We want to sustain things that are gone

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
or things that are not the way they were.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Now one should think

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
this problem affected people

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
certainly when in predatory societies,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
they killed animals

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and they didn't know they had done so

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
after a few generations.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Because, obviously,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
an animal that is very abundant,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
before it gets extinct,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
it becomes rare.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So you don't lose abundant animals.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You always lose rare animals.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And therefore they're not perceived

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
as a big loss.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Over time,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
we concentrate on large animals,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and in a sea that means the big fish.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They become rarer because we fish them.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Over time we have a few fish left

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and we think this is the baseline.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the question is,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
why do people accept this?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Well because they don't know that it was different.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And in fact, lots of people, scientists,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
will contest that it was really different.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And they will contest this

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
because the evidence

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
presented in an earlier mode

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is not in the way

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
they would like the evidence presented.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
For example,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
the anecdote that some present,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as Captain so-and-so

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
observed lots of fish in this area

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
cannot be used

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
because it's not "scientific."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So you have a situation

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
where people don't know the past,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
even though we live in literate societies,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
because they don't trust

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the sources of the past.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And hence, the enormous role

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that a marine protected area can play.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Because with marine protected areas,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we actually recreate the past.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
because the baseline has shifted

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and is extremely low.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
That is for people

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
who can see a marine protected area

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and who can benefit

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
from the insight that it provides,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which enables them to reset their baseline.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
How about the people who can't do that

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because they have no access --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the people in the Midwest for example?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
There I think

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that the arts and film

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
can perhaps fill the gap,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and simulation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
500 years ago.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
are like "Avatar."

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
(Laughter)

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And if you think about "Avatar,"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
if you think of why people were so touched by it --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
never mind the Pocahontas story --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
why so touched by the imagery?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Because it evokes something

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that in a sense has been lost.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And so my recommendation,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
it's the only one I will provide,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Thank you very much.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
(Applause)
