00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
a newspaper article which said

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
that one day syringes would be

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
the transmission of AIDS.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
kills approximately one million people a year.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and kills 1.3 million people a year.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
This young girl and her friend

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
that I met in an orphanage in Delhi

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.330
were HIV positive from a syringe.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And what was so sad about this particular story

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
was that once their parents had found out --

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
the parents threw them out on the street.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
And hence they ended up in an orphanage.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
And it comes from situations like this where

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
blindly giving an injection to someone.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And the injection is so valuable,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
that the people basically trust

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
between people in high-virus areas.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
This video we took undercover,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
which shows you, over a half an hour period,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
a tray of medicines of 42 vials,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
was filmed being unwrapped.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
They started with two and they ended with two.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
which is their sort of modular station,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
and dropping the syringe she's just used

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
of all injections given

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
are unsafe.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
They are lucky. They already have a job.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
from the back of hospitals,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
wash them, and in the course of this,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
for literally more money

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
giving me full assurance

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.330
In China, recycling is a major issue.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
and then put back out on the street.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
So recycling and reuse

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
are the major issues here.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
In all schools in Indonesia,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
there is usually a toy seller in the playground.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
The toy seller, in this case,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
had syringes, which they usually do,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
next door to the diggers, which is obviously

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
what you would expect.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
And they are having great fun.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
But they also drink from them

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And they squirt the water into their mouths.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.330
And these are used with traces of blood visible.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
So we need a better product. And we need better information.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.330
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
I was going to show you my invention,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
which I came up with.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
You load it up in the normal way. This is made

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
You give the injection and then put it down.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
If someone then tries to reuse it,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
it locks and breaks afterwards.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
It's very, very simple. Thank you.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
(Applause)

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And it costs the same as a normal syringe.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
And in comparison, a Coca-Cola

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
is 10 times the price.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And I have an information charity

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
which has done huge scale amount of work in India.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
And we're very proud of giving information to people,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
(Applause)
