00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.850
Imagine that you are a product designer.

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.132
And you've designed a product,

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:21.780
a new type of product,
called the human immune system.

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.626
You're pitching this product

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.807
to a skeptical, strictly
no-nonsense manager.

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:29.824
Let's call him Bob.

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:32.010
I think we all know
at least one Bob, right?

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:34.713
How would that go?

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.957
Bob, I've got this incredible idea

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.613
for a completely new type
of personal health product.

00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:42.808
It's called the human immune system.

00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:46.676
I can see from your face that
you're having some problems with this.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.776
Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.457
I don't want to take you
through the gory details,

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.709
I just want to tell you about some
of the amazing features of this product.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.662
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.818
by having millions of copies
of each component --

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.027
leukocytes, white blood cells --

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.801
before they're actually needed,

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:09.320
to create a massive buffer
against the unexpected.

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:13.636
And it cleverly leverages diversity

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.381
by having not just leukocytes
but B cells, T cells,

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.613
natural killer cells, antibodies.

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.645
The components don't really matter.

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:23.239
The point is that together,

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:27.879
this diversity of different approaches
can cope with more or less anything

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:30.056
that evolution has been able to throw up.

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.292
And the design is completely modular.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.149
You have the surface barrier
of the human skin,

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.394
you have the very rapidly reacting
innate immune system

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:46.440
and then you have the highly targeted
adaptive immune system.

00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:50.862
The point is, that if one system fails,
another can take over,

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.937
creating a virtually foolproof system.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.461
I can see I'm losing you, Bob,
but stay with me,

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.789
because here is the really killer feature.

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:04.340
The product is completely adaptive.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.331
It's able to actually develop
targeted antibodies

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.871
to threats that it's never
even met before.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.480
It actually also does this
with incredible prudence,

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:21.179
detecting and reacting
to every tiny threat,

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:25.538
and furthermore, remembering
every previous threat,

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.132
in case they are ever encountered again.

00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:32.405
What I'm pitching you today
is actually not a stand-alone product.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.984
The product is embedded
in the larger system of the human body,

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.921
and it works in complete harmony
with that system,

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:43.999
to create this unprecedented level
of biological protection.

00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:47.248
So Bob, just tell me honestly,
what do you think of my product?

00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:50.866
And Bob may say something like,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.805
I sincerely appreciate
the effort and passion

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.672
that have gone into your presentation,

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:57.850
blah blah blah --

00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:59.054
(Laughter)

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:02.131
But honestly, it's total nonsense.

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:07.450
You seem to be saying that the key
selling points of your product

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:10.175
are that it is inefficient and complex.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.770
Didn't they teach you 80-20?

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.121
And furthermore, you're saying
that this product is siloed.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.081
It overreacts,

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:20.644
makes things up as it goes along

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.159
and is actually designed
for somebody else's benefit.

00:03:23.183 --> 00:03:26.790
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but I don't think this one is a winner.

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:29.213
If we went with Bob's philosophy,

00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:32.705
I think we'd actually end up
with a more efficient immune system.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.735
And efficiency is always important
in the short term.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:40.298
Less complex, more efficient,
more bang for the buck.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:41.680
Who could say no to that?

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:44.538
Unfortunately, there's one
very tiny problem,

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:47.827
and that is that the user
of this product, you or I,

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:51.524
would probably die
within one week of the next winter,

00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:55.412
when we encountered a new strain
of the influenza virus.

00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.361
I first became interested
in biology and business,

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:03.764
and longevity and resilience,

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:06.039
when I was asked a very unusual question

00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:08.735
by the CEO of a global tech company.

00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:10.707
And the question was:

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:16.893
What do we have to do to make sure
that our company lasts 100 years?

00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.381
A seemingly innocent question,

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:23.216
but actually, it's a little trickier
than you might think,

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.567
considering that the average
US public company now

00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:32.089
can expect a life span of only 30 years.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:35.754
That is less than half of the life span

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:38.604
that its employees can expect to enjoy.

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:41.999
Now, if you were the CEO
of such a company,

00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:45.710
badgered by investors
and buffeted by change,

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.894
we might forgive you
for not even worrying too much

00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:50.619
about what happens 30 years out.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.348
But here's something that should
keep you awake at night:

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.425
the probability that your company
will not be around in five year's time,

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.088
on average, is now
a staggering 32 percent.

00:05:04.164 --> 00:05:08.208
That's a one in three chance
that your company will be taken over

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:11.025
or will fail within just five years.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:16.010
Let's come back
to our tech CEO's question.

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:19.813
Where better to turn
for advice than nature,

00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:22.431
that's been in the business
of life and death

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.421
for longer than any company?

00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:28.930
As a lapsed biologist,

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:32.315
I decided to immediately call
a real biologist,

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.353
my friend Simon Levin,

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:37.581
Professor of Biology and Mathematics
at Princeton University.

00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:42.091
Together, we looked at a variety
of biological systems,

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.381
ranging from natural tropical rainforests

00:05:45.405 --> 00:05:48.327
through to managed forests and fisheries.

00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:50.075
And we asked ourselves the question:

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.957
What makes these systems
resilient and enduring?

00:05:56.176 --> 00:06:00.321
And what we found
was that the same six principles

00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:03.370
that we saw underpinning
the miracle of the human immune system

00:06:03.394 --> 00:06:06.455
actually cropped up again and again,

00:06:07.157 --> 00:06:10.191
from redundancy through to embeddedness.

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.275
In fact, we saw these principles
not only in biologically enduring systems,

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:18.170
we also found them
being very characteristic

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:20.581
of long-lived social systems,

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:22.823
like the Roman Empire
and the Catholic Church,

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:24.145
believe it or not.

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.007
We also went on to look at business,

00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:30.887
and found that these very same properties
also characterized businesses

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:32.871
that were resilient and long-lived,

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:37.014
and we noted their absence
from ones which were short-lived.

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:43.184
Let's first take a look at what happens
when the corporate immune system

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.373
collapses.

00:06:45.202 --> 00:06:49.744
This beautiful building is part
of the Shitennoji Temple Complex

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:51.091
in Osaka, Japan.

00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:54.512
In fact, it's one of the oldest
temples in Japan.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.393
It was built by a Korean artisan,

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.486
because at the time,
Japan was not yet building temples.

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:05.673
And this Korean artisan went on
to found a temple-building company.

00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:10.422
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:15.670
was still around 1,428 years later.

00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:19.294
In fact, it became the oldest
continuously operating company

00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:20.562
in the world.

00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:23.999
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.737
Not too well, I'm afraid.

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:29.912
It borrowed very heavily

00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:32.714
during the bubble period
of the Japanese economy,

00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:34.201
to invest in real estate.

00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:37.656
And when the bubble burst,
it couldn't refinance its loans.

00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:39.751
The company failed,

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:42.992
and it was taken over
by a major construction company.

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:49.442
Tragically, after 40 generations
of very careful stewardship

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:50.685
by the Kongō family,

00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:55.514
Kongō Gumi succumbed
to a spectacular lapse

00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:59.489
in the ability to apply
a principle of prudence.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.044
Speaking of company failures:

00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:06.267
we're all familiar
with the failure of Kodak,

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:09.470
the company that declared bankruptcy

00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:11.119
in January 2012.

00:08:13.322 --> 00:08:17.261
Much more interesting,
however, is the question:

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:18.906
Why did Fujifilm --

00:08:19.662 --> 00:08:24.905
same product, same pressures
from digital technology, same time --

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:28.635
why was Fujifilm
able to survive and flourish?

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:36.817
Fujifilm used its capabilities
in chemistry, material science and optics

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:40.313
to diversify into a number of areas,

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:44.001
ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:46.011
to medical systems to biomaterials.

00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:48.720
Some of these diversification
attempts failed.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.064
But in aggregate,

00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:55.428
it was able to adapt
its portfolio sufficiently

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.227
to survive and flourish.

00:08:58.633 --> 00:09:01.476
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.736
the strategy succeeded
because it had "more pockets and drawers"

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.151
than the rivals.

00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:08.326
He meant, of course,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.777
that they were able to create
more options than the rivals.

00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:17.550
Fujifilm survived because it applied
the principles of prudence,

00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:18.965
diversity

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:20.158
and adaptation.

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:24.576
A catastrophic factory fire,
like the one we see here,

00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:28.326
completely wiped out, in one evening,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.255
the only plant which supplied Toyota
with valves for car-braking systems.

00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:38.693
The ultimate test of resilience.

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:42.988
Car production ground
to a screeching halt.

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:49.066
How was it, then, that Toyota
was able to recover car production?

00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.184
Can you imagine how long it took?

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:53.511
Just five days.

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:58.034
From having no braking valves
to complete recovery in five days.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.191
How was this possible?

00:10:00.747 --> 00:10:06.033
Toyota managed its network of suppliers
in such a collaborative manner

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:10.293
that it could work very quickly
and smoothly with suppliers

00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:12.028
to repurpose production,

00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:15.629
fill the missing braking valve capacity

00:10:15.653 --> 00:10:18.962
and have car production come online again.

00:10:20.093 --> 00:10:24.395
Toyota applied the principles
of modularity of its supply network,

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.563
embeddedness in an integrated system

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:31.190
and the functional redundancy
to be able to repurpose, smoothly,

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.634
existing capacity.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.165
Now fortunately, few companies
succumb to catastrophic fires.

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:42.282
But we do read in the newspaper
every day about companies

00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:45.705
succumbing to the disruption
of technology.

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:50.534
How is it, then, that the consumer
optics giant Essilor

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:54.604
is able to avoid technology disruption,
and even profit from it?

00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:58.539
And yes, technology disruption
is not only a big deal

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.648
in software and electronics.

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:05.655
Essilor carefully scans
the competitive environment

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:08.514
for potentially disruptive technologies.

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:12.293
It acquires those technologies very early,

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:16.093
before they've become expensive
or competitors have mobilized around them,

00:11:16.117 --> 00:11:18.662
and it then develops
those technologies itself,

00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:21.239
even at the risk of failure

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.388
or the risk of self-disruption.

00:11:24.409 --> 00:11:27.027
Essilor stays ahead of its game,

00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:29.057
and has delivered spectacular performance

00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:30.524
for over 40 years,

00:11:30.548 --> 00:11:34.745
by using the principles
of prudence and adaptation.

00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:39.298
OK, if these principles are so powerful,
you might be thinking,

00:11:39.986 --> 00:11:42.893
why are they not commonplace in business?

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.143
Why do we not use these words every day?

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.952
Well, change has to first
start in the mind.

00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:50.021
If we think back to our pitch to Bob,

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.433
in order to apply the principles

00:11:52.457 --> 00:11:55.214
that underpin the miracle
of the human immune system,

00:11:55.827 --> 00:11:58.231
we first need to think differently

00:11:58.255 --> 00:11:59.425
about business.

00:11:59.838 --> 00:12:02.545
Now typically, when we think
about business,

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:05.051
we use what I call "mechanical thinking."

00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:07.599
We set goals,

00:12:07.623 --> 00:12:09.162
we analyze problems,

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:11.513
we construct and we adhere to plans,

00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:12.880
and more than anything else,

00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:15.915
we stress efficiency
and short-term performance.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:17.594
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:12:17.618 --> 00:12:20.732
this is a splendidly practical
and effective way

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:23.196
of addressing relatively simple challenges

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.210
in relatively stable environments.

00:12:26.005 --> 00:12:29.467
It's the way that Bob -- and probably
many of us, myself included --

00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:32.460
process most business problems
we're faced with every day.

00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:37.012
In fact, it was a pretty good
mental model for business --

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.557
overall --

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:40.609
until about the mid-1980s,

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:43.997
when the conjunction of globalization

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:46.544
and a revolution in technology
and telecommunications

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.006
made business far more
dynamic and unpredictable.

00:12:49.497 --> 00:12:52.575
But what about those more dynamic
and unpredictable situations

00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:54.690
that we now increasingly face?

00:12:55.597 --> 00:12:58.012
I think in addition
to the mechanical thinking,

00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:01.729
we now need to master the art
of biological thinking,

00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:04.378
as embodied by our six principles.

00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:08.898
In other words, we need to think
more modestly and subtly

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:11.218
about when and how

00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:14.014
we can shape, rather than control,

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:18.138
unpredictable and complex situations.

00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:22.661
It's a little like the difference
between throwing a ball

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:24.708
and releasing a bird.

00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:27.628
The ball would head in a straight line,

00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:29.870
probably towards the intended target,

00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:33.001
and the bird certainly would not.

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:37.049
So what do you think?

00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:40.360
Sounds a little impractical,
a little theoretical, perhaps?

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:42.978
Not at all.

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.038
Every small entrepreneurial company

00:13:47.038 --> 00:13:49.882
naturally thinks and acts biologically.

00:13:50.404 --> 00:13:51.555
Why?

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:54.209
Because it lacks the resources
to shape its environment

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.527
through brute force.

00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:58.190
It lacks the scale to buffer change,

00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:02.427
and it's constantly thinking
about the tough odds

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:04.577
for a start-up to survive.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.035
Now, the irony is, of course,

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:11.636
that every large company started off
as a small, entrepreneurial company.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.231
But along the way somewhere,

00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:17.346
many have lost this ability
to think and act biologically.

00:14:18.604 --> 00:14:22.400
They need to rejuvenate
their ability to think biologically

00:14:23.603 --> 00:14:27.220
in order to survive and thrive
in today's environment.

00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:31.313
So let's not just think
about short-term performance.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.955
Every company I know spends plenty of time

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:37.376
thinking about the central
question of strategy:

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.299
How good is our competitive game?

00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:42.144
In addition, let's also consider

00:14:42.168 --> 00:14:46.229
the second, more biological
and equally important question:

00:14:46.253 --> 00:14:48.659
How long will that game last?

00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:50.262
Thank you very much.

00:14:50.286 --> 00:14:53.456
(Applause)
