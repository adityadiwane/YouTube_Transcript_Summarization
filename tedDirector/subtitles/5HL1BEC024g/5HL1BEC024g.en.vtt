00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.959
Well, I have a big announcement to make today,

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.132
and I'm really excited about this.

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:19.460
And this may be a little bit of a surprise

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.714
to many of you who know my research

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:24.869
and what I've done well.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.273
I've really tried to solve some big problems:

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.740
counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.388
and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:36.852
but I started thinking about all these problems,

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:41.412
and I realized that the really biggest problem we face,

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:43.660
what all these other problems come down to,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.302
is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:50.421
And I decided that I was going to set out

00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.803
to try to solve this problem.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:57.775
And this probably is not what you're expecting.

00:00:57.775 --> 00:00:59.427
You're probably expecting me to come up here

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.006
and talk about fusion,

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:02.986
because that's what I've done most of my life.

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:06.252
But this is actually a talk about, okay --

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:08.876
(Laughter) â€”

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.843
but this is actually a talk about fission.

00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:13.369
It's about perfecting something old,

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.019
and bringing something old into the 21st century.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:20.644
Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:22.388
In a nuclear power plant, you have

00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:25.036
a big pot of water that's under high pressure,

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:26.554
and you have some fuel rods,

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.923
and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.793
and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:35.949
and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:39.100
and that reaction heats up water,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.925
the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.855
and you produce electricity from it.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:46.635
This is the same way we've been producing electricity,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:50.100
the steam turbine idea, for 100 years,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.121
and nuclear was a really big advancement

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.701
in a way to heat the water,

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:59.156
but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:02.972
And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:05.772
Is fission kind of played out,

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:08.627
or is there something left to innovate here?

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:11.212
And I realized that I had hit upon something

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:15.516
that I think has this huge potential to change the world.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:19.007
And this is what it is.

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.612
This is a small modular reactor.

00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:26.316
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.719
This is between 50 and 100 megawatts.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.340
But that's a ton of power.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.789
That's between, say at an average use,

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.930
that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.508
Now the really interesting thing about these reactors

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:43.633
is they're built in a factory.

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.596
So they're modular reactors that are built

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.941
essentially on an assembly line,

00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.100
and they're trucked anywhere in the world,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.411
you plop them down, and they produce electricity.

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.853
This region right here is the reactor.

00:02:55.853 --> 00:02:58.164
And this is buried below ground, which is really important.

00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:00.877
For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:03.573
I can't extol to you

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:06.358
how great having something buried below the ground is

00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:10.397
for proliferation and security concerns.

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:13.910
And inside this reactor is a molten salt,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.688
so anybody who's a fan of thorium,

00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:18.014
they're going to be really excited about this,

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:23.096
because these reactors happen to be really good

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:25.680
at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.731
uranium-233.

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.301
But I'm not really concerned about the fuel.

00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:33.525
You can run these off -- they're really hungry,

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.957
they really like down-blended weapons pits,

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:39.821
so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.854
that's been down-blended.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.246
It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:47.397
but they love this stuff.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:49.180
And we have a lot of it sitting around,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.822
because this is a big problem.

00:03:50.822 --> 00:03:52.939
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.279
of nuclear weapons, and that was great,

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.734
and we don't need them anymore,

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:01.078
and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:03.493
What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.394
Well, we're securing them, and it would be great

00:04:05.394 --> 00:04:07.138
if we could burn them, eat them up,

00:04:07.138 --> 00:04:09.139
and this reactor loves this stuff.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.161
So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,

00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.935
and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,

00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:20.005
the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.

00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:22.652
It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:24.432
And then that's a heat exchanger

00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:27.725
to what makes this design really, really interesting,

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.733
and that's a heat exchanger to a gas.

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:33.277
So going back to what I was saying before about all power

00:04:33.277 --> 00:04:36.270
being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic --

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.168
being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:42.688
that's actually not that efficient, and in fact,

00:04:42.688 --> 00:04:45.064
in a nuclear power plant like this,

00:04:45.064 --> 00:04:49.872
it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.409
That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.062
to how much electricity it's producing.

00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:56.987
And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors

00:04:56.987 --> 00:04:58.693
operate at pretty low temperature.

00:04:58.693 --> 00:05:00.448
They operate anywhere from, you know,

00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:04.141
maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:08.140
And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.845
which means the higher the temperature you go to,

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.741
thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.

00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:17.415
And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.893
so supercritical CO2 or helium,

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:21.334
and that goes into a turbine,

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.195
and this is called the Brayton cycle.

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.669
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.099
and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.989
between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:32.660
And I'm really excited about this,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.173
because it's a very compact core.

00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:39.309
Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature,

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.614
but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out

00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:45.359
for how much uranium you're fissioning,

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:47.438
not to mention the fact that these burn up.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:49.030
Their burn-up is much higher.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.008
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:53.364
a lot more of it's being used.

00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:56.549
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this

00:05:56.549 --> 00:06:00.821
is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,

00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:03.550
and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.724
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,

00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:08.940
and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.241
So you have what's called the xenon pit,

00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.345
and so some of these fission products love neutrons.

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:14.592
They love the neutrons that are going on

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:16.992
and helping this reaction take place.

00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:19.968
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with

00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:22.205
the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,

00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:23.919
you can only run one of these reactors

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.447
for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.

00:06:28.447 --> 00:06:33.038
So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,

00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:35.758
which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,

00:06:35.758 --> 00:06:37.711
because it means it's a sealed system.

00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:40.582
No refueling means you can seal them up

00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:43.495
and they're not going to be a proliferation risk,

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.766
and they're not going to have

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:48.270
either nuclear material or radiological material

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.582
proliferated from their cores.

00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:53.646
But let's go back to safety, because everybody

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:57.424
after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,

00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:59.974
and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:03.526
was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:06.005
and I'm really excited about this reactor

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:08.334
for essentially two reasons.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:11.278
One, it doesn't operate at high pressure.

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:14.519
So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.951
or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water

00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:20.358
at very high pressures, and this means, essentially,

00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:23.222
in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach

00:07:23.222 --> 00:07:26.263
of this stainless steel pressure vessel,

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:28.535
the coolant would leave the core.

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:31.574
These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:35.480
so there's no inclination for the fission products

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.052
to leave the reactor in the event of an accident.

00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:40.370
Also, they operate at high temperatures,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.249
and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:47.827
but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,

00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:50.137
or you lost off-site power in the case

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.327
of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:57.798
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,

00:07:57.798 --> 00:08:00.169
you could actually just drain the core

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.350
into what's called a sub-critical setting,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.304
basically a tank underneath the reactor

00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:06.264
that has some neutrons absorbers.

00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:10.054
And this is really important, because the reaction stops.

00:08:10.054 --> 00:08:12.718
In this kind of reactor, you can't do that.

00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:16.199
The fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:19.190
and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.327
Fukushima and Three Mile Island --

00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:24.222
looking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while â€”

00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:27.708
but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:30.537
what happens is, when they see high pressure water,

00:08:30.537 --> 00:08:33.094
steam, in an oxidizing environment,

00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:35.166
they'll actually produce hydrogen,

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:38.094
and that hydrogen has this explosive capability

00:08:38.094 --> 00:08:40.304
to release fission products.

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:42.518
So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure

00:08:42.518 --> 00:08:44.782
and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:48.256
means that there's no inclination for the fission products

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:49.990
to leave this reactor.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.255
So even in the event of an accident,

00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:55.973
yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,

00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:57.632
sorry for the power company,

00:08:57.632 --> 00:08:59.732
but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.

00:08:59.732 --> 00:09:03.744
So I really think that in the, say,

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.872
20 years it's going to take us to get fusion

00:09:05.872 --> 00:09:08.092
and make fusion a reality,

00:09:08.092 --> 00:09:10.673
this could be the source of energy

00:09:10.673 --> 00:09:13.347
that provides carbon-free electricity.

00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:15.005
Carbon-free electricity.

00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:18.350
And it's an amazing technology because

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.180
not only does it combat climate change,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.684
but it's an innovation.

00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:25.751
It's a way to bring power to the developing world,

00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:28.230
because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.366
You can put them anywhere in the world you want to.

00:09:30.366 --> 00:09:33.622
And maybe something else.

00:09:33.622 --> 00:09:36.143
As a kid, I was obsessed with space.

00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:38.886
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,

00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:41.286
but before that I was obsessed with space,

00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:43.197
and I was really excited about, you know,

00:09:43.197 --> 00:09:45.071
being an astronaut and designing rockets,

00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:47.157
which was something that was always exciting to me.

00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:50.563
But I think I get to come back to this,

00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:53.864
because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket

00:09:53.864 --> 00:09:56.694
that produces 50 to 100 megawatts.

00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:59.971
That is the rocket designer's dream.

00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:03.702
That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.706
Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:10.119
to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:11.518
but you have power once you get there.

00:10:11.518 --> 00:10:15.039
You know, rocket designers who use solar panels

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:17.998
or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts --

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:19.591
wow, that's a lot of power.

00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:22.036
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.209
That's a ton of power.

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:25.496
That could power a Martian community.

00:10:25.496 --> 00:10:27.093
That could power a rocket there.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.800
And so I hope that

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.921
maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore

00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:36.588
my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:39.578
And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:42.142
and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.175
But we launch plutonium batteries all the time.

00:10:45.175 --> 00:10:47.294
Everybody was really excited about Curiosity,

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:49.895
and that had this big plutonium battery on board

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:52.014
that has plutonium-238,

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:54.414
which actually has a higher specific activity

00:10:54.414 --> 00:10:58.158
than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.661
which means that the effects would be negligible,

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.113
because you launch it cold,

00:11:03.113 --> 00:11:06.824
and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.

00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:08.132
So I'm really excited.

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:10.669
I think that I've designed this reactor here

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:14.574
that can be an innovative source of energy,

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:18.255
provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,

00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:20.783
and I'm really prepared to do this.

00:11:20.783 --> 00:11:23.550
I graduated high school in May, and --

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.698
(Laughter) (Applause) â€”

00:11:27.698 --> 00:11:29.749
I graduated high school in May,

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:32.589
and I decided that I was going to start up a company

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:34.957
to commercialize these technologies that I've developed,

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:37.814
these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers

00:11:37.814 --> 00:11:40.094
and these systems to produce medical isotopes,

00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:43.542
but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:45.795
a team of some of the most incredible people

00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:47.982
I've ever had the chance to work with,

00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:50.744
and I'm really prepared to make this a reality.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:53.841
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology,

00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:59.191
this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,

00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:00.991
and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,

00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:03.718
which is an advantage for the developing world.

00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:06.840
And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.769
to end with, which is weird for a scientist.

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.263
But I think there's something really poetic

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:15.062
about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,

00:12:15.062 --> 00:12:17.817
because the stars are giant fusion reactors.

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:20.158
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.

00:12:20.158 --> 00:12:23.555
The energy that I'm able to talk to you today,

00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:25.650
while it was converted to chemical energy in my food,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.838
originally came from a nuclear reaction,

00:12:28.838 --> 00:12:31.614
and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,

00:12:31.614 --> 00:12:34.583
perfecting nuclear fission

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:38.302
and using it as a future source of innovative energy.

00:12:38.302 --> 00:12:40.253
So thank you guys.

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:45.238
(Applause)
