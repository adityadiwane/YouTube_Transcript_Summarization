00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Martin Luther King

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
did not say,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
"I have a nightmare,"

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
when he inspired the civil rights movements.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
He said, "I have a dream."

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And I have a dream.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I have a dream that we can stop thinking

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that the future will be a nightmare,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and this is going to be a challenge,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
because, if you think

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
of every major blockbusting film of recent times,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
nearly all of its visions for humanity

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
are apocalyptic.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I think this film

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
but everything is desolate,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
everything is dead.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And just a father and son

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
trying to survive, walking along the road.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And I think the environmental movement

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
of which I am a part of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
has been complicit

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
in creating this vision of the future.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
For too long,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
we have peddled a nightmarish vision

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
of what's going to happen.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
We have focused on the problems.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And we have not thought enough

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
about the solutions.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
We've used fear, if you like,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
to grab people's attention.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And any psychologist will tell you

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that fear in the organism

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
is linked to flight mechanism.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that when an animal is frightened --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
think of a deer.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
A deer freezes very, very still,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
poised to run away.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And I think that's what we're doing

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
when we're asking people to engage with our agenda

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
around environmental degradation and climate change.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
People are freezing and running away

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
because we're using fear.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and start to think about

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
what progress is.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And one of the problems that we face, I think,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
is that the only people that have cornered the market

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
in terms of progress

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
is a financial definition of what progress is,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
an economic definition of what progress is --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that somehow,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
if we get the right numbers to go up,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we're going to be better off,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
whether that's on the stock market,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
whether that's with GDP

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and economic growth,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
that somehow life is going to get better.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
This is somehow appealing to human greed

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
instead of fear --

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
that more is better.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of the welfare of nations.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
said that, "A nation's welfare

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
can scarcely be inferred from their national income."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
But we've created a national accounting system

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
which is firmly based on production

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and producing stuff.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And so our national accounting system

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
became fixated on what we can produce.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
But as early as 1968,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
this visionary man, Robert Kennedy,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
gave the most eloquent deconstruction

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
of gross national product

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
that ever has been.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And he finished his talk with the phrase,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
that, "The gross national product

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
measures everything except that

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
which makes life worthwhile."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
our dominant measure of progress in society,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
is measuring everything

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
except that which makes life worthwhile?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
he would be asking statisticians such as myself

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
to go out and find out

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
what makes life worthwhile.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
He'd be asking us to redesign

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
our national accounting system

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to be based upon

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
such important things as social justice,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
sustainability

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and people's well-being.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And actually, social scientists have already gone out

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and asked these questions around the world.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
This is from a global survey.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
It's asking people, what do they want.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
say that what they want

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
is happiness, for themselves,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
for their families, their children,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
their communities.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Okay, they think money is slightly important.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and it's not nearly as important as love.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
We all need to love and be loved in life.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It's not nearly as important as health.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
We want to be healthy and live a full life.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
These seem to be natural human aspirations.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Why are statisticians not measuring these?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
instead of just how much stuff we have?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
is think about how do we measure happiness,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
how do we measure well-being,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
how can we do that within environmental limits.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And we created, at the organization that I work for,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
the New Economics Foundation,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
something we call the Happy Planet Index,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And what we do,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
is how successful is it

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
That should be the goal

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
of every nation on the planet.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
But we have to remember

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that there's a fundamental input to that,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
It is the ultimate scarce resource,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
the one planet that we share.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And economics is very interested in scarcity.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
When it has a scarce resource

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that it wants to turn into

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
a desirable outcome,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
it thinks in terms of efficiency.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And this is a measure of how much well-being

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
we get for our planetary resource use.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It is an efficiency measure.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And probably the easiest way to show you that,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
is to show you this graph.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Running horizontally along the graph,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
is "ecological footprint,"

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
which is a measure of how much resources we use

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and how much pressure we put on the planet.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
More is bad.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Running vertically upwards,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
is a measure called "happy life years."

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
It's about the well-being of nations.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Now, there's a huge array of nations

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
around that global average.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
To the top right of the graph,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
but they're using a lot of planet to get there.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
They are the U.S.A.,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
other Western countries going across in those triangles

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and a few Gulf states in there actually.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
are countries that are not producing much well-being --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
typically, sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
In Hobbesian terms,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
life is short and brutish there.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
The average life expectancy in many of these countries

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
is only 40 years.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Malaria, HIV/AIDS

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
are killing a lot of people

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
in these regions of the world.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
But now for the good news!

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that are doing better than global average,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
This is an aspirational graph.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
They're Latin American.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
The country on its own up at the top

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
is a place I haven't been to.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Maybe some of you have.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Costa Rica.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Costa Rica --

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
That is longer than in the USA.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
the happiest nation on the planet --

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
They are the happiest place.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
They are doing that

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
on a quarter of the resources

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that are used typically in [the] Western world --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
a quarter of the resources.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
What's going on there?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
What's happening in Costa Rica?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
We can look at some of the data.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Their government is one of the first to commit

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
to be carbon neutral by 2021.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
They abolished the army

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
in 1949 --

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
1949.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And they invested in social programs --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
health and education.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and in the world.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
They have the social connectedness.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
(Laughter)

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
is that the future

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
might not be North American,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
might not be Western European.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
It might be Latin American.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And the challenge, really,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
is to pull the global average up here.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
That's what we need to do.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And if we're going to do that,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
we need to pull countries from the bottom,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
That's one way of looking at it.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And this is the trend in well-being over that time,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
a small increase,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
but this is the trend in ecological footprint.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And so in strict happy-planet methodology,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
we've become less efficient

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
at turning our ultimate scarce resource

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
into the outcome we want to.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And the point really is, is that I think,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
probably everybody in this room

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
would like society to get to 2050

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
without an apocalyptic

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
something happening.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
It's actually not very long away.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It's half a human lifetime away.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
A child entering school today

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
will be my age in 2050.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
This is not the very distant future.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
This is what the U.K. government target

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
That is changing our business.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
That is changing the way we create our organizations,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
we do our government policy and we live our lives.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And the point is,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
we need to carry on increasing well-being.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
No one can go to the polls

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and say that quality of life is going to reduce.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
None of us, I think,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
want human progress to stop.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
I think we want it to carry on.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
They want to hold on to what they've got.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And if we're going to engage them,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
I think that's what we've got to do.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
but the point is we need to turn those curves.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And this is where I think we can take a leaf

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
out of systems theory, systems engineers,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
where they create feedback loops,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
put the right information at the right point of time.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
You put a smart meter in your home,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and you see how much electricity you're using right now,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
how much it's costing you,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
What would that look like for society?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Why is it, on the radio news every evening,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And why do I hear that?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
or American used yesterday?

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Did we meet our three percent annual target

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
on reducing carbon emissions?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
That's how you create a collective goal.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And we need positive feedback loops

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
for increasing well-being

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
which we know is really linked to creativity,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
which is linked to innovation,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
on five fruit and vegetables a day

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
What are these for happiness?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
What are the five things that you should do every day

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
to be happier?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
a big program called the Foresight program --

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
everything evidence based -- a huge tome.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to improve well-being in your life?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And the point of these is

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And the first of these is to connect,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
is that your social relationships

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
are the most important cornerstones of your life.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
Do you invest the time with your loved ones

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that you could do, and energy?

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Keep building them.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
The second one is be active.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
The fastest way out of a bad mood:

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Being active is great for our positive mood.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
The third one is take notice.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
How aware are you of things going on around the world,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
the seasons changing, people around you?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
[very] strong for our well being.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
The fourth is keep learning

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and keep is important --

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
learning throughout the whole life course.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Older people who keep learning and are curious,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
It's more curiosity.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
It can be learning to cook a new dish,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Keep learning.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And the final one

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
is that most anti-economic of activities,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
but give.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Our generosity, our altruism,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
our compassion,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
are all hardwired

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
to the reward mechanism in our brain.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
We feel good if we give.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
You can do an experiment where you give

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and one on other people.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
You measure their happiness at the end of the day,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that those that spent it on themselves.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And these five ways,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
which we put onto these handy postcards,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
I would say, don't have to cost the earth.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
They don't have any carbon content.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And so I think it's really quite feasible

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
that happiness does not cost the earth.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Now, Martin Luther King,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
on the eve of his death,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
gave an incredible speech.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
there may be trouble ahead,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
but I fear no one. I don't care.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
I have been to the mountain top,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and I have seen the Promised Land."

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Now, he was a preacher,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
but I believe the environmental movement

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and, in fact, the business community, government,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
needs to go to the top of the mountain top,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
and it needs to look out,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and it needs to see the Promised Land,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
or the land of promise,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
and it needs to have a vision

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
of a world that we all want.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
to get there,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and we need to pave that great transition with good things.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Human beings want to be happy.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
Pave them with the five ways.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
And we need to have signposts

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
gathering people together and pointing them --

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
something like the Happy Planet Index.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
And then I believe

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that we can all create a world we all want,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
where happiness does not cost the earth.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.260
(Applause)
