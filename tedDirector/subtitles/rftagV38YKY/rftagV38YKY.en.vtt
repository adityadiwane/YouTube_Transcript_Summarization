00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.362
As an archaeologist,

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:17.484
I'm most often asked
what my favorite discovery is.

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.606
The answer's easy:

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.183
my husband, Greg.

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:23.578
(Laughter)

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.364
We met in Egypt on my first dig.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:30.492
It was my first lesson in finding
unexpected, wonderful things.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.910
This began an incredible
archaeological partnership.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:41.405
Years later, I proposed to him
in front of our favorite pair statue

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.590
of the Prince and Princess
Rahotep and Nofret,

00:00:44.614 --> 00:00:45.855
in the Cairo Museum,

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.974
dating to 4,600 years ago.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:53.459
I thought if I was going to ask Greg
to spend the rest of this life with me,

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:56.260
then I should ask him
in front of two people

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.365
who had pledged
to be together for eternity.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.878
These symbols endure
because when we look at them,

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:05.343
we're looking at mirrors.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.798
They are powerful reminders

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:10.631
that our common humanity has not changed.

00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:17.007
The thrill of archaeological discovery
is as powerful as love,

00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:22.078
because ancient history is the most
seductive mistress imaginable.

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:25.239
Many archaeologists
have devoted their lives

00:01:25.263 --> 00:01:27.692
to unraveling the mysteries of the past

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.372
under hot suns

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:31.859
and Arctic winds

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.248
and in dense rainforests.

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:36.816
Many seek.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.991
Some discover.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.833
All worship at the temple of possibility

00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:43.677
that one discovery might change history.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.945
On my first day in Egypt,
I worked at a site

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.609
in the Northeast Egyptian Delta
called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:54.784
in a cemetery.

00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:56.008
That's a picture of me --

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.233
I'm just in my bliss.

00:01:57.708 --> 00:02:01.721
On the dig, surrounded
by emerald green rice paddies,

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.233
I discovered an intact pot.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.218
Flipping it over,

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:11.725
I discovered a human thumbprint
left by whoever made the vessel.

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:14.778
For a moment, time stood still.

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:17.234
I didn't know where I was.

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:20.732
It was because at that moment I realized,

00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:22.134
when we dig,

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:23.815
we're digging for people,

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.050
not things.

00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:31.435
Never are we so present as when
we are in the midst of the great past.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:37.151
I can't tell you how many times I've stood
in front of the Pyramids of Giza,

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.440
and they leave me speechless.

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:42.441
I feel like the luckiest
person in the world.

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:48.761
They're a monument to our human brilliance
and everything that is possible.

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:52.646
Many cannot process
their brilliance as human --

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.271
they think aliens built them.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.260
But this is ridiculous.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:00.396
All you need to do
is get up close and personal,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.892
and see the hidden hand of man

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:06.493
in the chisel marks left
by the tools that built them.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:11.776
The Great Pyramid of Giza
was built one stone at a time

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.968
with 2.3 million blocks,

00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:17.690
with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:22.089
It is not the pyramids
that stand the test of time;

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:23.875
it is human ingenuity.

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:28.282
That is our shared human brilliance.

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:31.869
History may be cyclical,

00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:34.732
but we are singular.

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:37.164
I love what I do,

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:39.853
because I learn that we haven't changed.

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:45.490
I get to read about mother-in-law
jokes from Mesopotamia

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.066
from 3,500 years ago.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.621
(Laughter)

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.199
I get to hear about neighbors
cursing each other

00:03:53.223 --> 00:03:55.721
from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.

00:03:55.745 --> 00:04:00.348
And my absolute favorite,
from 3,300 years ago in Luxor:

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:05.880
an inscription that describes schoolboys
who cut class to go drinking.

00:04:05.904 --> 00:04:07.874
(Laughter)

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:09.866
Kids these days.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.214
(Laughter)

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:15.062
I get to see the most
incredible architecture,

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:17.994
see stunning sculptures --

00:04:18.018 --> 00:04:20.861
I mean, this is basically
a selfie in stone --

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.842
and see that we've always
rocked serious bling.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:28.007
And also, we've been posting on walls

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:30.110
and obsessing about cats --

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:31.141
(Laughter)

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:32.678
for thousands of years.

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:33.709
(Laughter)

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:36.069
(Applause)

00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:41.956
Archaeologists are the cultural
memory preservers

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.621
and the spokespeople

00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:46.977
for the billions of people
and the thousands of cultures

00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:48.335
that came before us.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.051
Good science, imagination
and a leap of faith

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.515
are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:57.984
In the last year,

00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:01.184
archaeologists have made
incredible discoveries, including:

00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:04.336
new human ancestors from South Africa;

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.398
tools from 3.3 million years ago --

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:10.658
these are the oldest tools
ever discovered --

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:12.030
in Kenya.

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:15.698
And this, from a series
of medical implements found

00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:18.540
from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:24.058
What you're looking at is a medical tool
used to treat syphilis.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:26.459
Ouch!

00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:27.843
(Laughter)

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:29.211
For each of these,

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:32.678
there are thousands of other
incredibly important discoveries

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:34.174
made by my colleagues,

00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:35.648
that do not make headlines.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:42.718
However, I believe that the most
important thing we do as archaeologists

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:46.433
is acknowledge that past people existed

00:05:46.457 --> 00:05:48.331
and lived lives worth learning about.

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:53.155
Can you even imagine
what the world would be like today

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:56.421
if we acknowledged all
human beings in this way?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.656
So, on a dig, we have a challenge:

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.372
it often looks like this.

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:06.230
You can't see anything.

00:06:06.254 --> 00:06:08.003
Where are we going to start digging?

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.738
This is from a site south of Cairo.

00:06:09.762 --> 00:06:11.495
Let's have a look from space.

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.347
Again, you can't really see much.

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:18.158
What you're looking at
is a WorldView-3 satellite image,

00:06:18.182 --> 00:06:21.241
which has a .3 meter resolution.

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:22.643
That's 10 inches.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:26.941
This means that you can zoom in
from 400 miles in space

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.402
and see your tablets.

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.827
How do I know about this?

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:34.808
It's because I'm a space archaeologist.

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.391
Let me repeat that.

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:40.632
I am a space archaeologist.

00:06:40.656 --> 00:06:41.808
This means --

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.078
(Applause)

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.388
Thank you.

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:49.247
This means I use satellite images
and process them using algorithms,

00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.907
and look at subtle differences
in the light spectrum

00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:54.245
that indicate buried things
under the ground

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:56.738
that I get to go excavate and survey.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.477
By the way --

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.078
NASA has a Space Archaeology program,

00:07:01.102 --> 00:07:02.588
so it's a real job.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:03.762
(Laughter)

00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:05.835
So, let's have a look again.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.944
We're back at the site
just south of Cairo.

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:09.651
You can't see anything.

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:13.053
Keep your eye on the red rectangle.

00:07:13.077 --> 00:07:15.704
When we process the image
using algorithms --

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:18.133
think like a space-based CAT scan --

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.305
this is what you see.

00:07:21.894 --> 00:07:25.603
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb

00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:28.228
that is previously unknown
and unexcavated,

00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:33.013
and you all are the first people
to see it in thousands of years.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:39.119
(Applause)

00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:41.970
I believe we have barely
scratched the surface

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.074
in terms of what's left to discover.

00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:46.916
In the Egyptian Delta alone,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.758
we've excavated less
than one-1000th of one percent

00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:53.495
of the total volume of Egyptian sites.

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:56.474
When you add to that
the thousands of other sites

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:58.530
my team and I have discovered,

00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:02.309
what we thought we knew
pales in comparison

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.231
to what we have left to discover.

00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:06.741
When you look at the incredible work

00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:09.186
that my colleagues are doing
all around the world

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.017
and what they're finding,

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:16.639
I believe that there are millions
of undiscovered archaeological sites

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:17.823
left to find.

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:21.009
Discovering them will do nothing less

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:24.747
than unlock the full potential
of our existence.

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:28.549
But we have a challenge.

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:30.730
Over the last year,

00:08:30.754 --> 00:08:33.378
we've seen horrible headlines

00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:37.724
of incredible destruction going on
to archaeological sites,

00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:40.553
and massive looting by people like ISIL.

00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:45.036
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.675
Who blows up a temple?

00:08:47.257 --> 00:08:49.336
They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.831
And we've seen looting
at sites so rampant,

00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:57.675
it looks like craters of the moon.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.280
Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy
modern human lives,

00:09:03.304 --> 00:09:07.692
it's a natural extension for them
to destroy cultural identity as well.

00:09:07.716 --> 00:09:10.870
Countless invading armies
have done the same throughout history.

00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:15.497
We know that ISIL is profiting
from the looting of sites,

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.062
but we don't know the scale.

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:21.755
This means that any object
purchased on the market today

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:22.935
from the Middle East

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.593
could potentially be funding terrorism.

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:28.409
When a site is looted,

00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:34.213
it's as if a puzzle already missing
90 percent of it pieces

00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:36.999
has had the rest obscured
beyond recognition.

00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:40.028
This is ancient identity theft writ large.

00:09:40.554 --> 00:09:43.046
We know that there are two kinds
of looting going on:

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.756
looting by criminal elements like ISIL,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.646
and then more local looting
by those that are desperate for money.

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:53.311
We would all do the same
to feed our families;

00:09:53.335 --> 00:09:55.484
I don't blame the local looters.

00:09:55.508 --> 00:10:00.186
I blame the middlemen,
the unethical traffickers

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.194
and an international art market

00:10:02.218 --> 00:10:07.609
that exploits often ambiguous
or even completely nonexistent laws.

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:13.141
We know looting is going on
on a global scale and it's increasing,

00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:16.249
but presently we don't have
any tools to stop it.

00:10:16.942 --> 00:10:18.437
This is beginning to change.

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:23.560
My team and I have just completed a study
looking at looting in Egypt.

00:10:23.584 --> 00:10:25.931
We looked at open-source data

00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:28.890
and mapped the entirety
of looting across Egypt

00:10:28.914 --> 00:10:31.457
from 2002 to 2013.

00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:36.850
We found evidence of looting
and site destruction at 267 sites,

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:40.851
and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.

00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:42.894
It's astonishing.

00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:44.591
And putting that data together --

00:10:44.615 --> 00:10:47.110
you can see the looting pits marked here.

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:53.553
At one site, the looting got bad
from 2009, 2011, 2012 --

00:10:53.577 --> 00:10:55.138
hundreds and hundreds of pits.

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:57.035
Putting all the data together,

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:00.110
what we found is that,
contrary to popular opinion,

00:11:00.134 --> 00:11:05.195
looting did not start to get worse
in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,

00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:08.811
but in 2009, after the global recession.

00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:11.980
Thus, we've shown with big data

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:15.467
that looting is fundamentally
an economic issue.

00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:19.969
If we do nothing to stop the problem,

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:24.052
all of Egypt's sites will be affected
by looting by 2040.

00:11:24.504 --> 00:11:27.676
Thus, we are at a tipping point.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.823
We are the generation with all the tools
and all the technologies

00:11:30.847 --> 00:11:32.057
to stop looting,

00:11:32.081 --> 00:11:34.574
but we're not working fast enough.

00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:42.343
Sometimes an archaeological site
can surprise you with its resilience.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:45.589
I am just back from the field,

00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:49.192
where I co-led a joint mission
with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities

00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:51.028
at a site called Lisht.

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:55.874
This site dates to the Middle Kingdom
of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:59.069
The Middle Kingdom was Ancient
Egypt's Renaissance period.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:02.997
After a time of intense internal strife
and environmental challenges,

00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:04.275
Egypt rebounded

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:09.256
with an incredible resurgence
of art, architecture and literature.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.678
It's a favorite period of time
to study in Egypt,

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:15.908
because it teaches us so much
about how we can survive and thrive

00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:17.147
after great disasters.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:22.276
Now at this site, we had already mapped
countless looting pits.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.463
Lisht is a royal site;

00:12:23.487 --> 00:12:26.161
there would have been thousands
of people buried there

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:28.299
who lived and worked
at the court of Pharaoh.

00:12:28.323 --> 00:12:31.491
You can see this before and after;
you see dozens of looting pits.

00:12:31.515 --> 00:12:32.687
North Lisht.

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.174
This is in South Lisht, before and after.

00:12:36.787 --> 00:12:38.292
When we first visited the site,

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:40.920
we could see the tombs
of many high-ranking officials

00:12:40.944 --> 00:12:42.284
that had been looted.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.292
Let me put into perspective
for you what was taken.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.995
Imagine a two meter by two meter area
full of coffins, jewelry

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:52.529
and incredible statuary.

00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:55.883
Multiply that times over a thousand.

00:12:57.122 --> 00:12:58.589
That's what was taken.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.728
So, when we started work,

00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:03.904
my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,
approached me and said,

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:06.189
"We must work at this one particular tomb.

00:13:06.763 --> 00:13:08.522
It's been attacked by looters.

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:10.562
If we don't do anything, they'll be back."

00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:13.982
Of course I agreed,
but I didn't think we'd find anything.

00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:16.128
I thought the looters
had stolen everything.

00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:19.149
What we started to find
were the most incredible reliefs.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:21.339
Look at this painting --
it's just stunning.

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:24.018
We started finding engraved inscriptions.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.113
And even the titles of the tomb owner --

00:13:26.137 --> 00:13:28.448
he had titles like,
"Overseer of the Army,"

00:13:28.472 --> 00:13:29.899
"Overseer of the Treasury."

00:13:29.923 --> 00:13:31.113
I began to have hope.

00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:35.124
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.135
For the ancient Egyptians, having
their name last for eternity

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:39.377
was their goal.

00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:41.789
And then one day,

00:13:41.813 --> 00:13:42.994
this appeared.

00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:47.477
This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:50.655
You can see it written out
here, in hieroglyphs.

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:53.435
Working together with my Egyptian team,

00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:57.421
we had restored someone's name
from 3,900 years ago.

00:13:57.762 --> 00:14:04.635
(Applause)

00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:07.738
Working together
with my Egyptian colleagues,

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:10.040
we celebrated this moment
of shared discovery.

00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:12.602
What we were doing together
was right and true.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.869
We found this incredible
false door, mostly intact.

00:14:15.893 --> 00:14:19.017
On it we read about Intef
and his inscriptions.

00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:21.651
You can actually even see him seated here.

00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:27.685
What I realized is that everything
I had assumed about looted sites

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:28.921
had been proven wrong.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.725
Every day on site we worked
together with 70 Egyptians

00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:34.829
as colleagues and friends.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.345
In the face of so much
hatred and ignorance

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:40.369
against those in the Middle East,

00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:44.112
every moment on site felt like
a protest for peace.

00:14:45.146 --> 00:14:47.497
When you work with those
that don't look like you,

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.613
or think like you, or speak like you,

00:14:49.637 --> 00:14:52.517
your shared mission
of archaeological discovery

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:55.477
erases all superficial differences.

00:14:56.888 --> 00:14:58.428
What I learned this season

00:14:58.452 --> 00:15:01.068
is that archaeology
isn't about what you find.

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:04.312
It's about what you can prove possible.

00:15:05.193 --> 00:15:08.330
Sometimes when you travel,
you end up finding long-lost family --

00:15:08.354 --> 00:15:10.861
not those with whom you share genes,

00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:12.876
but a shared entry in the book of life.

00:15:13.404 --> 00:15:16.028
This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:21.377
Omer's a Gufti from a village
just North of Luxor, called Guft.

00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:24.022
Guftis are part of a celebrated
tradition in Egyptology.

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:26.815
They help with digging
and work crew organization.

00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:29.751
Omer is my COO and CFO.

00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:31.800
I simply couldn't do work without him.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:36.364
One day many years ago,
when I was a young graduate student

00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:40.471
and Omer was a young Gufti
who couldn't speak much English,

00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:42.471
we learned, completely randomly,

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:44.941
that we were born in the same year,

00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:47.410
the same month

00:15:47.434 --> 00:15:51.074
and the same day, six hours apart.

00:15:52.438 --> 00:15:53.589
Twins.

00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:55.007
(Laughter)

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:58.154
Separated by an ocean,
but forever connected

00:15:58.178 --> 00:16:00.251
for Ancient Egypt is our mother.

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:03.060
I knew then we'd always work together --

00:16:03.084 --> 00:16:04.441
not in my brain,

00:16:05.337 --> 00:16:09.834
but in the part of your soul that knows
not everything can be explained.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.697
(Arabic) Omer by brother,

00:16:14.563 --> 00:16:17.482
I will always love you.

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:21.707
(English) Omer my brother,
I will always love you.

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:25.299
So, just before my first dig in Egypt,

00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:29.017
my mentor, the very famous Egyptologist
Professor William Kelly Simpson,

00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:30.336
called me into his office.

00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:34.226
He handed me a check for $2,000,

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.924
and said, "This is to cover your expenses.

00:16:36.948 --> 00:16:39.052
Have a glorious adventure this summer.

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:42.957
Someday you will do this
for someone else."

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:48.092
Thus, my TED Prize wish
is partial payback, plus interest --

00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:49.370
(Laughter)

00:16:49.394 --> 00:16:53.551
for a great human being's
generosity and kindness.

00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:56.796
So, my wish.

00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:03.322
I wish for us to discover the millions
of unknown archaeological sites

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:04.957
around the world.

00:17:04.981 --> 00:17:09.419
By creating a 21st-century army
of global explorers,

00:17:09.443 --> 00:17:12.463
we'll find and protect
the world's hidden heritage,

00:17:12.487 --> 00:17:17.098
which contains clues
to humankind's collective resilience

00:17:17.122 --> 00:17:18.432
and creativity.

00:17:19.284 --> 00:17:20.950
(Applause)

00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:22.164
Thank you.

00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:25.160
(Applause)

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:32.135
So how are we going to do this?

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:36.291
We are going to build
with the TED Prize money

00:17:36.315 --> 00:17:40.373
an online, crowdsource,
citizen science platform

00:17:40.397 --> 00:17:44.683
to allow anyone in the world
to engage with discovering

00:17:44.707 --> 00:17:46.134
archaeological sites.

00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:51.289
There are only a couple hundred of us
space archaeologists around the world.

00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:53.984
It is my dream to engage the world

00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:56.526
with helping to find sites
and protect them.

00:17:57.492 --> 00:18:00.623
What you'll do is sign in,
create a username --

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:03.308
note that this particular username
is already taken.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.190
(Laughter)

00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:07.375
You'll take a tutorial
and you'll start work.

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:08.814
I want to note at the outset

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.933
that in no way will be sharing
GPS data or mapping data for sites.

00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:15.460
We want to treat them
like human patient data,

00:18:15.484 --> 00:18:17.247
and not reveal their locations.

00:18:17.817 --> 00:18:22.039
You'll then be dealt a card from a deck --
20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters,

00:18:22.063 --> 00:18:24.285
and you'll be looking for features.

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:26.279
My team and I will have batch-processed

00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:28.806
large amounts of satellite data
using algorithms

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.373
in order for you to find things,

00:18:30.397 --> 00:18:32.272
so you'll be doing really good science.

00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:33.862
You'll then be starting to look.

00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:35.808
What do you see? Do you see a temple?

00:18:35.832 --> 00:18:38.768
Do you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?

00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:42.324
Do you see any potential
site damage or site looting?

00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:44.454
You'll then begin to mark what's there.

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:47.972
And off to the side are always
going to be rich examples

00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:50.941
of exactly what you're seeing,
to help guide you.

00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:55.412
All the data that you help us collect
will be shared with vetted authorities,

00:18:55.436 --> 00:18:58.632
and will help create
a new global alarm system

00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:00.435
to help protect sites.

00:19:01.372 --> 00:19:03.296
But it's not just going to stop there.

00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:07.482
All the archaeologists with whom
we share your discoveries

00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:11.236
will take you with them
as they begin to excavate them,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.422
by using Periscope, Google Plus
and social media.

00:19:17.218 --> 00:19:20.272
A hundred years ago,
archaeology was for the rich.

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:23.000
Fifty years ago,

00:19:23.024 --> 00:19:24.202
it was for men.

00:19:24.675 --> 00:19:26.948
Now it's primarily for academics.

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:32.330
Our goal is to democratize the process
of archaeological discovery,

00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:34.915
and allow anyone to participate.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.883
Ninety-four years ago,

00:19:37.907 --> 00:19:40.697
Howard Carter discovered
the tomb of King Tut.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.856
Who is the next Howard Carter?

00:19:45.543 --> 00:19:46.895
It might be you.

00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:51.526
By creating this platform,

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:56.275
we will find the millions of places
occupied by the billions of people

00:19:56.299 --> 00:19:57.725
that came before us.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.732
If we want to answer
the big questions about who we are

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:03.017
and where we've come from,

00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:07.480
the answers to those questions
do not lie in pyramids or palaces,

00:20:07.504 --> 00:20:11.552
but in the cities and villages
of those that came before us.

00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:14.972
If we want to learn about the past,

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:17.414
it's time we inverted the pyramids.

00:20:19.098 --> 00:20:22.618
Acknowledging that the past
is worth saving

00:20:22.642 --> 00:20:24.182
means so much more.

00:20:25.532 --> 00:20:29.099
It means that we're worth saving, too.

00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:33.818
And the greatest story ever told

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.900
is the story of our shared human journey.

00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:42.645
But the only way we're going

00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:45.540

Come with me.

00:20:48.778 --> 00:20:49.930
Thank you.

00:20:49.954 --> 00:20:53.654
(Applause)
