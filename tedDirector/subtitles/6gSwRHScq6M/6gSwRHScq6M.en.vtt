00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but let's kick off the afternoon

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
with a message

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
from a mystery sponsor.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Anonymous: Dear Fox News,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
it has come to our unfortunate attention

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that both the name and nature of Anonymous

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
has been ravaged.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
We are everyone. We are no one.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
We are anonymous. We are legion.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
We do not forgive. We do not forget.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
We are but the base of chaos.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
a sophisticated group

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
of politically motivated hackers

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
who have emerged in 2011.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And they're pretty scary.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
You never know when they're going to attack next,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
who or what the consequences will be.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But interestingly,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
they have a sense of humor.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to announce President Obama's assassination.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in the newsroom at Fox.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
"What do we do now?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
(Laughter)

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And of course, who could escape the irony

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
being a victim of hacking for a change.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
(Laughter)

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
(Applause)

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Sometimes you turn on the news

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Sony Playstation Network -- done,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
the government of Turkey -- tick,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
the CIA -- falling off a log.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
told me the other day

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that there are two types of companies in the world:

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I mean three companies

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
providing cybersecurity services to the FBI

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
have been hacked.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and they would say this themselves --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
they are providing a service

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
by demonstrating how useless companies are

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
at protecting our data.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
they are ideologically driven.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
They claim that they are battling

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
a dastardly conspiracy.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
They say that governments are trying

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
to take over the Internet and control it,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and that they, Anonymous,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
are the authentic voice of resistance --

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
against global media corporations,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
or against intelligence agencies,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
or whoever it is.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Okay, they're a little inchoate.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
There's a strong whiff

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of half-baked anarchism about them.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But one thing is true:

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
we are at the beginning

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
of a mighty struggle

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
for control of the Internet.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
The Web links everything,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and very soon

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
it will mediate most human activity.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Because the Internet has fashioned

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
a new and complicated environment

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
for an old-age dilemma

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that pits the demands of security

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
with the desire for freedom.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Now this is a very complicated struggle.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
we probably can't understand it very well.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Nonetheless,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
in an unexpected attack of hubris

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
a couple of years ago,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I decided I would try and do that.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And I sort of get it.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
These were the various things that I was looking at

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
as I was trying to understand it.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
But in order to try and explain the whole thing,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and let me assure you that all of these issues

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
one way or the other,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
but in a configuration

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
trying to get his head around.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So there you are.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And as you see, in the middle,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
there is our old friend, the hacker.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
The hacker is absolutely central

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
to many of the political, social

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and economic issues affecting the Net.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And so I thought to myself,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And what do you know,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
nobody else does talk to the hackers.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
They're completely anonymous, as it were.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So despite the fact

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
that we are beginning to pour billions,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
hundreds of billions of dollars,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
into cybersecurity --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
for the most extraordinary technical solutions --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
no one wants to talk

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
to these guys, the hackers,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
who are doing everything.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
which cost a huge amount of money.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And so nothing is going into the hackers.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Well, I say nothing,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
in Turin, Italy

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
called the Hackers Profiling Project.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And they are doing some fantastic research

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
into the characteristics,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
into the abilities

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and the socialization of hackers.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
But because they're a U.N. operation,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
maybe that's why governments and corporations

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
are not that interested in them.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Because it's a U.N. operation,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
of course, it lacks funding.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
But I think they're doing very important work.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Because where we have a surplus of technology

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in the cybersecurity industry,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
we have a definite lack of --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
call me old-fashioned --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
human intelligence.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Now, so far I've mentioned

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
the hackers Anonymous

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
who are a politically motivated hacking group.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Of course, the criminal justice system

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
treats them as common old garden criminals.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
But interestingly,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
for financial gain.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
But what about the real cybercriminals?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Well real organized crime on the Internet

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
goes back about 10 years

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.260
when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
developed a website,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
which led to the industrialization

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
of cybercrime.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is how they were advertising themselves

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
a decade ago on the Net.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Cybercriminals would go there

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to buy and sell stolen credit card details,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
to exchange information

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
about new malware that was out there.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And remember, this is a time

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
when we're seeing for the first time

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
so-called off-the-shelf malware.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
which you can deploy

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
for cybercriminals.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And its creators

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
because they were faced

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And that challenge is:

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
How do you do business,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
how do you trust

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
somebody on the Web who you want to do business with

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
when you know that they're a criminal?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
(Laughter)

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
It's axiomatic that they're dodgy,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and they're going to want to try and rip you off.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
came up with this brilliant idea

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
called the escrow system.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
They appointed an officer

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
The purchaser would send the administrative officer

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
some dollars digitally,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And the officer would then verify

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
if the stolen credit card worked.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And if they did,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
he then passed on the money to the vendor

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And it was this

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.260
which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And after that, it just went wild.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
We had a champagne decade

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
for people who we know as Carders.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Now I spoke to one of these Carders

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
who we'll call RedBrigade --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
although that wasn't even his proper nickname --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
he would go on sprees in New York,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
taking out $10,000 from an ATM here,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
$30,000 from an ATM there,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
using cloned credit cards.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
He was making, on average a week,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
$150,000 --

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
tax free of course.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And he said

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
that he had so much money

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that he just didn't know what to do with it

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and actually fell into a depression.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
But that's a slightly different story,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
which I won't go into now.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
He sort of understood the technology,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and he realized that security was very important

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
if you were going to be a Carder,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
but he didn't spend his days and nights

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
bent over a computer, eating pizza,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
drinking coke and that sort of thing.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
He was out there on the town

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
having a fab time enjoying the high life.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And this is because

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
hackers are only one element

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
in a cybercriminal enterprise.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And I want to explain this to you

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
by introducing you to six characters

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
who I met

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
while I was doing this research.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT --

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Now he developed his social and moral compass

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This was a sink-or-swim environment

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.260
where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
was entirely necessary

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
if you wanted to survive.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
As an accomplished computer user,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
what Dimitry did

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
onto the Worldwide Web.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And he did a great job in it.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
You have to understand though

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that from his ninth birthday,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
the only environment he knew

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
was gangsterism.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
He knew no other way of making a living

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and making money.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
aka JiLsi --

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
founder of DarkMarket,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
As an eight year-old,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
accused of being a terrorist,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and his parents sent him on his own to Britain

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
as a refugee seeking political asylum.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
At 13,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
with only little English and being bullied at school,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
he escaped into a world of computers

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
where he showed great technical ability,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
but he was soon being seduced

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
by people on the Internet.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
in 2012.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Matrix001,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
who was an administrator at DarkMarket.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Born in Southern Germany

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
to a stable and well-respected middle class family,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
his obsession with gaming as a teenager

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
led him to hacking.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
where he stored his games

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
that he had cracked and pirated.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
His slide into criminality

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
was incremental.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And when he finally woke up to his situation

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and understood the implications,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
he was already in too deep.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN --

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
mastermind of CardersMarket.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Born in Meridian, Idaho.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
working out of Santa Clara, California

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
in the late 90s for private companies

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and voluntarily for the FBI.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Now in the late 1990s,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
he discovered a vulnerability

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
on all U.S. government networks,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and he went in and patched it up --

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
because this included nuclear research facilities --

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
sparing the American government

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
a huge security embarrassment.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
he left a tiny digital wormhole

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
through which he alone could crawl.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and he was convicted.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
At his open prison,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
he came under the influence of financial fraudsters,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and those financial fraudsters

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
persuaded him to work for them

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
on his release.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
And this man with a planetary-sized brain

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
is now serving a 13-year sentence

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
in California.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
master bank account cracker

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
from Abuja in Nigeria.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.260
bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
before arriving in Britain

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
in 2005

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
to take a Masters in chemical engineering

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
at Manchester University.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
He impressed in the private sector,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
developing chemical applications for the oil industry

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
while simultaneously running

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.260
until his arrest in 2008.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
aka Cha0 --

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
one of the most remarkable hackers ever,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
from Ankara in Turkey.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.260
with the suave social engineering skills

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
of the master criminal.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
One of the smartest people I've ever met.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
He also had the most effective

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
virtual private network security arrangement

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
the police have ever encountered

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
amongst global cybercriminals.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Now the important thing

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
about all of these people

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
is they share certain characteristics

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.260
despite the fact that they come from very different environments.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
They are all people who learned their hacking skills

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
in their early to mid-teens.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
They are all people

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
who demonstrate advanced ability

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
in maths and the sciences.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.260
their moral compass had not yet developed.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.260
they did not demonstrate

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
any real social skills in the outside world --

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
only on the Web.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And the other thing is

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
the high incidence of hackers like these

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
who have characteristics which are consistent

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
with Asperger's syndrome.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Now I discussed this

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And he has done path-breaking work on autism

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and confirmed, also for the authorities here,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
that Gary McKinnon --

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
who is wanted by the United States

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
for hacking into the Pentagon --

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
suffers from Asperger's

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and a secondary condition

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
of depression.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
And Baron-Cohen explained

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
that certain disabilities

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
as tremendous skills,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and that we should not be throwing in jail

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
people who have such disabilities and skills

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
because they have lost their way socially

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
or been duped.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Now I think we're missing a trick here,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
And let me be blunt about this.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
this is exactly what they are doing.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
They are recruiting hackers

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
both before and after they become involved

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
in criminal and industrial espionage activities --

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
are mobilizing them

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
on behalf of the state.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
We need to engage

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and find ways of offering guidance

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
to these young people,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
because they are a remarkable breed.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
And if we rely, as we do at the moment,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
solely on the criminal justice system

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
and the threat of punitive sentences,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Thank you very much for listening.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:48.260
(Applause)

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
Chris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
is hire hackers.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.260
How would someone get over that kind of fear

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
that the hacker they hire

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
might preserve that little teensy wormhole?

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
MG: I think to an extent,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
you have to understand

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
They're just relentless and obsessive

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
about what they do.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
But all of the people who I've spoken to

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
who have fallen foul of the law,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
to work in the legitimate industry.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
We want to work with you."

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
(Applause)
