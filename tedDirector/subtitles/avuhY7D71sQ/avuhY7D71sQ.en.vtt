00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.132
So you go to the doctor
and get some tests.

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:19.294
The doctor determines
that you have high cholesterol

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:22.489
and you would benefit
from medication to treat it.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.537
So you get a pillbox.

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:26.704
You have some confidence,

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:29.665
your physician has some confidence
that this is going to work.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.242
The company that invented it did
a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.373
They studied it very carefully,
skeptically, they approved it.

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:38.286
They have a rough idea of how it works,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.763
they have a rough idea
of what the side effects are.

00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:41.937
It should be OK.

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:45.682
You have a little more
of a conversation with your physician

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:48.669
and the physician is a little worried
because you've been blue,

00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:49.986
haven't felt like yourself,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.741
you haven't been able to enjoy things
in life quite as much as you usually do.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.951
Your physician says, "You know,
I think you have some depression.

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:00.107
I'm going to have to give
you another pill."

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:03.417
So now we're talking
about two medications.

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.545
This pill also -- millions
of people have taken it,

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:10.200
the company did studies,
the FDA looked at it -- all good.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:12.880
Think things should go OK.

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:15.101
Think things should go OK.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.564
Well, wait a minute.

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:20.105
How much have we studied
these two together?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.930
Well, it's very hard to do that.

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:25.084
In fact, it's not traditionally done.

00:01:25.108 --> 00:01:30.626
We totally depend on what we call
"post-marketing surveillance,"

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.530
after the drugs hit the market.

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:35.844
How can we figure out
if bad things are happening

00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:37.225
between two medications?

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.279
Three? Five? Seven?

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.123
Ask your favorite person
who has several diagnoses

00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:43.981
how many medications they're on.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.110
Why do I care about this problem?

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:47.291
I care about it deeply.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:51.619
I'm an informatics and data science guy
and really, in my opinion,

00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:55.388
the only hope -- only hope --
to understand these interactions

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:58.468
is to leverage lots
of different sources of data

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:02.048
in order to figure out
when drugs can be used together safely

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:03.849
and when it's not so safe.

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:06.666
So let me tell you a data science story.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.844
And it begins with my student Nick.

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:11.248
Let's call him "Nick,"
because that's his name.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:12.864
(Laughter)

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:14.089
Nick was a young student.

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:17.192
I said, "You know, Nick, we have
to understand how drugs work

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:19.842
and how they work together
and how they work separately,

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.788
and we don't have a great understanding.

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:24.217
But the FDA has made available
an amazing database.

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.940
It's a database of adverse events.

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:27.963
They literally put on the web --

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:31.106
publicly available, you could all
download it right now --

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.757
hundreds of thousands
of adverse event reports

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:38.541
from patients, doctors,
companies, pharmacists.

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:40.314
And these reports are pretty simple:

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:42.996
it has all the diseases
that the patient has,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.787
all the drugs that they're on,

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:48.629
and all the adverse events,
or side effects, that they experience.

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:52.089
It is not all of the adverse events
that are occurring in America today,

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:54.691
but it's hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of drugs.

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:56.014
So I said to Nick,

00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:57.864
"Let's think about glucose.

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:01.455
Glucose is very important,
and we know it's involved with diabetes.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.449
Let's see if we can understand
glucose response.

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:07.931
I sent Nick off. Nick came back.

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:10.034
"Russ," he said,

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:15.463
"I've created a classifier that can
look at the side effects of a drug

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.538
based on looking at this database,

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.833
and can tell you whether that drug
is likely to change glucose or not."

00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:23.873
He did it. It was very simple, in a way.

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:26.532
He took all the drugs
that were known to change glucose

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:28.945
and a bunch of drugs
that don't change glucose,

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.857
and said, "What's the difference
in their side effects?

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:36.733
Differences in fatigue? In appetite?
In urination habits?"

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:39.717
All those things conspired
to give him a really good predictor.

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:42.289
He said, "Russ, I can predict
with 93 percent accuracy

00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:43.885
when a drug will change glucose."

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.325
I said, "Nick, that's great."

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.245
He's a young student,
you have to build his confidence.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.659
"But Nick, there's a problem.

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:53.643
It's that every physician in the world
knows all the drugs that change glucose,

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.705
because it's core to our practice.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.451
So it's great, good job,
but not really that interesting,

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:01.006
definitely not publishable."

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.044
(Laughter)

00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:04.618
He said, "I know, Russ.
I thought you might say that."

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:05.794
Nick is smart.

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.023
"I thought you might say that,
so I did one other experiment.

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:11.975
I looked at people in this database
who were on two drugs,

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.421
and I looked for signals similar,
glucose-changing signals,

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.069
for people taking two drugs,

00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:23.662
where each drug alone
did not change glucose,

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:26.146
but together I saw a strong signal."

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.319
And I said, "Oh! You're clever.
Good idea. Show me the list."

00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:31.597
And there's a bunch of drugs,
not very exciting.

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:35.553
But what caught my eye
was, on the list there were two drugs:

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:38.970
paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:43.326
and pravastatin, or Pravachol,
a cholesterol medication.

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:48.219
And I said, "Huh. There are millions
of Americans on those two drugs."

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:49.489
In fact, we learned later,

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:55.545
15 million Americans on paroxetine
at the time, 15 million on pravastatin,

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.386
and a million, we estimated, on both.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:00.021
So that's a million people

00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:02.498
who might be having some problems
with their glucose

00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:05.728
if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo
that he did in the FDA database

00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:07.006
actually holds up.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.957
But I said, "It's still not publishable,

00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:11.277
because I love what you did
with the mumbo jumbo,

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:12.547
with the machine learning,

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:16.435
but it's not really standard-of-proof
evidence that we have."

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:19.207
So we have to do something else.

00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:22.107
Let's go into the Stanford
electronic medical record.

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:24.195
We have a copy of it
that's OK for research,

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.265
we removed identifying information.

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.084
And I said, "Let's see if people
on these two drugs

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:30.877
have problems with their glucose."

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:33.449
Now there are thousands
and thousands of people

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.932
in the Stanford medical records
that take paroxetine and pravastatin.

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:38.755
But we needed special patients.

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.376
We needed patients who were on one of them
and had a glucose measurement,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.849
then got the second one and had
another glucose measurement,

00:05:46.873 --> 00:05:50.488
all within a reasonable period of time --
something like two months.

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:53.671
And when we did that,
we found 10 patients.

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:59.130
However, eight out of the 10
had a bump in their glucose

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:01.799
when they got the second P --
we call this P and P --

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:03.133
when they got the second P.

00:06:03.157 --> 00:06:05.719
Either one could be first,
the second one comes up,

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:08.590
glucose went up
20 milligrams per deciliter.

00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:09.772
Just as a reminder,

00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:12.121
you walk around normally,
if you're not diabetic,

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:13.504
with a glucose of around 90.

00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:15.604
And if it gets up to 120, 125,

00:06:15.628 --> 00:06:19.078
your doctor begins to think
about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.

00:06:19.102 --> 00:06:22.093
So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:24.505
I said, "Nick, this is very cool.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:27.669
But, I'm sorry, we still
don't have a paper,

00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:30.272
because this is 10 patients
and -- give me a break --

00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:31.541
it's not enough patients."

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:32.871
So we said, what can we do?

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:35.871
And we said, let's call our friends
at Harvard and Vanderbilt,

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.482
who also -- Harvard in Boston,
Vanderbilt in Nashville,

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:41.327
who also have electronic
medical records similar to ours.

00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:43.371
Let's see if they can find
similar patients

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:46.671
with the one P, the other P,
the glucose measurements

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:48.295
in that range that we need.

00:06:48.787 --> 00:06:53.742
God bless them, Vanderbilt
in one week found 40 such patients,

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:54.955
same trend.

00:06:55.804 --> 00:06:59.424
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.

00:06:59.448 --> 00:07:03.729
So at the end, we had 150 patients
from three diverse medical centers

00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:07.050
that were telling us that patients
getting these two drugs

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:09.777
were having their glucose bump
somewhat significantly.

00:07:10.317 --> 00:07:13.127
More interestingly,
we had left out diabetics,

00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:15.468
because diabetics already
have messed up glucose.

00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:17.730
When we looked
at the glucose of diabetics,

00:07:17.754 --> 00:07:21.189
it was going up 60 milligrams
per deciliter, not just 20.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.212
This was a big deal, and we said,
"We've got to publish this."

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.415
We submitted the paper.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:28.550
It was all data evidence,

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:31.057
data from the FDA, data from Stanford,

00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.027
data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.

00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.447
We had not done a single real experiment.

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:37.791
But we were nervous.

00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:41.931
So Nick, while the paper
was in review, went to the lab.

00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:44.417
We found somebody
who knew about lab stuff.

00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.834
I don't do that.

00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:48.275
I take care of patients,
but I don't do pipettes.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.473
They taught us how to feed mice drugs.

00:07:52.864 --> 00:07:55.278
We took mice and we gave them
one P, paroxetine.

00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:57.810
We gave some other mice pravastatin.

00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:01.429
And we gave a third group
of mice both of them.

00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:05.839
And lo and behold, glucose went up
20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter

00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:07.034
in the mice.

00:08:07.058 --> 00:08:10.216
So the paper was accepted
based on the informatics evidence alone,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.134
but we added a little note at the end,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.057
saying, oh by the way,
if you give these to mice, it goes up.

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:17.589
That was great, and the story
could have ended there.

00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:19.610
But I still have six and a half minutes.

00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:22.441
(Laughter)

00:08:22.465 --> 00:08:25.280
So we were sitting around
thinking about all of this,

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:28.039
and I don't remember who thought
of it, but somebody said,

00:08:28.063 --> 00:08:31.264
"I wonder if patients
who are taking these two drugs

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:34.841
are noticing side effects
of hyperglycemia.

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:36.361
They could and they should.

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:38.638
How would we ever determine that?"

00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:40.994
We said, well, what do you do?

00:08:41.018 --> 00:08:43.598
You're taking a medication,
one new medication or two,

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:45.160
and you get a funny feeling.

00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:46.335
What do you do?

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.510
You go to Google

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:50.883
and type in the two drugs you're taking
or the one drug you're taking,

00:08:50.907 --> 00:08:52.510
and you type in "side effects."

00:08:52.534 --> 00:08:53.890
What are you experiencing?

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:55.390
So we said OK,

00:08:55.414 --> 00:08:58.470
let's ask Google if they will share
their search logs with us,

00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:00.327
so that we can look at the search logs

00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:02.916
and see if patients are doing
these kinds of searches.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.215
Google, I am sorry to say,
denied our request.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:07.970
So I was bummed.

00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:11.160
I was at a dinner with a colleague
who works at Microsoft Research

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.125
and I said, "We wanted to do this study,

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:15.029
Google said no, it's kind of a bummer."

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:17.139
He said, "Well, we have
the Bing searches."

00:09:18.195 --> 00:09:21.678
(Laughter)

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.072
Yeah.

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.247
That's great.

00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:26.422
Now I felt like I was --

00:09:26.446 --> 00:09:27.446
(Laughter)

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.882
I felt like I was talking to Nick again.

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:33.061
He works for one of the largest
companies in the world,

00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:35.291
and I'm already trying
to make him feel better.

00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:37.760
But he said, "No, Russ --
you might not understand.

00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:39.284
We not only have Bing searches,

00:09:39.308 --> 00:09:42.648
but if you use Internet Explorer
to do searches at Google,

00:09:42.672 --> 00:09:44.563
Yahoo, Bing, any ...

00:09:44.587 --> 00:09:48.230
Then, for 18 months, we keep that data
for research purposes only."

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.190
I said, "Now you're talking!"

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.412
This was Eric Horvitz,
my friend at Microsoft.

00:09:52.436 --> 00:09:54.131
So we did a study

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:58.774
where we defined 50 words
that a regular person might type in

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:00.400
if they're having hyperglycemia,

00:10:00.424 --> 00:10:05.186
like "fatigue," "loss of appetite,"
"urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" --

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.977
forgive me, but that's one
of the things you might type in.

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:10.791
So we had 50 phrases
that we called the "diabetes words."

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:12.878
And we did first a baseline.

00:10:12.902 --> 00:10:15.606
And it turns out
that about .5 to one percent

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.612
of all searches on the Internet
involve one of those words.

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:20.378
So that's our baseline rate.

00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:24.545
If people type in "paroxetine"
or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms --

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:25.784
and one of those words,

00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:30.698
the rate goes up to about two percent
of diabetes-type words,

00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:33.766
if you already know
that there's that "paroxetine" word.

00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:38.738
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up
to about three percent from the baseline.

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:43.561
If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin"
are present in the query,

00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:45.254
it goes up to 10 percent,

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.739
a huge three- to four-fold increase

00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:52.152
in those searches with the two drugs
that we were interested in,

00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:55.742
and diabetes-type words
or hyperglycemia-type words.

00:10:56.216 --> 00:10:57.481
We published this,

00:10:57.505 --> 00:10:58.971
and it got some attention.

00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:00.773
The reason it deserves attention

00:11:00.797 --> 00:11:05.109
is that patients are telling us
their side effects indirectly

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:06.289
through their searches.

00:11:06.313 --> 00:11:08.451
We brought this
to the attention of the FDA.

00:11:08.475 --> 00:11:09.744
They were interested.

00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:13.374
They have set up social media
surveillance programs

00:11:13.398 --> 00:11:15.149
to collaborate with Microsoft,

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:17.967
which had a nice infrastructure
for doing this, and others,

00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.273
to look at Twitter feeds,

00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:21.013
to look at Facebook feeds,

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:22.348
to look at search logs,

00:11:22.372 --> 00:11:27.281
to try to see early signs that drugs,
either individually or together,

00:11:27.305 --> 00:11:28.894
are causing problems.

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:31.092
What do I take from this?
Why tell this story?

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.323
Well, first of all,

00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:36.384
we have now the promise
of big data and medium-sized data

00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:39.326
to help us understand drug interactions

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.770
and really, fundamentally, drug actions.

00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:43.207
How do drugs work?

00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:46.067
This will create and has created
a new ecosystem

00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:49.358
for understanding how drugs work
and to optimize their use.

00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:52.962
Nick went on; he's a professor
at Columbia now.

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:57.058
He did this in his PhD
for hundreds of pairs of drugs.

00:11:57.082 --> 00:11:59.599
He found several
very important interactions,

00:11:59.623 --> 00:12:00.837
and so we replicated this

00:12:00.861 --> 00:12:03.435
and we showed that this
is a way that really works

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:05.798
for finding drug-drug interactions.

00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:08.016
However, there's a couple of things.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.086
We don't just use pairs
of drugs at a time.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.579
As I said before, there are patients
on three, five, seven, nine drugs.

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:19.623
Have they been studied with respect
to their nine-way interaction?

00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:23.855
Yes, we can do pair-wise,
A and B, A and C, A and D,

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:28.165
but what about A, B, C,
D, E, F, G all together,

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:29.951
being taken by the same patient,

00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:32.093
perhaps interacting with each other

00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:35.895
in ways that either makes them
more effective or less effective

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:38.251
or causes side effects
that are unexpected?

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:40.102
We really have no idea.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.882
It's a blue sky, open field
for us to use data

00:12:43.906 --> 00:12:46.408
to try to understand
the interaction of drugs.

00:12:46.848 --> 00:12:48.218
Two more lessons:

00:12:48.242 --> 00:12:52.441
I want you to think about the power
that we were able to generate

00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:57.176
with the data from people who had
volunteered their adverse reactions

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.469
through their pharmacists,
through themselves, through their doctors,

00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:04.160
the people who allowed the databases
at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,

00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:05.611
to be used for research.

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:07.374
People are worried about data.

00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:10.585
They're worried about their privacy
and security -- they should be.

00:13:10.609 --> 00:13:11.760
We need secure systems.

00:13:11.784 --> 00:13:15.190
But we can't have a system
that closes that data off,

00:13:15.214 --> 00:13:17.966
because it is too rich of a source

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.961
of inspiration, innovation and discovery

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.563
for new things in medicine.

00:13:24.494 --> 00:13:26.288
And the final thing I want to say is,

00:13:26.312 --> 00:13:29.669
in this case we found two drugs
and it was a little bit of a sad story.

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:31.614
The two drugs actually caused problems.

00:13:31.638 --> 00:13:33.113
They increased glucose.

00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:35.583
They could throw somebody into diabetes

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.901
who would otherwise not be in diabetes,

00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:41.100
and so you would want to use
the two drugs very carefully together,

00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:42.275
perhaps not together,

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.639
make different choices
when you're prescribing.

00:13:44.663 --> 00:13:46.509
But there was another possibility.

00:13:46.533 --> 00:13:48.877
We could have found
two drugs or three drugs

00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:51.162
that were interacting in a beneficial way.

00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:54.328
We could have found new effects of drugs

00:13:54.352 --> 00:13:56.512
that neither of them has alone,

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:59.029
but together, instead
of causing a side effect,

00:13:59.053 --> 00:14:01.478
they could be a new and novel treatment

00:14:01.502 --> 00:14:03.384
for diseases that don't have treatments

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:05.415
or where the treatments are not effective.

00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:07.834
If we think about drug treatment today,

00:14:07.858 --> 00:14:09.610
all the major breakthroughs --

00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:13.931
for HIV, for tuberculosis,
for depression, for diabetes --

00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:16.785
it's always a cocktail of drugs.

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:18.539
And so the upside here,

00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:21.412
and the subject for a different
TED Talk on a different day,

00:14:21.436 --> 00:14:24.029
is how can we use the same data sources

00:14:24.053 --> 00:14:27.616
to find good effects
of drugs in combination

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.815
that will provide us new treatments,

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.691
new insights into how drugs work

00:14:31.715 --> 00:14:35.501
and enable us to take care
of our patients even better?

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:36.691
Thank you very much.

00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:40.214
(Applause)
