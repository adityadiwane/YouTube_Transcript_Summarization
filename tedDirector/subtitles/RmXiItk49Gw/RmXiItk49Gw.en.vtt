00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.736
I was one of the founding members
of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.331
The other founding members
included Ahmed Ahmed,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.306
who is an Egyptian-American,
who actually had the idea

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.609
to go to the Middle East and try it out
before we went out as a tour.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.287
He went out solo and did it first.

00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:33.236
Then there was Aron Kader,
who was the Palestinian-American.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.236
And then there was me,
the Iranian-American of the group.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.256
Now, being Iranian-American
presents its own set of problems,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.451
as you know.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.952
Those two countries
aren't getting along these days.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.236
So it causes a lot of inner
conflict, you know,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.442
like part of me likes me,
part of me hates me.

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.466
(Laughter)

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.847
Part of me thinks I should
have a nuclear program,

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.302
the other part thinks
I can't be trusted with one.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:55.938
These are dilemmas I have every day.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.689
But I was born in Iran;
I'm now an American citizen,

00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:00.689
which means I have the American passport,

00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:02.081
which means I can travel.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.451
Because if you only have
the Iranian passport,

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.976
you're kind of limited to the countries
you can go to with open arms,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.276
you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.700
(Laughter)

00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:17.504
So, anyone who's gotten their passport
in America will tell you,

00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:20.435
when you get it, it still says
what country you were born in.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.494
So I remember getting
my American passport.

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:24.578
I was like, "Woo-hoo!
I'm going to travel."

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:28.128
And I opened it up, it said, "Born
in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"

00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:29.177
(Laughter)

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:30.471
"I'm trying to go places."

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:31.555
(Laughter)

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.821
But what's interesting is,

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:36.357
I've never had trouble in any Western
countries with my American passport,

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.791
even though it says,
"Born in Iran" -- no problems.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.494
Where I've had problems
is in some of the Arab countries.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.999
I guess some of the Arab countries
aren't getting along with Iran either.

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.319
So I was in Kuwait recently,
doing a comedy show

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.038
with some other American comedians.

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:50.215
They all went through.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.837
Then the border patrol saw my American
passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.910
Then he opened it up.
"Born in Iran? Wait."

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:57.470
(Laughter)

00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.190
And he started asking me questions.

00:01:59.214 --> 00:02:01.190
He said, "What is your father's name?"

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:04.753
I said, "Well, he's passed away,
but his name was Khosro."

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:07.182
He goes, "What
is your grandfather's name?"

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:09.250
I said, "He passed away a long time ago.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:10.818
His name was Jabbar."

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:13.398
He says, "You wait. I'll be back,"
and he walked away.

00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:14.715
And I started freaking out,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.759
because I don't know what kind
of crap my grandfather was into.

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:19.991
(Laughter)

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.435
Thought the guy was going
to come back and be like,

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.508
"We've been looking
for you for 200 years."

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:27.434
(Laughter)

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.599
"Your grandfather has
a parking violation. It's way overdue.

00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.814
You owe us two billion dollars."

00:02:32.838 --> 00:02:34.306
(Laughter)

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:37.687
But as you can see, when I talk,
I speak with an American accent,

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:40.338
which you would think,
as an Iranian-American actor,

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:43.237
I should be able to play any part,
good, bad, what have you.

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.842
But a lot of times in Hollywood,

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:47.932
when casting directors find out
you're of Middle Eastern descent,

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.675
they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.378
Can you say 'I will kill you
in the name of Allah?'"

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.821
I go, "I could say that,
but what if I were to say,

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:56.236
'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.891
They go, "Great! And then
you hijack the hospital."

00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:03.676
(Laughter)

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:06.532
Like, I think you're
missing the point here.

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:09.530
Don't get me wrong,
I don't mind playing bad guys.

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:11.753
I want to play a bad guy.
I want to rob a bank.

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:13.583
I want to rob a bank in a film,

00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:16.880
but do it with a gun, not with a bomb
strapped around me, right?

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:18.120
(Laughter)

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:21.118
Because I imagine the director:
"Maz, I think your character

00:03:21.142 --> 00:03:23.236
would rob the bank
with a bomb around him."

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:25.195
"Why would I do that?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.236
If I want the money,
why would I kill myself?"

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.351
(Laughter)

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:32.551
Right?

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:35.510
(Applause)

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.921
"Gimme all your money,
or I'll blow myself up!"

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:41.698
(Laughter)

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.540
"Well, then blow yourself up.

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:44.714
(Laughter)

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.392
Just do it outside, please."

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:49.941
(Laughter)

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.522
But the fact is, there's good
people everywhere.

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:55.662
That's what I try and show in my stand-up,
good people everywhere.

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:57.647
All it takes in one person to mess it up.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.149
Like a couple months ago
in Times Square in New York,

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:03.233
there was a Pakistani Muslim guy
who tried to blow up a car bomb.

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:06.499
Now, I happened to be in Times Square
that night doing a comedy show.

00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:10.149
And a few months before that, there
was a white American guy in Austin, Texas

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:12.780
who flew his airplane
into the IRS building,

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:17.236
and I happened to be in Austin that day
doing a stand-up comedy show.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.356
Now I'll tell you,
as a Middle-Eastern male,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.124
when you show up around a lot
of these activities,

00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.094
you start feeling guilty at one point.

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:25.119
(Laughter)

00:04:25.143 --> 00:04:28.232
I was watching the news. I'm like,
"Am I involved in this crap?"

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:33.156
(Laughter)

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.362
"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:37.311
(Laughter)

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:38.728
But what was interesting was,

00:04:38.752 --> 00:04:41.763
the Pakistani Muslim guy --
see, he gives a bad name to Muslims

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:44.697
and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis
from all over the world.

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:47.818
And one thing that happened there
was also the Pakistani Taliban

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:49.901
took credit for that failed car bombing.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.534
My question is: Why would you take credit
for a failed car bombing?

00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:56.092
"We just want to say:

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.979
we tried."

00:04:58.003 --> 00:05:01.027
(Laughter)

00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:03.888
"And furthermore ...

00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:05.061
(Laughter)

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:06.684
it is the thought that counts."

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.406
(Laughter)

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.152
(Applause)

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.370
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."

00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:19.435
(Laughter)

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:23.009
But what happened was, when the white guy
flew his plane into the building,

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.898
I know all my Middle Eastern
and Muslim friends in the States

00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:27.078
were watching TV, going,

00:05:27.102 --> 00:05:30.162
"Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
Don't be Hassan or Hussein."

00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:34.370
And the name came out: Jack.
I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!"

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.045
But I kept watching the news
in case they came back,

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.855
and were like, "Before he did it,
he converted to Islam."

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.414
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"

00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:45.506
But the fact is, I've been lucky

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.698
to get a chance to perform
all over the world,

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.831
and I did a lot of shows
in the Middle East.

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:51.648
I just did a seven-country solo tour.

00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:53.990
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:55.236
I was in Dubai.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.459
And it's great, there's good
people everywhere.

00:05:57.483 --> 00:05:59.634
And you learn great things
about these places.

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:02.082
I encourage people always
to go visit these places.

00:06:02.106 --> 00:06:03.684
For example, Dubai -- cool place.

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:07.268
They're obsessed with having the biggest,
tallest, longest, as we all know.

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:09.214
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:11.337
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.

00:06:11.928 --> 00:06:15.563
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!"
I'm like, "What are you doing here?"

00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:18.483
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store.
It's three miles away.

00:06:18.507 --> 00:06:20.811
Out of my way. Out of my way.
Out of my way."

00:06:20.835 --> 00:06:22.085
(Laughter)

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:25.177
And what's crazy -- there's a recession
going on, even in Dubai,

00:06:25.201 --> 00:06:26.975
but you wouldn't know by the prices.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.271
Like in the Dubai Mall,
they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.

00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:32.539
It's like a drug deal.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.236
I was walking by. The guy goes,
"Psst! Habibi, my friend."

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.400
(Laughter)

00:06:38.424 --> 00:06:40.053
"You want some frozen yogurt?

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:41.624
(Laughter)

00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:43.294
Come here. Come here. Come here.

00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:46.849
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram.
How many gram do you want?"

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:47.913
(Laughter)

00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:51.236
I bought five grams. 10 dollars.
10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.000
He's like, "Good stuff, man.
Colombian. Top of the line."

00:06:54.024 --> 00:06:55.062
(Laughter)

00:06:55.086 --> 00:06:57.964
The other thing you learn
when you travel in these countries,

00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:00.864
in the Middle East, Latin American,
South American countries,

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:04.236
a lot of times when they build stuff,
there's no rules and regulations.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.896
For example, I took my two-year-old son
to the playground at the Dubai Mall.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.831
And I've taken him to playgrounds
all over the United States.

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:14.052
And when you put your two-year-old
on a slide in the United States,

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.991
they put something on the slide

00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:18.571
to slow the kid down
as he comes down the slide.

00:07:19.103 --> 00:07:20.693
Not in the Middle East.

00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:22.693
(Laughter)

00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:26.413
I put my two-year-old on the slide,
he went whoosh! He took off!

00:07:26.437 --> 00:07:27.539
(Laughter)

00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:31.178
I went down and, "Where's my son?"
"On the third floor, sir. Third floor."

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.116
(Laughter)

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.499
"You take a taxi.
You go to Zara. Make a left."

00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:37.249
(Laughter)

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.800
"Try the yogurt. It's very good.
Little expensive."

00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:42.907
(Laughter)

00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:45.977
But one thing I try to do
with my stand-up is break stereotypes.

00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:48.114
And I've been guilty
of stereotyping as well.

00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:51.102
I was in Dubai. And there's a lot
of Indians who work in Dubai.

00:07:51.126 --> 00:07:52.757
And they don't get paid that well.

00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.658
And I got it in my head that all
the Indians must be workers.

00:07:55.682 --> 00:07:58.496
I forgot there's obviously
successful Indians in Dubai too.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.937
I was doing a show, and they said,
"We'll send a driver to pick you up."

00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:04.331
I went down to the lobby,
and saw this Indian guy.

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:05.748
I go, "He must be my driver,"

00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:09.181
since he's standing there in a cheap
suit, thin mustache, staring at me.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:11.059
I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:12.860
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."

00:08:12.884 --> 00:08:16.003
(Laughter)

00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:19.572
I go, "I'm sorry!
Why were you staring at me?"

00:08:19.596 --> 00:08:21.638
He goes, "I thought you were my driver."

00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:24.172
(Laughter)

00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:31.196
(Applause)

00:08:32.473 --> 00:08:35.398
(Laughter)

00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:38.803
I'll leave you with this: I try,
with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,

00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:41.587
present Middle Easterners
and Muslims in a positive light.

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:43.186
I hope that in the coming years,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.891
more film and television programs
come out of Hollywood,

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:47.693
presenting us in a positive light.

00:08:47.717 --> 00:08:51.223
Who knows? Maybe one day,
we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:52.830
"My name is Bond.

00:08:52.854 --> 00:08:54.015
Jamal Bond."

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.482
(Laughter)

00:08:55.506 --> 00:08:58.229
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
Hope you keep laughing.

00:08:58.253 --> 00:08:59.550
Have a good day. Thank you.

00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:06.574
(Applause)
