00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.960
A few years ago,

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:17.444
I got one of those spam emails.

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:19.572
And it managed
to get through my spam filter.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:22.152
I'm not quite sure how,
but it turned up in my inbox,

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:24.325
and it was from a guy
called Solomon Odonkoh.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.564
(Laughter)

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.310
I know.

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:28.564
(Laughter)

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:29.748
It went like this:

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:31.390
it said, "Hello James Veitch,

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.953
I have an interesting business proposal
I want to share with you, Solomon."

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.159
Now, my hand was kind of hovering
on the delete button, right?

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:42.142
I was looking at my phone.
I thought, I could just delete this.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.607
Or I could do what I think
we've all always wanted to do.

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.622
(Laughter)

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.750
And I said, "Solomon,
Your email intrigues me."

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:55.476
(Laughter)

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.476
(Applause)

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.920
And the game was afoot.

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:08.175
He said, "Dear James Veitch,
We shall be shipping Gold to you."

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:09.896
(Laughter)

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.199
"You will earn 10%
of any gold you distributes."

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:14.987
(Laughter)

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.358
So I knew I was dealing
with a professional.

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:20.957
(Laughter)

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:23.892
I said, "How much is it worth?"

00:01:25.058 --> 00:01:27.558
He said, "We will start
with smaller quantity," --

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:28.734
I was like, aww --

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:31.552
and then he said, "of 25 kgs.

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.576
(Laughter)

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.433
The worth should be about $2.5 million."

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.211
I said, "Solomon, if we're
going to do it, let's go big.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:49.137
(Applause)

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:54.191
I can handle it.
How much gold do you have?"

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.302
(Laughter)

00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.361
He said, "It is not a matter
of how much gold I have,

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:02.436
what matters is
your capability of handling.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.683
We can start with 50 kgs
as trial shipment."

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.578
I said, "50 kgs?

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:08.245
There's no point doing this at all

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.499
unless you're shipping
at least a metric ton."

00:02:10.523 --> 00:02:11.718
(Laughter)

00:02:11.742 --> 00:02:14.511
(Applause)

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.324
He said, "What do you do for a living?"

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.203
(Laughter)

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:22.625
I said, "I'm a hedge fund
executive bank manager."

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.057
(Laughter)

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.953
This isn't the first time
I've shipped bullion, my friend,

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.638
no no no.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.140
Then I started to panic.

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:35.792
I was like, "Where are you based?"

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:36.998
I don't know about you,

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.390
but I think if we're going
via the postal service,

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:40.722
it ought to be signed for.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:41.920
That's a lot of gold."

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:45.103
He said, "It will not be easy
to convince my company

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:46.837
to do larger quantity shipment."

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.389
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely
with you on this one.

00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:52.859
I'm putting together a visual for you
to take into the board meeting.

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:54.063
Hold tight."

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:57.116
(Laughter)

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.356
This is what I sent Solomon.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.332
(Laughter)

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:11.268
(Applause)

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.884
I don't know if we have
any statisticians in the house,

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:16.917
but there's definitely something going on.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:18.575
(Laughter)

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.450
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email
you'll find a helpful chart.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.574
I've had one of my assistants
run the numbers.

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:27.384
(Laughter)

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.789
We're ready for shipping
as much gold as possible."

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:33.305
There's always a moment where they try
to tug your heartstrings,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.671
and this was it for Solomon.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.322
He said, "I will be so much happy
if the deal goes well,

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:40.021
because I'm going to get
a very good commission as well."

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:43.339
And I said, "That's amazing,
What are you going to spend your cut on?"

00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:45.513
And he said, "On RealEstate,
what about you?"

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:49.180
I thought about it for a long time.

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:52.564
And I said, "One word;

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:54.783
Hummus."

00:03:54.807 --> 00:03:57.988
(Laughter)

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.411
"It's going places.

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:02.618
(Laughter)

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:05.041
I was in Sainsbury's the other day

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:07.118
and there were like
30 different varieties.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.039
Also you can cut up carrots,
and you can dip them.

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:11.919
Have you ever done that, Solomon?"

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:13.943
(Laughter)

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.990
He said, "I have to go bed now."

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:18.893
(Laughter)

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.776
(Applause)

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.177
"Till morrow.

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:25.559
Have sweet dream."

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:26.971
I didn't know what to say!

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.530
I said, "Bonsoir
my golden nugget, bonsoir."

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.855
(Laughter)

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:36.475
Guys, you have to understand,
this had been going for, like, weeks,

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.650
albeit hitherto the greatest
weeks of my life,

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:40.301
but I had to knock it on the head.

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:41.905
It was getting a bit out of hand.

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:44.881
Friends were saying, "James,
do you want to come for a drink?"

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:47.921
I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting
an email about some gold."

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.989
So I figured I had
to knock it on the head.

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.069
I had to take it
to a ridiculous conclusion.

00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:53.245
So I concocted a plan.

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:55.621
I said, "Solomon,
I'm concerned about security.

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:56.852
When we email each other,

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:58.027
we need to use a code."

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:01.733
And he agreed.

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:03.145
(Laughter)

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.058
I said, "Solomon, I spent all night
coming up with this code

00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:08.187
we need to use
in all further correspondence:

00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:11.954
Lawyer: Gummy Bear.

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:15.423
Bank: Cream Egg.

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:18.169
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.
Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.113
Documents: Jelly Beans.

00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:22.281
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.137
(Laughter)

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:26.653
I knew these were all words
they use, right?

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:30.637
I said, "Please call me Kitkat
in all further correspondence."

00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:34.724
(Laughter)

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.430
I didn't hear back.
I thought, I've gone too far.

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.796
I've gone too far.
So I had to backpedal a little.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.105
I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.462
KitKat."

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:46.732
(Laughter)

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.628
Because you have to be consistent.

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:53.074
Then I did get an email back from him.

00:05:53.098 --> 00:05:56.278
He said, "The Business is on
and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."

00:05:56.302 --> 00:05:58.280
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.066
What followed is the greatest email
I've ever received.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.272
(Laughter)

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:10.221
I'm not joking, this is what
turned up in my inbox.

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.089
This was a good day.

00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:14.375
"The business is on.

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:18.684
I am trying to raise the balance
for the Gummy Bear --

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.107
(Laughter)

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:26.710
so he can submit all the needed
Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:27.887
to the Creme Egg,

00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:32.094
for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:33.497
(Laughter)

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.069
Send 1,500 pounds

00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:38.482
via a Giant Gummy Lizard."

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:45.275
(Applause)

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:51.797
And that was so much fun, right,

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.171
that it got me thinking:

00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:56.106
like, what would happen if I just spent
as much time as could

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.224
replying to as many
scam emails as I could?

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:03.121
And that's what I've been doing

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.245
for three years

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:06.550
on your behalf.

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:08.969
(Laughter)

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.312
(Applause)

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:14.950
Crazy stuff happens when you start
replying to scam emails.

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.125
It's really difficult,

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.727
and I highly recommend we do it.

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.592
I don't think what I'm doing is mean.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:22.368
There are a lot of people
who do mean things to scammers.

00:07:22.392 --> 00:07:25.979
All I'm doing is wasting their time.

00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:29.053
And I think any time
they're spending with me

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.674
is time they're not spending
scamming vulnerable adults

00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:33.071
out of their savings, right?

00:07:33.584 --> 00:07:37.147
And if you're going to do this --
and I highly recommend you do --

00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:39.182
get yourself a pseudonymous email address.

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:40.810
Don't use your own email address.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:43.688
That's what I was doing at the start
and it was a nightmare.

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:46.268
I'd wake up in the morning
and have a thousand emails

00:07:46.292 --> 00:07:47.499
about penis enlargements,

00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.720
only one of which
was a legitimate response --

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.840
(Laughter)

00:07:51.864 --> 00:07:53.206
to a medical question I had.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.999
But I'll tell you what, though, guys,

00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:58.024
I'll tell you what: any day is a good day,
any day is a good day

00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:00.469
if you receive an email
that begins like this:

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:04.372
(Laughter)

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:06.189
"I AM WINNIE MANDELA,

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:10.388
THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA
THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."

00:08:10.412 --> 00:08:12.315
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.420
(Laughter)

00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:14.594
I know so many.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:18.602
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS
OUT OF THE COUNTRY

00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:21.396
BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND
NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.579
Let that sink in.

00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:26.504
She sent me this, which is hysterical.

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:29.475
(Laughter)

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:30.658
And this.

00:08:30.682 --> 00:08:33.881
And this looks fairly legitimate,
this is a letter of authorization.

00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:37.294
But to be honest, if there's nothing
written on it, it's just a shape!

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.171
(Laughter)

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.993
I said, "Winnie,
I'm really sorry to hear of this.

00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:44.010
Given that Nelson died three months ago,

00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:46.620
I'd describe his health condition
as fairly serious."

00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:49.458
(Laughter)

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:53.001
That's the worst health condition
you can have, not being alive.

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:58.144
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY
WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.

00:08:58.168 --> 00:08:59.326
ONE LOVE."

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.302
(Laughter)

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:04.143
I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.671
(Laughter)

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:11.191
(Applause)
