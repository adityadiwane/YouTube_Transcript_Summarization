00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.776
Today I stand before you
as a man who lives life to the full

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.040
in the here and now.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.936
But for a long time,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.160
I lived for death.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.536
I was a young man who believed

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.120
that jihad is to be understood
in the language of force and violence.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.000
I tried to right wrongs
through power and aggression.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.880
I had deep concerns
for the suffering of others

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.000
and a strong desire
to help and bring relief to them.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.456
I thought violent jihad was noble,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.816
chivalrous

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.160
and the best way to help.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.536
At a time when so many of our people --

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.816
young people especially --

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.400
are at risk of radicalization

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.096
through groups like al-Qaeda,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.960
Islamic State and others,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.336
when these groups are claiming

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.416
that their horrific brutality
and violence are true jihad,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.616
I want to say that their idea
of jihad is wrong --

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.976
completely wrong --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.200
as was mine, then.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.560
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.456
It includes exertion and spirituality,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.976
self-purification

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
and devotion.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.256
It refers to positive transformation

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.376
through learning, wisdom
and remembrance of God.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.640
The word jihad stands
for all those meanings as a whole.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.336
Jihad may at times
take the form of fighting,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.560
but only sometimes,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.920
under strict conditions,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.160
within rules and limits.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.056
In Islam,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.080
the benefit of an act must outweigh
the harm or hardship it entails.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.976
More importantly,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.736
the verses in the Koran
that are connected to jihad or fighting

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.336
do not cancel out the verses
that talk about forgiveness,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.656
benevolence

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.880
or patience.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.896
But now I believe that there are
no circumstances on earth

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.496
where violent jihad is permissible,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.200
because it will lead to greater harm.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.296
But now the idea of jihad
has been hijacked.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.656
It has been perverted
to mean violent struggle

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.656
wherever Muslims
are undergoing difficulties,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.576
and turned into terrorism

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.656
by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.240
Islamic State and others.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.256
But I have come to understand

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.216
that true jihad
means striving to the utmost

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.600
to strengthen and live
those qualities which God loves:

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.776
honesty, trustworthiness,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.896
compassion, benevolence,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.816
reliability, respect,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.216
truthfulness --

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.360
human values that so many of us share.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.216
I was born in Bangladesh,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.669
but grew up mostly in England.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.719
And I went to school here.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.776
My father was an academic,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.880
and we were in the UK through his work.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.840
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh
when everything changed.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.776
The War of Independence
impacted upon us terribly,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.656
pitting family against family,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.376
neighbor against neighbor.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.256
And at the age of 12 I experienced war,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.880
destitution in my family,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.960
the deaths of 22
of my relatives in horrible ways,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.760
as well as the murder of my elder brother.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800
I witnessed killing ...

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.816
animals feeding on corpses in the streets,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.576
starvation all around me,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.736
wanton, horrific violence --

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960
senseless violence.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.016
I was a young man,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.976
teenager, fascinated by ideas.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.816
I wanted to learn,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.888
but I could not go to school
for four years.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.216
After the War of Independence,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.720
my father was put in prison
for two and a half years,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.360
and I used to visit him
every week in prison,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.600
and homeschooled myself.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.640
My father was released in 1973

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.096
and he fled to England as a refugee,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.360
and we soon followed him.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.376
I was 17.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.856
So these experiences gave me

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.680
a sharp awareness of the atrocities
and injustices in the world.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.136
And I had a strong desire --

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.176
a very keen, deep desire --

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.416
to right wrongs

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.107
and help the victims of oppression.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.536
While studying at college in the UK,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.040
I met others who showed me
how I could channel that desire

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.440
and help through my religion.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.016
And I was radicalized --

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.480
enough to consider violence correct,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.000
even a virtue under certain circumstances.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.536
So I became involved
in the jihad in Afghanistan.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.120
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan
population against the Soviet army.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.336
And I thought that was jihad:

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.856
my sacred duty,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.600
which would be rewarded by God.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880
I became a preacher.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.056
I was one of the pioneers
of violent jihad in the UK.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.576
I recruited,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.280
I raised funds, I trained.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.896
I confused true jihad

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.920
with this perversion
as presented by the fascist Islamists --

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.736
these people who use the idea of jihad

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.640
to justify their lust for power,
authority and control on earth:

00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:18.056
a perversion perpetuated today
by fascist Islamist groups

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.960
like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.280
For a period of around 15 years,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.280
I fought for short periods of time

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.976
in Kashmir and Burma,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.320
besides Afghanistan.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.720
Our aim was to remove the invaders,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.840
to bring relief to the oppressed victims

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.016
and of course to establish
an Islamic state,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.760
a caliphate for God's rule.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.920
And I did this openly.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.760
I didn't break any laws.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.536
I was proud and grateful to be British --

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.136
I still am.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.800
And I bore no hostility
against this, my country,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.496
nor enmity towards
the non-Muslim citizens,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.920
and I still don't.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.216
During one battle in Afghanistan,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.120
some British men and I
formed a special bond

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.696
with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.920
Abdullah,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.176
an innocent, loving and lovable kid

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.240
who was always eager to please.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.160
He was poor.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.480
And boys like him
did menial tasks in the camp.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.766
And he seemed happy enough,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.896
but I couldn't help wonder --

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.825
his parents must have missed him dearly.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.120
And they must have dreamt
about a better future for him.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.376
A victim of circumstance
caught up in a war,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.680
cruelly thrust upon him

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.960
by the cruel circumstances of the time.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.400
One day I picked up this unexploded
mortar shell in a trench,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.120
and I had it deposited
in a makeshift mud hut lab.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.216
And I went out on a short,
pointless skirmish --

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.440
always pointless,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.880
And I came back a few hours later
to discover he was dead.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.936
He had tried to recover
explosives from that shell.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.560
It exploded, and he died a violent death,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.720
blown to bits by the very same device
that had proved harmless to me.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.600
So I started to question.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.320
How did his death serve any purpose?

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.280
Why did he die and I lived?

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.056
I carried on.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.696
I fought in Kashmir.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.416
I also recruited for the Philippines,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.240
Bosnia and Chechnya.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.840
And the questions grew.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.776
Later in Burma,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.136
I came across Rohingya fighters,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.416
who were barely teenagers,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.096
born and brought up in the jungle,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.180
carrying machine guns
and grenade launchers.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.200
I met two 13-year-olds
with soft manners and gentle voices.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.136
Looking at me,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.240
they begged me
to take them away to England.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.600
They simply wanted to go to school --

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.000
that was their dream.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.576
My family --

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.056
my children of the same age --

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.040
were living at home in the UK,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.336
going to school,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.560
living a safe life.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.136
And I couldn't help wonder

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.616
how much these young boys
must have spoken to one another

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.840
about their dreams for such a life.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.840
Victims of circumstances:

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.640
these two young boys,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.376
sleeping rough on the ground,
looking up at the stars,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.896
cynically exploited by their leaders

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.400
for their personal lust
for glory and power.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.136
I soon witnessed boys like them
killing one another

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.400
in conflicts between rival groups.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.760
And it was the same everywhere ...

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.776
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.280
Philippines, Chechnya;

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.856
petty warlords got the young
and vulnerable to kill one another

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.200
in the name of jihad.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.080
Muslims against Muslims.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.016
Not protecting anyone
against invaders or occupiers;

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.040
not bringing relief to the oppressed.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.616
Children being used,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.256
cynically exploited;

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.216
people dying in conflicts

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.280
which I was supporting
in the name of jihad.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560
And it still carries on today.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.416
Realizing that the violent jihad

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.640
I had engaged in abroad

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.480
was so different --

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.016
such a chasm between
what I had experienced

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.840
and what I thought was sacred duty --

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.600
I had to reflect
on my activities here in the UK.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.296
I had to consider my preaching,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.856
recruiting, fund-raising,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.456
training,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.600
but most importantly, radicalizing --

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.856
sending young people to fight and die

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.096
as I was doing --

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.880
all totally wrong.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.880
So I got involved
in violent jihad in the mid '80s,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.440
starting with Afghanistan.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.880
And by the time I finished
it was in the year 2000.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.616
I was completely immersed in it.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.576
All around me people supported,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.816
applauded,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.240
even celebrated what
we were doing in their name.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.976
But by the time I learned to get out,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.616
completely disillusioned in the year 2000,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.320
15 years had passed.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.440
So what goes wrong?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.560
We were so busy talking about virtue,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.320
and we were blinded by a cause.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.520
And we did not give ourselves a chance
to develop a virtuous character.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.816
We told ourselves
we were fighting for the oppressed,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.040
but these were unwinnable wars.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.336
We became the very instrument
through which more deaths occurred,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.096
complicit in causing further misery

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.720
for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.496
So over time,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.720
a very long time,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.800
I opened my eyes.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.440
I began to dare

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.696
to face the truth,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.920
to think,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.496
to face the hard questions.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.720
I got in touch with my soul.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.400
What have I learned?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.200
That people who engage
in violent jihadism,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.560
that people who are drawn
to these types of extremisms,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.800
are not that different to everyone else.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.680
But I believe such people can change.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.976
They can regain their hearts
and restore them

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.060
by filling them
with human values that heal.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.216
When we ignore the realities,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.000
we discover that we accept what
we are told without critical reflection.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.416
And we ignore the gifts and advantages
that many of us would cherish

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.720
even for a single moment in their lives.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.760
I engaged in actions
I thought were correct.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.760
But now I began to question
how I knew what I knew.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.536
I endlessly told others
to accept the truth,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.280
but I failed to give doubt
its rightful place.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.776
This conviction that people can change
is rooted in my experience,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.000
my own journey.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.416
Through wide reading,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.640
reflecting,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.056
contemplation, self-knowledge,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.296
I discovered,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.960
I realized that Islamists' world
of us and them is false and unjust.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.480
Through considering the uncertainties
in all that we had asserted,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.016
to the inviolable truths,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.440
incontestable truths,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.840
I developed a more nuanced understanding.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.960
I realized that in a world crowded
with variation and contradiction,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.136
foolish preachers,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.176
only foolish preachers
like I used to be,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.560
see no paradox in the myths and fictions
they use to assert authenticity.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.656
So I understood the vital
importance of self-knowledge,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.880
political awareness

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.656
and the necessity
for a deep and wide understanding

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.136
of our commitments and our actions,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.480
how they affect others.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.976
So my plea today to everyone,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.480
especially those who sincerely
believe in Islamist jihadism ...

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.880
refuse dogmatic authority;

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.040
let go of anger, hatred and violence;

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.776
learn to right wrongs

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.870
without even attempting to justify
cruel, unjust and futile behavior.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.176
Instead create a few
beautiful and useful things

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.400
that outlive us.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.056
Approach the world, life,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.280
with love.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.216
Learn to develop

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.496
or cultivate your hearts

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.880
to see goodness, beauty and truth
in others and in the world.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.520
That way we do matter
more to ourselves ...

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.440
to each other,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.376
to our communities

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.880
and, for me, to God.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.616
This is jihad --

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.840
my true jihad.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.136
Thank you.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.600
(Applause)
