00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.665
What if I could present you a story

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.103
that you would remember
with your entire body

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:19.284
and not just with your mind?

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:21.983
My whole life as a journalist,
I've really been compelled

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.318
to try to make stories
that can make a difference

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:26.912
and maybe inspire people to care.

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:29.262
I've worked in print.
I've worked in documentary.

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:30.555
I've worked in broadcast.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.641
But it really wasn't until
I got involved with virtual reality

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.506
that I started seeing
these really intense,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.514
authentic reactions from people

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.213
that really blew my mind.

00:00:40.237 --> 00:00:44.910
So the deal is that with VR,
virtual reality,

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:47.934
I can put you on scene

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.759
in the middle of the story.

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:53.632
By putting on these goggles
that track wherever you look,

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.584
you get this whole-body sensation,

00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:58.815
like you're actually, like, there.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.611
So five years ago was about when
I really began to push the envelope

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.885
with using virtual reality
and journalism together.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.457
And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.640
Families in America are going hungry,
food banks are overwhelmed,

00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:13.719
and they're often running out of food.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.949
Now, I knew I couldn't
make people feel hungry,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.790
but maybe I could figure out a way
to get them to feel something physical.

00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:25.790
So -- again, this is five years ago --

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.990
so doing journalism
and virtual reality together

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:31.997
was considered
a worse-than-half-baked idea,

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:33.376
and I had no funding.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.899
Believe me, I had a lot
of colleagues laughing at me.

00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:39.713
And I did, though,
have a really great intern,

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:41.975
a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.817
And together we went out to food banks

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:46.913
and started recording
audio and photographs.

00:01:46.937 --> 00:01:48.857
Until one day she came back to my office

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.276
and she was bawling, she was just crying.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.902
She had been on scene at a long line,

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:57.871
where the woman running the line
was feeling extremely overwhelmed,

00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:00.863
and she was screaming,
"There's too many people!

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.783
There's too many people!"

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:06.362
And this man with diabetes
doesn't get food in time,

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:09.941
his blood sugar drops too low,
and he collapses into a coma.

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:12.227
As soon as I heard that audio,

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:15.496
I knew that this would be
the kind of evocative piece

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.624
that could really describe
what was going on at food banks.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.906
So here's the real line.
You can see how long it was, right?

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.557
And again, as I said, we didn't
have very much funding,

00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:29.331
so I had to reproduce it
with virtual humans that were donated,

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:33.481
and people begged and borrowed favors
to help me create the models

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.664
and make things as accurate as we could.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.297
And then we tried to convey
what happened that day

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:41.115
with as much as accuracy as is possible.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.878
(Video) Voice: There's too many people!
There's too many people!

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.061
Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.872
Voice: We need an ambulance.

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:16.198
Nonny de la PeÃ±a: So the man on the right,

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:18.094
for him, he's walking around the body.

00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.815
For him, he's in the room with that body.

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:23.172
Like, that guy is at his feet.

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:25.808
And even though,
through his peripheral vision,

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:27.903
he can see that he's in this lab space,

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:32.140
he should be able to see
that he's not actually on the street,

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:35.060
but he feels like he's there
with those people.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:37.094
He's very cautious not to step on this guy

00:03:37.118 --> 00:03:38.784
who isn't really there, right?

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.609
So that piece ended up
going to Sundance in 2012,

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:46.554
a kind of amazing thing,
and it was the first virtual reality film

00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:48.538
ever, basically.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.023
And when we went, I was really terrified.

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.484
I didn't really know
how people were going to react

00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:54.897
and what was going to happen.

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.818
And we showed up
with this duct-taped pair of goggles.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:01.827
(Video) Oh, you're crying.
You're crying. Gina, you're crying.

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:04.571
So you can hear
the surprise in my voice, right?

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:08.190
And this kind of reaction ended up being
the kind of reaction we saw

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.984
over and over and over:

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:14.714
people down on the ground
trying to comfort the seizure victim,

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:16.658
trying to whisper something into his ear

00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:20.640
or in some way help,
even though they couldn't.

00:04:20.664 --> 00:04:23.348
And I had a lot of people
come out of that piece saying,

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:26.096
"Oh my God, I was so frustrated.
I couldn't help the guy,"

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.841
and take that back into their lives.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.865
So after this piece was made,

00:04:32.198 --> 00:04:36.007
the dean of the cinema school at USC,
the University of Southern California,

00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:40.238
brought in the head of the World
Economic Forum to try "Hunger,"

00:04:40.262 --> 00:04:41.603
and he took off the goggles,

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.667
and he commissioned
a piece about Syria on the spot.

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.604
And I really wanted to do something
about Syrian refugee kids,

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:51.920
because children have been the worst
affected by the Syrian civil war.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.767
I sent a team to the border of Iraq
to record material at refugee camps,

00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.942
basically an area I wouldn't
send a team now,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.434
as that's where ISIS is really operating.

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:05.164
And then we also recreated a street scene

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:08.711
in which a young girl is singing
and a bomb goes off.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.419
Now, when you're
in the middle of that scene

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.997
and you hear those sounds,

00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.314
and you see the injured around you,

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:19.338
it's an incredibly scary and real feeling.

00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:23.902
I've had individuals who have been
involved in real bombings tell me

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:27.401
that it evokes the same kind of fear.

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.730
[The civil war in Syria may seem far away]

00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:40.344
[until you experience it yourself.]

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:48.013
(Girl singing)

00:05:48.037 --> 00:05:50.815
(Explosion)

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.076
[Project Syria]

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.985
[A virtual reality experience]

00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:00.721
NP: We were then invited to take the piece

00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:02.799
to the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London.

00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:04.180
And it wasn't advertised.

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:06.528
And we were put in this tapestry room.

00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:07.894
There was no press about it,

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:11.655
so anybody who happened to walk
into the museum to visit it that day

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.442
would see us with these crazy lights.

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:17.141
You know, maybe they would want to see
the old storytelling of the tapestries.

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:19.632
They were confronted
by our virtual reality cameras.

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.640
But a lot of people tried it,
and over a five-day run

00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:28.204
we ended up with 54 pages
of guest book comments,

00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.564
and we were told by the curators there

00:06:30.588 --> 00:06:33.177
that they'd never seen such an outpouring.

00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:37.828
Things like, "It's so real,"
"Absolutely believable,"

00:06:37.852 --> 00:06:40.312
or, of course, the one
that I was excited about,

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:43.185
"A real feeling as if you were
in the middle of something

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.471
that you normally see on the TV news."

00:06:46.463 --> 00:06:49.939
So, it works, right? This stuff works.

00:06:50.297 --> 00:06:54.092
And it doesn't really matter
where you're from or what age you are --

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:56.319
it's really evocative.

00:06:56.343 --> 00:07:00.295
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying
that when you're in a piece

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.199
you forget that you're here.

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.398
But it turns out we can feel
like we're in two places at once.

00:07:06.422 --> 00:07:09.572
We can have what I call
this duality of presence,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:14.453
and I think that's what allows me
to tap into these feelings of empathy.

00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:15.628
Right?

00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.232
So that means, of course,

00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:24.151
that I have to be very cautious
about creating these pieces.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:28.437
I have to really follow
best journalistic practices

00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:30.596
and make sure that these powerful stories

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.206
are built with integrity.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.603
If we don't capture
the material ourselves,

00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:39.595
we have to be extremely exacting

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.920
about figuring out the provenance
and where did this stuff come from

00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:44.252
and is it authentic?

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:45.633
Let me give you an example.

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:48.594
With this Trayvon Martin case,
this is a guy, a kid,

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:52.721
who was 17 years old and he bought
soda and a candy at a store,

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:56.221
and on his way home he was tracked
by a neighborhood watchman

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:59.110
named George Zimmerman
who ended up shooting and killing him.

00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:00.809
To make that piece,

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:04.435
we got the architectural drawings
of the entire complex,

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:09.228
and we rebuilt the entire scene
inside and out, based on those drawings.

00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:10.547
All of the action

00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:15.490
is informed by the real 911
recorded calls to the police.

00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:19.188
And interestingly, we broke
some news with this story.

00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:23.187
The forensic house that did the audio
reconstruction, Primeau Productions,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.157
they say that they would testify

00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:27.856
that George Zimmerman,
when he got out of the car,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.712
he cocked his gun before he went
to give chase to Martin.

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:35.418
So you can see that
the basic tenets of journalism,

00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:37.315
they don't really change here, right?

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:40.743
We're still following the same principles
that we would always.

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:44.070
What is different is the sense
of being on scene,

00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:46.435
whether you're watching
a guy collapse from hunger

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.944
or feeling like you're
in the middle of a bomb scene.

00:08:48.968 --> 00:08:53.916
And this is kind of what has driven me
forward with these pieces,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.663
and thinking about how to make them.

00:08:55.687 --> 00:08:59.882
We're trying to make this, obviously,
beyond the headset, more available.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.833
We're creating mobile pieces
like the Trayvon Martin piece.

00:09:02.857 --> 00:09:06.406
And these things have had impact.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.002
I've had Americans tell me
that they've donated,

00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:13.420
direct deductions from their bank account,
money to go to Syrian children refugees.

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:15.777
And "Hunger in LA," well,
it's helped start

00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:18.230
a new form of doing journalism

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:21.350
that I think is going to join
all the other normal platforms

00:09:21.374 --> 00:09:22.525
in the future.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:23.713
Thank you.

00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:26.149
(Applause)
