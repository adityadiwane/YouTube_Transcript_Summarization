00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.756
This is where I live. I live in Kenya,

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.823
at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:20.811
Those are my dad's cows at the back,

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:22.791
and behind the cows,

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.095
that's the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.600
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.062
which means wild animals like zebras

00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:35.983
migrate out of the park freely.

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.996
So predators like lions follow them,

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:42.791
and this is what they do.

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:45.792
They kill our livestock.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.239
This is one of the cows which was killed at night,

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.279
and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:54.705
and I felt so bad,

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:59.192
because it was the only bull we had.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.979
My community, the Maasai, we believe that

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.036
we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:11.811
for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.570
So I grew up hating lions so much.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.623
The morans are the warriors

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:21.940
who protect our community and the livestock,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.019
and they're also upset about this problem.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:28.024
So they kill the lions.

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:31.938
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:36.477
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:41.438
So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:44.312
is responsible for his dad's cows,

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.442
and that's the same thing which happened to me.

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:50.857
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:55.671
And the first idea I got was to use fire,

00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.464
because I thought lions were scared of fire.

00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:04.183
But I came to realize that that didn't really help,

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:06.792
because it was even helping the lions

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:10.303
to see through the cowshed.

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:13.632
So I didn't give up. I continued.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:16.272
And a second idea I got was

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:18.339
to use a scarecrow.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.953
I was trying to trick the lions

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:22.860
[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.936
But lions are very clever. (Laughter)

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:31.382
They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:34.656
but the second day, they'll come and they say,

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:37.766
this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:41.003
So he jumps in and kills the animals.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.956
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:48.799
and that day, the lions didn't come.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.357
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:55.930
So I had an idea.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.240
Since I was a small boy,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.498
I used to work in my room for the whole day,

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:04.604
and I even took apart my mom's new radio,

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:06.422
and that day she almost killed me,

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:12.676
but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:16.036
So I got an old car battery,

00:03:16.036 --> 00:03:19.826
an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:24.877
and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:29.431
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.

00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:34.259
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.140
So I set up everything.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.364
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,

00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:42.485
and the battery supplies the power

00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:45.540
to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.261
And the indicator box makes the lights flash.

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.012
As you can see, the bulbs face outside,

00:03:54.012 --> 00:03:56.500
because that's where the lions come from.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.564
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.

00:04:00.564 --> 00:04:03.292
The lights flash and trick

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:05.234
the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:07.160
but I was sleeping in my bed.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.900
(Laughter)

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.569
(Applause)

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.164
Thanks.

00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:21.440
So I set it up in my home two years ago,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.760
and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.772
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.

00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:31.236
One of them was this grandmother.

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:35.512
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:37.646
and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:38.924
And I said, "Yes."

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:43.524
So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.

00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:46.940
Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.165
and they're really working.

00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:54.345
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:59.458
for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:01.693
and it's also being used

00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:05.738
to scare elephants away from people's farms.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.778
Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship

00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:11.428
in one of the best schools in Kenya,

00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.335
Brookhouse International School,

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:16.262
and I'm really excited about this.

00:05:16.262 --> 00:05:20.112
My new school now is coming in and helping

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:24.644
by fundraising and creating an awareness.

00:05:24.644 --> 00:05:29.927
I even took my friends back to my community,

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:33.124
and we're installing the lights to the homes

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:37.773
which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:41.670
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.344
herding my father's cows,

00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:46.298
and I used to see planes flying over,

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:50.509
and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.597
And here I am today.

00:05:53.597 --> 00:05:59.533
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.

00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:04.969
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.663
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:11.981
is saving my father's cows and the lions,

00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:15.681
we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.901
Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.

00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:29.801
(Applause)

00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.682
Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:37.793
to hear a story like yours.

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:39.829
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.406
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:44.264
What's the next one on your list?

00:06:44.264 --> 00:06:46.938
RT: My next invention is,

00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:49.520
I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.681
RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,

00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.918
but I want to make mine.

00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:56.009
(Laughter)

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.179
CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:05.936
but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:09.262
CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.230
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.787
Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)
