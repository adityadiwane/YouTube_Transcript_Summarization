00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:17.530
I'm going to talk to you today

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:21.037
about the design of medical technology
for low-resource settings.

00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.414
I study health systems in these countries.

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:25.353
And one of the major gaps in care,

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:27.036
almost across the board,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.227
is access to safe surgery.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.910
Now one of the major
bottlenecks that we've found

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.169
that's sort of preventing
both the access in the first place,

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:38.629
and the safety of those surgeries
that do happen, is anesthesia.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.498
And actually, it's the model
that we expect to work

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:44.221
for delivering anesthesia
in these environments.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.733
Here, we have a scene that you would find
in any operating room across the US,

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.234
or any other developed country.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.445
In the background there

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.040
is a very sophisticated
anesthesia machine.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:57.913
And this machine is able
to enable surgery and save lives

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:01.236
because it was designed
with this environment in mind.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.521
In order to operate,
this machine needs a number of things

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.445
that this hospital has to offer.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.837
It needs an extremely
well-trained anesthesiologist

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.312
with years of training
with complex machines

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.757
to help her monitor the flows of the gas

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.344
and keep her patients
safe and anesthetized

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.819
throughout the surgery.

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:21.610
It's a delicate machine
running on computer algorithms,

00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:24.852
and it needs special care, TLC,
to keep it up and running,

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.734
and it's going to break pretty easily.

00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:29.670
And when it does, it needs
a team of biomedical engineers

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:33.003
who understand its complexities,
can fix it, can source the parts

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.259
and keep it saving lives.

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:37.482
It's a pretty expensive machine.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.147
It needs a hospital
whose budget can allow it

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:45.065
to support one machine
costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:47.455
And perhaps most obviously,

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.993
but also most importantly --

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:51.853
and the path to concepts
that we've heard about

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.163
kind of illustrates this --

00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:58.333
it needs infrastructure that can supply
an uninterrupted source of electricity,

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.369
of compressed oxygen,
and other medical supplies

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:05.671
that are so critical
to the functioning of this machine.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.994
In other words, this machine
requires a lot of stuff

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:10.991
that this hospital cannot offer.

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:14.612
This is the electrical supply
for a hospital in rural Malawi.

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:16.574
In this hospital,

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:19.269
there is one person qualified
to deliver anesthesia,

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:20.445
and she's qualified

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.045
because she has 12, maybe 18 months
of training in anesthesia.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.316
In the hospital and in the entire region

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.347
there's not a single biomedical engineer.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.940
So when this machine breaks,

00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:33.173
the machines that they have
to work with break,

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:34.966
they've got to try and figure it out,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.282
but most of the time,
that's the end of the road.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:39.523
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.876
And the price tag
of the machine that I mentioned

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.961
could represent maybe a quarter or a third

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:46.797
of the annual operating budget
for this hospital.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.224
And finally, I think you can see
that infrastructure is not very strong.

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:53.922
This hospital is connected
to a very weak power grid,

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.728
one that goes down frequently.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:58.298
So it runs frequently,
the entire hospital,

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.745
just on a generator.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.925
And you can imagine,
the generator breaks down

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.261
or runs out of fuel.

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:05.648
And the World Bank sees this

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:09.203
and estimates that a hospital
in this setting in a low-income country

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:12.303
can expect up to
18 power outages per month.

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:17.111
Similarly, compressed oxygen
and other medical supplies

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:18.317
are really a luxury,

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.623
and can often be out of stock
for months or even a year.

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:24.811
So it seems crazy, but the model
that we have right now

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:27.040
is taking those machines
that were designed

00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:29.347
for that first environment
that I showed you

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:33.235
and donating or selling them
to hospitals in this environment.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.697
It's not just inappropriate,

00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:38.259
it becomes really unsafe.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:40.698
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins

00:03:40.722 --> 00:03:44.901
was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone
about a year ago.

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:48.818
And the first surgery of the day
happened to be an obstetrical case.

00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:51.825
A woman came in,
she needed an emergency C-section

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.578
to save her life and the life of her baby.

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.019
And everything began pretty auspiciously.

00:03:57.043 --> 00:03:59.296
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.608
The nurse was there.

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:03.493
She was able to anesthetize her quickly,
and it was important

00:04:03.517 --> 00:04:05.853
because of the emergency
nature of the situation.

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:07.594
And everything began well

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:09.690
until the power went out.

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:12.857
And now in the middle of this surgery,

00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:15.950
the surgeon is racing
against the clock to finish his case,

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:18.326
which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.411
But the nurse is literally running
around a darkened operating theater

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:25.390
trying to find anything
she can use to anesthetize her patient,

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:27.103
to keep her patient asleep.

00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:30.010
Because her machine doesn't work
when there's no power.

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:33.751
This routine surgery that many of you
have probably experienced,

00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:38.249
and others are probably the product of,
has now become a tragedy.

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.651
And what's so frustrating
is this is not a singular event;

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:44.174
this happens across the developing world.

00:04:44.198 --> 00:04:47.151
35 million surgeries
are attempted every year

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:48.771
without safe anesthesia.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.382
My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton,
was living this reality.

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:54.236
He was the chief of anesthesiology

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.760
in a hospital in Malawi,
a teaching hospital.

00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:58.782
He went to work every day

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:00.774
in an operating theater like this one,

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:03.937
trying to deliver anesthesia
and teach others how to do so

00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:05.236
using that same equipment

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.571
that became so unreliable,
and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:12.079
And after umpteen surgeries

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.671
and, you can imagine,
really unspeakable tragedy,

00:05:14.695 --> 00:05:17.037
he just said, "That's it.
I'm done. That's enough.

00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:19.131
There has to be something better."

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.036
He took a walk down the hall

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.491
to where they threw all those machines
that had just crapped out on them,

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.192
I think that's the scientific term,

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:27.558
and he started tinkering.

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:29.935
He took one part from here
and another from there,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.541
and he tried to come up
with a machine that would work

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.193
in the reality that he was facing.

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:35.431
And what he came up with:

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:36.778
was this guy.

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:40.339
The prototype for the Universal
Anesthesia Machine --

00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:43.660
a machine that would work
and anesthetize his patients

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:47.259
no matter the circumstances
that his hospital had to offer.

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.260
Here it is, back at home

00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:52.713
at that same hospital, developed
a little further, 12 years later,

00:05:52.737 --> 00:05:55.917
working on patients
from pediatrics to geriatrics.

00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:59.167
Let me show you a little bit
about how this machine works.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.069
Voila!

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:02.919
Here she is.

00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:04.187
When you have electricity,

00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:07.229
everything in this machine
begins in the base.

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:09.850
There's a built-in
oxygen concentrator down there.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:13.003
Now you've heard me mention
oxygen a few times at this point.

00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:16.815
Essentially, to deliver anesthesia,
you want as pure oxygen as possible,

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.262
because eventually you're going
to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:22.722
And the mixture that the patient inhales

00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:25.057
needs to be at least
a certain percentage oxygen

00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:26.767
or else it can become dangerous.

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.709
But so in here when there's electricity,

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:31.608
the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.

00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:34.911
Now we know room air is gloriously free,

00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:36.236
it is abundant,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.259
and it's already 21 percent oxygen.

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:42.373
So all this concentrator does
is take that room air in, filter it

00:06:42.397 --> 00:06:46.217
and send 95 percent pure oxygen
up and across here,

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:48.447
where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.

00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:52.627
Now before that mixture
hits the patient's lungs,

00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:54.865
it's going to pass by here --
you can't see it,

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.671
but there's an oxygen sensor here --

00:06:56.695 --> 00:07:00.900
that's going to read out on this screen
the percentage of oxygen being delivered.

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:03.518
Now if you don't have power,

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:07.148
or, God forbid, the power cuts out
in the middle of a surgery,

00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:09.516
this machine transitions automatically,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.289
without even having to touch it,

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:13.644
to drawing in room air from this inlet.

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:15.401
Everything else is the same.

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:17.021
The only difference is that now

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:20.259
you're only working
with 21 percent oxygen.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:23.487
Now that used to be
a dangerous guessing game,

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:25.897
because you only knew
if you gave too little oxygen

00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:27.297
once something bad happened.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.034
But we've put a long-life
battery backup on here.

00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:32.252
This is the only part
that's battery backed up.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:35.681
But this gives control to the provider,
whether there's power or not,

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.298
because they can adjust the flows

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:41.290
based on the percentage of oxygen
they see that they're giving the patient.

00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:44.659
In both cases,
whether you have power or not,

00:07:44.683 --> 00:07:46.723
sometimes the patient
needs help breathing.

00:07:46.747 --> 00:07:49.948
It's just a reality of anesthesia,
the lungs can be paralyzed.

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:52.056
And so we've just added
this manual bellows.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.071
We've seen surgeries
for three or four hours

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:56.953
to ventilate the patient on this.

00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:00.672
So it's a straightforward machine.

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:03.601
I shudder to say simple;
it's straightforward.

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:06.097
And it's by design.

00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:11.321
You do not need to be a highly trained,
specialized anesthesiologist

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:12.516
to use this machine,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.292
which is good because,
in these rural district hospitals,

00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:17.911
you're not going to get
that level of training.

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:21.063
It's also designed for the environment
that it will be used in.

00:08:21.087 --> 00:08:22.864
This is an incredibly rugged machine.

00:08:22.888 --> 00:08:26.343
It has to stand up to the heat
and the wear and tear

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.485
that happens in hospitals
in these rural districts.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.904
And so it's not going
to break very easily,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.202
but if it does, virtually
every piece in this machine

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:37.236
can be swapped out and replaced

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.254
with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.270
And finally, it's affordable.

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:46.947
This machine comes in
at an eighth of the cost

00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:50.049
of the conventional machine
that I showed you earlier.

00:08:50.073 --> 00:08:54.561
So in other words, what we have here
is a machine that can enable surgery

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:55.757
and save lives,

00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:58.771
because it was designed
for its environment,

00:08:58.795 --> 00:09:01.213
just like the first machine I showed you.

00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:03.241
But we're not content to stop there.

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:04.440
Is it working?

00:09:04.464 --> 00:09:07.046
Is this the design
that's going to work in place?

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.837
Well, we've seen good results so far.

00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:12.246
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.203
and since 2010, we've done
well over 2,000 surgeries

00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:18.460
with no clinically adverse events.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.967
So we're thrilled.

00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:24.413
This really seems like
a cost-effective, scalable solution

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:26.470
to a problem that's really pervasive.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.558
But we still want to be sure

00:09:28.582 --> 00:09:30.999
that this is the most effective
and safe device

00:09:31.023 --> 00:09:33.080
that we can be putting into hospitals.

00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:35.628
So to do that, we've launched
a number of partnerships

00:09:35.652 --> 00:09:37.138
with NGOs and universities,

00:09:37.162 --> 00:09:39.811
to gather data on the user interface,

00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:42.027
on the types of surgeries
it's appropriate for,

00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:44.438
and ways we can enhance the device itself.

00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:47.116
One of those partnerships
is with Johns Hopkins

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.513
just here in Baltimore.

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:52.815
They have a really cool anesthesia
simulation lab out in Baltimore.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:54.720
So we're taking this machine

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:58.318
and recreating some
of the operating theater crises

00:09:58.342 --> 00:09:59.849
that this machine might face

00:09:59.873 --> 00:10:02.236
in one of the hospitals
that it's intended for,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.384
and in a contained, safe environment,

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:06.125
evaluating its effectiveness.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:10.239
We're then able to compare
the results from that study

00:10:10.263 --> 00:10:11.683
with real-world experience,

00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:13.904
because we're putting
two of these in hospitals

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:16.079
that Johns Hopkins
works with in Sierra Leone,

00:10:16.103 --> 00:10:19.217
including the hospital
where that emergency C-section happened.

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:23.773
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia,
and I tend to do that.

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:27.889
I think it is incredibly fascinating
and an important component of health.

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:30.544
And it really seems peripheral,
we never think about it,

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:32.772
until we don't have access to it,

00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:34.758
and then it becomes a gatekeeper.

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:36.751
Who gets surgery and who doesn't?

00:10:37.084 --> 00:10:39.814
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.939
But you know,
it's just one of so many ways

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:46.070
that design, appropriate design,

00:10:46.094 --> 00:10:48.070
can have an impact on health outcomes.

00:10:48.578 --> 00:10:50.697
If more people
in the health-delivery space

00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:54.290
really working on some of these
challenges in low-income countries

00:10:54.314 --> 00:10:57.967
could start their design process,
their solution search,

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.929
from outside of that proverbial box

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:01.891
and inside of the hospital --

00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:03.746
In other words, if we could design

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.961
for the environment that exists
in so many parts of the world,

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:09.394
rather than the one
that we wished existed --

00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:11.584
we might just save a lot of lives.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.515
Thank you very much.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:17.974
