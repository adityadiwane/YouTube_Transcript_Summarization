00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
(Music)

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
♫ My age is three hundred ♫

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
♫ and seventy-two ♫

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
♫ How I used to pick up

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and voraciously chew ♫

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
♫ the dear little boys

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that I met ♫

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
♫ I've eaten them raw

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in their holiday suits, ♫

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
♫ Eaten them

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
curried with rice, ♫

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
♫ I've eaten them baked

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in their jackets and boots, ♫

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
♫ But now that my jaws

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
are too weak for such fare, ♫

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
♫ To do such a thing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
when I'm quite well aware ♫

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
♫ Little boys do not like

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
being chewed. ♫

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
♫ Little boys do not like

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
being chewed. ♫

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
(Music)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
♫ So now I contentedly live upon eels, ♫

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
♫ And try to do nothing amiss ♫

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
♫ And pass all the time

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I can spare from my meals ♫

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
♫ In innocent slumber like this, ♫

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
♫ Innocent slumber

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
like this. ♫

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:53.260
(Applause)

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I've been working on a project for the last six years

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
adapting children's poetry to music.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
who was a stockbroker in New York City

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
for 45 years,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And this book was one of the most famous books in America

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
for about 35 years.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
is one of his poems.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Now, we're going to do

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
other poems for you,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and here's a preview of some of the poets.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
This is Rachel Field,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Robert Graves --

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
a very young Robert Graves --

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Christina Rossetti.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Ghosts, right?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Have nothing to say to us,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
obsolete,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
gone --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
not so.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
What I really enjoyed about this project

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
is reviving these people's words.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Taking them off the dead, flat pages.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Bringing them to life,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
bringing them to light.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
So, what we're going to do next

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
When she was 10 years old in 1927,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
she published her first book of poems

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
called "The Janitor's Boy."

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Here she is.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And here's her poem.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
(Music)

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
♫ And the janitor's boy

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
is in love with me. ♫

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
♫ And the janitor's boy

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
is in love with me. ♫

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
♫ In our geography. ♫

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
♫ A desert isle

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
with spicy trees ♫

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
♫ A right nice place,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
just fit for two ♫

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
♫ Where we can live always. ♫

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
he's busy as can be; ♫

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
♫ Out of an old settee. ♫

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
♫ He'll carry me off,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I know that he will, ♫

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
♫ And the only thing

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
that occurs to me ♫

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
♫ And on the day that we sail,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I will leave a little note ♫

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
♫ "I have flown to an island

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
in the bay ♫

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
♫ With my janitor's

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
red haired-boy." ♫

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
♫ I'm going to sail away ♫

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
♫ Gone to Sheepshead Bay ♫

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
♫ With my janitor's red-haired boy. ♫

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
♫ On an old settee ♫

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
♫ My red-haired boy and me ♫

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy. ♫

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:37.260
(Applause)

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
The next poem is by E.E. Cummings,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
"Maggie and Milly and Molly and May."

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
(Music)

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Molly and May ♫

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
♫ They went down to the beach

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
one day to play ♫

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
♫ And Maggie discovered

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
a shell that sang ♫

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
♫ So sweetly she couldn't remember

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
her troubles ♫

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Molly and May ♫

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Molly and May ♫

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
♫ Milly befriended

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
a stranded star ♫

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
♫ Whose rays,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
whose rays ♫

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
♫ Five languid fingers

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
were ♫

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.260
(Music)

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Molly and May ♫

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Molly and May ♫

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
(Music)

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
♫ Molly was chased

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
by a horrible thing ♫

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
♫ Which raced

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
sideways blowing ♫

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
♫ Blowing ♫

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
♫ Blowing ♫

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
♫ May came home

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
with a smooth, round stone ♫

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
♫ Small as a world

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and as large as alone ♫

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.260
(Music)

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
♫ For whatever we lose

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
like a you or a me ♫

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
♫ Always ourselves

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that we find

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
at the sea ♫

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
(Applause)

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Thank you.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:33.260
(Applause)

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
who had made his fame in England.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
He went there after the death

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
of his wife of smallpox

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and brought his two young children.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
One was his daughter, Laurence.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
She wrote this poem when she was

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
18 years old in 1888,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and I look at it as kind of a

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
very sweet feminist manifesto

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
tinged with a little bit of defiance

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and a little bit of resignation and regret.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:25.260
(Music)

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.260
♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
♫ And you know I'm seldom good,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
seldom good -- ♫

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.260
♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
♫ And a pony all my own ♫

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
♫ That I can take to town. ♫

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
♫ And when I'm really getting old -- ♫

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
♫ Marries me ♫

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
♫ Marries me ♫

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Thank you.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:52.260
(Applause) Thank you.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
I became very curious about the poets

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
after spending six years with them,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
and started to research their lives,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and then decided to write a book about it.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
was: Did she marry?

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And the answer was no,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
which I found in the London Times archive.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
She died alone in 1940

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
in the company of her books and her dear friends.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
Gerard Manley Hopkins,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
a saintly man.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
He became a Jesuit.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
He converted from his Anglican faith.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as --

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and he became a Jesuit priest.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
He burned all his poetry at the age of 24

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and then did not write another poem for at least seven years

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
with the life of a priest.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
He died typhoid fever

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
at the age of 44, I believe,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
43 or 44.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
At the time, he was teaching classics

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
at Trinity College in Dublin.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
A few years before he died,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
after he had resumed writing poetry,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
but in secret,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
he confessed to a friend in a letter

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
that I found when I was doing my research:

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
"I've written a verse.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
It is to explain death to a child,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
And my blood froze when I read that

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
because I had written the plain-song music

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
130 years after he'd written the letter.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
♫ Margaret,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
are you grieving ♫

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
♫ It's the blight

Calming the audience down;
