00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.236
So, a funny thing happened

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.736
on my way to becoming a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist:

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.511
I had a baby.

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:26.520
And that's not to say

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:30.482
I ever went on to become a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist.

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:31.981
Sorry, TED.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:36.634
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:38.536
arguably world-class worrier.

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.336
One of my girlfriends
in graduate school, Marie,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.105
said, "Kim, I figured it out.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.936
It's not that you're more neurotic
than everyone else;

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.457
it's just that you're more honest
about how neurotic you are."

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.495
So in the spirit of full disclosure,

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.104
I brought some pictures to share.

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:58.360
Awwww.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:00:59.385
(Laughter)

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.656
I'll just say: July.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.470
(Laughter)

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.375
Zip!

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.400
(Laughter)

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:10.725
For safety.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.412
(Laughter)

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:14.328
Water wings --

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.578
an inch of water.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.723
And then, finally, all suited up

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:22.095
for the 90-minute drive
to Copper Mountain.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.080
So you can get kind of a feel for this.

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:29.959
So my baby, Vander,
is eight years old now.

00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:34.600
And, despite being cursed
with my athletic inability,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.197
he plays soccer.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.198
He's interested in playing football.

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:40.483
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:42.706
So why would I worry?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.707
Because this is what I do.
This is what I teach.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:47.803
It's what I study. It's what I treat.

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:50.827
And I know that kids
get concussed every year.

00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:55.341
In fact, more than four million people
sustain a concussion every year,

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.936
and these data are just
among kids under 14

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.222
who were seen in emergency rooms.

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:02.936
And so when kids sustain a concussion,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.936
we talk about them getting dinged
or getting their bell rung,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.636
but what is it that
we're really talking about?

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.246
Let's take a look.

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:13.239
[Concussive Force]

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:17.858
"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:19.142
So, a car accident.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.444
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:

00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:22.782
35 Gs.

00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:29.653
A heavyweight boxer punches
you straight in the face:

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:31.131
58 Gs.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:37.703
(Music)

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:40.123
In case you missed it, we'll look again.

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:42.335
So look to the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:48.633
(Music)

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:50.066
What would you say?

00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:52.243
How many Gs?

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.623
Close.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.472
Seventy-two?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.162
Would it be crazy to know:

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:02.480
103 Gs?

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:04.630
The average concussive impact

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.620
is 95 Gs.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.303
Now, when the kid
on the right doesn't get up,

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:12.936
we know they've had a concussion.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.585
But how about the kid on the left,

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.103
or the athlete that leaves
the field of play?

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:20.759
How do we know if he or she
has sustained a concussion?

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.931
How do we know

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:26.515
that legislation that would require
they be pulled from play,

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.618
cleared for return to play,

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:29.816
applies to them?

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:32.287
The definition of concussion

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.944
doesn't actually require
a loss of consciousness.

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.721
It requires only a change
in consciousness,

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:40.357
and that can be any one
or a number of symptoms,

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:43.539
including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:45.238
hearing a ringing in your ear,

00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:47.920
being more impulsive
or hostile than usual.

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.047
So given all of that and given
how darn neurotic I am,

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:54.628
how do I get any sleep at all?

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:58.965
Because I know our brains are resilient.

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.324
They're designed to recover
from an injury.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.936
If -- God forbid --

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.156
any of us left here tonight
and sustained a concussion,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.656
most of us would go on to fully recover
inside of a couple hours

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.126
to a couple of weeks.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.471
But kids are more vulnerable
to brain injury.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:19.780
In fact, high-school athletes
are three times more likely

00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:22.152
to sustain catastrophic injuries

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:24.677
relative even to their college-age peers,

00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.366
and it takes them longer
to return to a symptom-free baseline.

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.238
After that first injury,

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:36.068
their risk for second injury
is exponentially greater.

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:41.005
From there, their risk for a third injury,
greater still, and so on.

00:04:42.012 --> 00:04:44.850
And here's the really alarming part:

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:50.167
We don't fully understand
the long-term impact of multiple injuries.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.283
You guys may be familiar
with this research

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:54.885
that's coming out of the NFL.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.467
In a nutshell,
this research suggests that,

00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:03.734
among retired NFL players
with three or more career concussions,

00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:06.734
the incidence of early-onset
dementing disease

00:05:06.758 --> 00:05:09.523
is much greater than it
is for the general population.

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:12.936
So you've all seen that --
New York Times, you've seen it.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.562
What you may not be familiar with

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:19.705
is that this research was spearheaded
by NFL wives who said,

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.706
"Isn't it weird
that my 46-year-old husband

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.393
is forever losing his keys?"

00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:27.564
"Isn't it weird that
my 47-year-old husband

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:29.468
is forever losing the car?"

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.960
"Isn't it weird that
my 48-year-old husband

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:35.005
is forever losing his way home

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:37.980
in the car, from the driveway?"

00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:42.891
I may have forgotten to mention
that my son is an only child.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.900
So it's going to be really important

00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:50.924
that he be able to drive
me around someday.

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:52.426
(Laughter)

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.282
So, how do we guarantee
the safety of our kids?

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:02.642
How can we 100 percent
guarantee the safety of our kids?

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:04.572
Let me tell you what I've come up with.

00:06:06.143 --> 00:06:10.936
(Laughter)

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.268
If only.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:15.281
My little boy's right there,
and he's like, "She's not kidding.

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:16.708
She's totally not kidding."

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:20.042
So in all seriousness:

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:21.713
Should my kid play football?

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:23.524
Should your kid play football?

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:24.714
I don't know.

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:28.245
But I do know there are
three things you can do.

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:31.111
The first: study up.

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:34.864
You have to be familiar with the issues
we're talking about today.

00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:37.454
There are some great resources out there.

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:39.772
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.430
It's at CDC.gov.

00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:44.842
HEADS UP is specific
to concussion in kids.

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:48.116
The second is a resource
I'm personally really proud of.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.782
We've just rolled this out
in the last couple months --

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:52.178
CO Kids With Brain Injury.

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.151
This is a great resource
for student athletes,

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:59.564
teachers, parents, professionals,
athletic and coaching staff.

00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:03.341
It's a great place to start
if you have questions.

00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:06.284
The second thing is: speak up.

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:08.674
Just two weeks ago,

00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:10.675
a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.609
that would have required
athletes, kids under 18,

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:16.947
to wear a helmet
when they're riding their bike,

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:18.235
died in committee.

00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:21.439
It died, in large part,

00:07:21.463 --> 00:07:24.393
because it lacked constituent buy-in;

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:26.530
it lacked stakeholder traction.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.336
Now, I'm not here to tell you

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.261
what kind of legislation
you should or shouldn't support,

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:34.359
but I am going to tell you
that, if it matters to you,

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:37.297
your legislators need to know that.

00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:39.727
Speak up also with coaching staff.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.728
Ask about what kind
of protective equipment is available.

00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:44.801
What's the budget
for protective equipment?

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:46.375
How old it is?

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:50.105
Maybe offer to spearhead
a fundraiser to buy new gear.

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.126
Which brings us to: suit up.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.617
Wear a helmet.

00:07:55.682 --> 00:07:58.936
The only way to prevent a bad outcome

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.960
is to prevent that first injury
from happening.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.519
Recently, one of my graduate
students, Tom, said,

00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:11.112
"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet
on the way to class."

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:15.840
And Tom knows that that little bit
of foam in a bike helmet

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:19.156
can reduce the g-force of impact by half.

00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:24.879
Now, I thought it was because I have
this totally compelling helmet crusade,

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:26.611
this epiphany of Tom's.

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:30.713
As it turns out, it occurred
to Tom that a $20 helmet

00:08:30.737 --> 00:08:34.936
is a good way to protect
a $100,000 graduate education.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.984
(Laughter)

00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:38.531
So ...

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:42.006
Should Vander play football?

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:44.674
I can't say no,

00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:48.936
but I can guarantee that every time
he leaves the house,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.569
that kid's wearing a helmet --

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:53.659
like, to the car,

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:55.397
or at school.

00:08:56.348 --> 00:08:59.029
So whether athlete, scholar,

00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:01.728
overprotected kid, neurotic mom,

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:03.538
or otherwise,

00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:05.450
here's my baby, Vander,

00:09:05.474 --> 00:09:06.855
reminding you

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.394
to mind your matter.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.128
Thank you.

00:09:11.152 --> 00:09:16.410
(Applause)
