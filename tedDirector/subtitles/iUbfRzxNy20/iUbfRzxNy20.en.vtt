00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.236
I think we have to do something

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.236
about a piece of the culture
of medicine that has to change.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.236
And I think it starts
with one physician, and that's me.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.236
And maybe I've been around long enough

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.927
that I can afford to give away
some of my false prestige

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:29.236
to be able to do that.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.356
Before I actually begin
the meat of my talk,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.236
let's begin with a bit of baseball.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.236
Hey, why not?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.236
We're near the end, we're getting
close to the World Series.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.236
We all love baseball, don't we?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.236
(Laughter)

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.236
Baseball is filled
with some amazing statistics.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.236
And there's hundreds of them.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
"Moneyball" is about to come out,
and it's all about statistics

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.761
and using statistics to build
a great baseball team.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.236
I'm going to focus on one stat

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.236
that I hope a lot of you have heard of.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.236
It's called batting average.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.236
So we talk about a 300,
a batter who bats 300.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.236
That means that ballplayer
batted safely, hit safely

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.236
three times out of 10 at bats.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
That means hit the ball into the outfield,

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:15.236
it dropped, it didn't get caught,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.499
and whoever tried to throw it to first
base didn't get there in time

00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:20.236
and the runner was safe.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.236
Three times out of 10.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.236
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.236
in Major League Baseball?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.236
Good, really good,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.236
maybe an all-star.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.236
Do you know what they call

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.236
a 400 baseball hitter?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.236
That's somebody who hit, by the way,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.236
four times safely out of every 10.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.236
Legendary --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.236
as in Ted Williams legendary --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.236
the last Major League Baseball player

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.236
to hit over 400 during a regular season.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.594
Now let's take this back
into my world of medicine

00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:56.236
where I'm a lot more comfortable,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.236
or perhaps a bit less comfortable

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.236
after what I'm going to talk to you about.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.236
Suppose you have appendicitis

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.236
and you're referred to a surgeon

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.236
who's batting 400 on appendectomies.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.236
(Laughter)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.236
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.236
Now suppose you live

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.236
in a certain part
of a certain remote place

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.236
and you have a loved one

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.236
who has blockages in two coronary arteries

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.236
and your family doctor refers
that loved one to a cardiologist

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.236
who's batting 200 on angioplasties.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.236
But, but, you know what?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.236
She's doing a lot better this year.
She's on the comeback trail.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.236
And she's hitting a 257.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.236
Somehow this isn't working.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.236
But I'm going to ask you a question.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.236
What do you think a batting average

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.403
for a cardiac surgeon
or a nurse practitioner

00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:47.236
or an orthopedic surgeon,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.236
an OBGYN, a paramedic

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.236
is supposed to be?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.236
1,000, very good.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.236
Now truth of the matter is,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.236
nobody knows in all of medicine

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.236
what a good surgeon

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.236
or physician or paramedic

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.236
is supposed to bat.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.236
What we do though is we send
each one of them, including myself,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.236
out into the world

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.236
with the admonition, be perfect.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.236
Never ever, ever make a mistake,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.403
but you worry about the details,
about how that's going to happen.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:18.403
And that was the message that I absorbed

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:20.236
when I was in med school.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.236
I was an obsessive compulsive student.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.236
In high school, a classmate once said

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.546
that Brian Goldman would study
for a blood test.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.236
(Laughter)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.236
And so I did.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.236
And I studied in my little garret

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.784
at the nurses' residence
at Toronto General Hospital,

00:03:37.808 --> 00:03:39.236
not far from here.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.236
And I memorized everything.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.236
I memorized in my anatomy class

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the origins and exertions of every muscle,

00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:48.236
every branch of every artery
that came off the aorta,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.236
differential diagnoses obscure and common.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.236
I even knew the differential diagnosis

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.

00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:57.236
And all the while,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.236
I was amassing more and more knowledge.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.236
And I did well, I graduated with honors,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.236
cum laude.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.236
And I came out of medical school

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.236
with the impression

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.689
that if I memorized everything
and knew everything,

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:12.236
or as much as possible,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.236
as close to everything as possible,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.236
that it would immunize me
against making mistakes.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.236
And it worked

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.236
for a while,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.236
until I met Mrs. Drucker.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.236
I was a resident at a teaching
hospital here in Toronto

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.236
when Mrs. Drucker was brought
to the emergency department

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.236
of the hospital where I was working.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.736
At the time I was assigned
to the cardiology service

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.236
on a cardiology rotation.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.236
And it was my job,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.975
when the emergency staff called
for a cardiology consult,

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.236
to see that patient in emerg.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.236
and to report back to my attending.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.236
And I saw Mrs. Drucker,
and she was breathless.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.236
And when I listened to her,
she was making a wheezy sound.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.236
And when I listened to her
chest with a stethoscope,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.236
I could hear crackly sounds on both sides

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.236
that told me that she was in congestive
heart failure.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.236
This is a condition
in which the heart fails,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.236
and instead of being able
to pump all the blood forward,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.236
some of the blood backs up into the lung,
the lungs fill up with blood,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.356
and that's why you have
shortness of breath.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.236
And that wasn't a difficult
diagnosis to make.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.236
I made it and I set to work treating her.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.236
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications
to relieve the strain on her heart.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.236
I gave her medications that we call
diuretics, water pills,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.236
to get her to pee out the access fluid.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.880
And over the course
of the next hour and a half or two,

00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:27.236
she started to feel better.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.236
And I felt really good.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.236
And that's when I made my first mistake;

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.236
I sent her home.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.236
Actually, I made two more mistakes.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.236
I sent her home

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.236
without speaking to my attending.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.236
I didn't pick up the phone and do
what I was supposed to do,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.737
which was call my attending
and run the story by him

00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:50.236
so he would have a chance
to see her for himself.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.236
And he knew her,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.499
he would have been able to furnish
additional information about her.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.236
Maybe I did it for a good reason.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.236
Maybe I didn't want to be
a high-maintenance resident.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.236
Maybe I wanted to be so successful

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.236
and so able to take responsibility

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.236
that I would do so

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.236
and I would be able to take
care of my attending's patients

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.236
without even having to contact him.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.236
The second mistake that I made was worse.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.236
In sending her home,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.403
I disregarded a little voice
deep down inside

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.236
that was trying to tell me,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.236
"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.236
In fact, so lacking in confidence was I

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.236
that I actually asked the nurse

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.236
who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.236
"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.236
And the nurse thought about it

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.236
and said very matter-of-factly,
"Yeah, I think she'll do okay."

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.236
I can remember that like it was yesterday.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.236
So I signed the discharge papers,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.236
and an ambulance came, paramedics
came to take her home.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.236
And I went back to my work on the wards.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.236
All the rest of that day,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.236
that afternoon,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.236
I had this kind of gnawing
feeling inside my stomach.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.236
But I carried on with my work.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.236
And at the end of the day,
I packed up to leave the hospital

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.236
and walked to the parking lot

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.236
to take my car and drive home

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.236
when I did something
that I don't usually do.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.236
I walked through the emergency
department on my way home.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.236
And it was there that another nurse,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.832
not the nurse who was looking
after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,

00:07:16.856 --> 00:07:19.236
said three words to me

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.236
that are the three words

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.236
that most emergency
physicians I know dread.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.236
Others in medicine dread them as well,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.975
but there's something particular
about emergency medicine

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.236
because we see patients so fleetingly.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.236
The three words are:

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.236
Do you remember?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.236
"Do you remember
that patient you sent home?"

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.236
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.236
"Well she's back,"

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.236
in just that tone of voice.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.236
Well she was back all right.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.236
She was back and near death.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.236
About an hour after she had arrived home,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.236
after I'd sent her home,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.236
she collapsed and her family called 911

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.236
and the paramedics brought her
back to the emergency department

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.236
where she had a blood pressure of 50,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.236
which is in severe shock.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.236
And she was barely breathing
and she was blue.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.236
And the emerg. staff
pulled out all the stops.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.236
They gave her medications
to raise her blood pressure.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.236
They put her on a ventilator.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.236
And I was shocked

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.236
and shaken to the core.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.236
And I went through this roller coaster,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.236
because after they stabilized her,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.236
she went to the intensive care unit,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.236
and I hoped against hope
that she would recover.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.236
And over the next two or three days,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.594
it was clear that she was never
going to wake up.

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:36.236
She had irreversible brain damage.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.236
And the family gathered.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.236
And over the course
of the next eight or nine days,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.499
they resigned themselves
to what was happening.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.236
And at about the nine day
mark, they let her go --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.236
Mrs. Drucker,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.236
a wife, a mother

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.236
and a grandmother.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.236
They say you never forget the names

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.236
of those who die.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.236
And that was my first time
to be acquainted with that.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.236
Over the next few weeks,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.236
I beat myself up

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.236
and I experienced for the first time

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.236
the unhealthy shame that exists

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.236
in our culture of medicine --

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.236
where I felt alone, isolated,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.236
not feeling the healthy kind
of shame that you feel,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.784
because you can't talk
about it with your colleagues.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.236
You know that healthy kind,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.880
when you betray a secret that a best
friend made you promise never to reveal

00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:25.236
and then you get busted

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.236
and then your best friend confronts you

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.236
and you have terrible discussions,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.236
but at the end of it
all that sick feeling guides you

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.546
and you say, I'll never
make that mistake again.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.546
And you make amends and you
never make that mistake again.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.236
That's the kind of shame
that is a teacher.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.236
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.236
is the one that makes you so sick inside.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.236
It's the one that says,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.236
not that what you did was bad,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.236
but that you are bad.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.236
And it was what I was feeling.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.236
And it wasn't because of my attending;
he was a doll.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.689
He talked to the family, and I'm quite
sure that he smoothed things over

00:10:00.713 --> 00:10:03.236
and made sure that I didn't get sued.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.236
And I kept asking myself these questions.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.236
Why didn't I ask my attending?
Why did I send her home?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.236
And then at my worst moments:

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.236
Why did I make such a stupid mistake?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.236
Why did I go into medicine?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.236
Slowly but surely,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.236
it lifted.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.236
I began to feel a bit better.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.236
And on a cloudy day,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.213
there was a crack in the clouds
and the sun started to come out

00:10:27.237 --> 00:10:28.236
and I wondered,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.236
maybe I could feel better again.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.236
And I made myself a bargain

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.236
that if only I redouble
my efforts to be perfect

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.236
and never make another mistake again,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.236
please make the voices stop.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.236
And they did.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.236
And I went back to work.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.236
And then it happened again.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.236
Two years later I was an attending
in the emergency department

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.451
at a community hospital
just north of Toronto,

00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:57.236
and I saw a 25 year-old
man with a sore throat.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.236
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.236
He kept pointing here.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.594
I looked at his throat,
it was a little bit pink.

00:11:03.618 --> 00:11:05.714
And I gave him a prescription
for penicillin

00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:07.236
and sent him on his way.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.236
And even as he was walking out the door,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.236
he was still sort
of pointing to his throat.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.236
And two days later I came to do
my next emergency shift,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.499
and that's when my chief asked
to speak to me quietly in her office.

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:22.236
And she said the three words:

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.236
Do you remember?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.236
"Do you remember that patient
you saw with the sore throat?"

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.594
Well it turns out, he didn't
have a strep throat.

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:32.857
He had a potentially
life-threatening condition

00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:34.236
called epiglottitis.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.236
You can Google it,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.403
but it's an infection, not
of the throat, but of the upper airway,

00:11:39.427 --> 00:11:42.236
and it can actually cause
the airway to close.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.236
And fortunately he didn't die.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.236
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.236
and he recovered after a few days.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.236
And I went through the same period
of shame and recriminations

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.236
and felt cleansed and went back to work,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.236
until it happened again
and again and again.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.236
Twice in one emergency shift,
I missed appendicitis.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.236
Now that takes some doing,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.236
especially when you work in a hospital

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.236
that at the time saw
but 14 people a night.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.236
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.594
and I don't think there
was any gap in their care.

00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:21.236
One I thought had a kidney stone.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.236
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When
it turned out to be normal,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.236
my colleague who was doing
a reassessment of the patient

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.236
noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant and called the surgeons.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.236
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.236
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.236
and asked my colleague to reassess him.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.236
And he did

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.236
and when he noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant, called the surgeons.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.236
In both cases,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.236
they had their operations
and they did okay.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.236
But each time,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.236
they were gnawing at me, eating at me.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.236
And I'd like to be able to say to you

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.689
that my worst mistakes only happened
in the first five years of practice

00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:58.236
as many of my colleagues
say, which is total B.S.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.236
(Laughter)

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Some of my doozies have
been in the last five years.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.236
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.236
Here's the problem:

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.236
If I can't come clean

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.236
and talk about my mistakes,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.236
if I can't find the still-small voice

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.236
that tells me what really happened,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.236
how can I share it with my colleagues?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.236
How can I teach them about what I did

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.236
so that they don't do the same thing?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.236
If I were to walk into a room --

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.236
like right now, I have no
idea what you think of me.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.236
When was the last time
you heard somebody talk

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
about failure after failure after failure?

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.236
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.308
and you might hear
about some other doctor,

00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:44.236
but you're not going to hear somebody

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.236
talking about their own mistakes.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.236
If I were to walk into a room
filled with my colleages

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.236
and ask for their support right now

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.689
and start to tell what I've just
told you right now,

00:13:53.713 --> 00:13:56.236
I probably wouldn't get
through two of those stories

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.737
before they would start
to get really uncomfortable,

00:13:58.761 --> 00:14:00.236
somebody would crack a joke,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
they'd change the subject
and we would move on.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.236
And in fact, if I knew
and my colleagues knew

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.236
that one of my orthopedic colleagues
took off the wrong leg in my hospital,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.236
believe me, I'd have trouble

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.236
making eye contact with that person.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.236
That's the system that we have.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.236
It's a complete denial of mistakes.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.236
It's a system

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.236
in which there are two kinds
of physicians --

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.236
those who make mistakes

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.236
and those who don't,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.236
those who can't handle sleep
deprivation and those who can,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.236
those who have lousy outcomes

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.236
and those who have great outcomes.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.403
And it's almost
like an ideological reaction,

00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:45.236
like the antibodies begin
to attack that person.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.236
And we have this idea

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.403
that if we drive the people
who make mistakes

00:14:49.427 --> 00:14:51.236
out of medicine,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.236
what will we be left
with, but a safe system.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.236
But there are two problems with that.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.236
In my 20 years or so

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.236
of medical broadcasting and journalism,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.499
I've made a personal study of medical
malpractice and medical errors

00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:08.236
to learn everything I can,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.070
from one of the first articles
I wrote for the Toronto Star

00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:13.236
to my show "White Coat, Black Art."

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.236
And what I've learned

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.236
is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.236
We work in a system

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.236
where errors happen every day,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.236
where one in 10 medications

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.594
are either the wrong
medication given in hospital

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:28.236
or at the wrong dosage,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.594
where hospital-acquired infections
are getting more and more numerous,

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:34.236
causing havoc and death.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.236
In this country,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.236
as many as 24,000 Canadians die

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.236
of preventable medical errors.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.236
In the United States, the Institute
of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.236
In both cases, these
are gross underestimates,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.641
because we really aren't
ferreting out the problem

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:51.236
as we should.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.236
And here's the thing.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.236
In a hospital system

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.236
where medical knowledge is doubling

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.236
every two or three years,
we can't keep up with it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.236
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.236
We can't get rid of it.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.236
We have our cognitive biases,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.403
so that I can take a perfect history
on a patient with chest pain.

00:16:12.427 --> 00:16:14.427
Now take the same patient with chest pain,

00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:16.236
make them moist and garrulous

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.236
and put a little bit
of alcohol on their breath,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.499
and suddenly my history
is laced with contempt.

00:16:20.523 --> 00:16:22.236
I don't take the same history.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.236
I'm not a robot;

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.236
I don't do things the same way each time.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.236
And my patients aren't cars;

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.236
they don't tell me their symptoms
in the same way each time.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.236
Given all of that,
mistakes are inevitable.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.236
So if you take the system,
as I was taught,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.236
and weed out all the error-prone
health professionals,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
well there won't be anybody left.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.236
And you know that business

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.236
about people not wanting

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.236
to talk about their worst cases?

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.236
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.880
I made it a habit of saying,
"Here's my worst mistake,"

00:16:57.904 --> 00:16:59.236
I would say to everybody

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.236
from paramedics to the chief
of cardiac surgery,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.236
"Here's my worst mistake,"
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.403
"What about yours?" and I would point
the microphone towards them.

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.236
And their pupils would dilate,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.236
they would recoil,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.236
then they would look down and swallow hard

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.236
and start to tell me their stories.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.403
They want to tell their stories.
They want to share their stories.

00:17:20.426 --> 00:17:22.236
They want to be able to say,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
"Look, don't make the same mistake I did."

00:17:24.283 --> 00:17:26.904
What they need is an environment
to be able to do that.

00:17:26.927 --> 00:17:30.236
What they need is a redefined
medical culture.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.236
And it starts
with one physician at a time.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.236
The redefined physician is human,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.236
knows she's human,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.308
accepts it, isn't proud
of making mistakes,

00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:42.236
but strives to learn one thing

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.236
from what happened

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.236
that she can teach to somebody else.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.236
She shares her experience with others.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.236
She's supportive when other
people talk about their mistakes.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.308
And she points out other
people's mistakes,

00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:55.236
not in a gotcha way,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.236
but in a loving, supportive way

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.236
so that everybody can benefit.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.236
And she works in a culture of medicine

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.236
that acknowledges

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.236
that human beings run the system,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.070
and when human beings run the system,
they will make mistakes from time to time.

00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:13.236
So the system is evolving

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.236
to create backups

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.236
that make it easier
to detect those mistakes

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.236
that humans inevitably make

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.236
and also fosters
in a loving, supportive way

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.236
places where everybody who is observing

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.236
in the health care system

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.236
can actually point out things
that could be potential mistakes

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.236
and is rewarded for doing so,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.927
and especially people like me,
when we do make mistakes,

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.236
we're rewarded for coming clean.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.236
My name is Brian Goldman.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.236
I am a redefined physician.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.236
I'm human. I make mistakes.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.236
I'm sorry about that,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.236
but I strive to learn one thing

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.236
that I can pass on to other people.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.236
I still don't know what you think of me,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.236
but I can live with that.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.236
And let me close
with three words of my own:

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.236
I do remember.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:22.260
(Applause)
