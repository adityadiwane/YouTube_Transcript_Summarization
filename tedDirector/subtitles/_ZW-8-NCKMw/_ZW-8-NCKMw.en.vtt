00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.022
In the spring of 2016,

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:19.450
a legal battle between Apple
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.152
captured the world's attention.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.972
Apple has built security features
into its mobile products

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:28.829
which protect data on its devices
from everyone but the owner.

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:33.498
That means that criminals, hackers
and yes, even governments

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:34.842
are all locked out.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.779
For Apple's customers,
this is a great thing.

00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:40.620
But governments are not so happy.

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:43.469
You see, Apple has made
a conscious decision

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.053
to get out of the surveillance business.

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:49.288
Apple has tried to make surveillance
as difficult as possible

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:51.678
for governments and any other actors.

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.006
There are really two
smartphone operating systems

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.658
in the global smartphone market:

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.396
iOS and Android.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.817
iOS is made by Apple.
Android is made by Google.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.570
Apple has spent a lot of time and money

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:09.865
to make sure that its products
are as secure as possible.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:13.892
Apple encrypts all data
stored on iPhones by default,

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.922
and text messages sent from one
Apple customer to another Apple customer

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.648
are encrypted by default

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:22.189
without the user having
to take any actions.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:24.380
What this means is that,

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:28.184
if the police seize an iPhone
and it has a password,

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:32.366
they'll have a difficult time
getting any data off of it,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.802
if they can do it at all.

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:38.512
In contrast, the security of Android
just really isn't as good.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.582
Android phones, or at least
most of the Android phones

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.212
that have been sold to consumers,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.091
do not encrypt data stored
on the device by default,

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:51.101
and the built-in text messaging app
in Android does not use encryption.

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:54.249
So if the police seize an Android phone,

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:57.630
chances are, they'll be able to get
all the data they want

00:01:57.654 --> 00:01:58.946
off of that device.

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.544
Two smartphones

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:03.901
from two of the biggest
companies in the world;

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.282
one that protects data by default,

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:08.222
and one that doesn't.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.982
Apple is a seller of luxury goods.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.255
It dominates the high end of the market.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.064
And we would expect a manufacturer
of luxury goods to have products

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:21.045
that include more features.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.974
But not everyone can afford an iPhone.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.585
That's where Android
really, really dominates:

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.360
at the middle and low end of the market,

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:32.010
smartphones for the billion
and a half people

00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:34.904
who cannot or will not spend

00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:37.389
600 dollars on a phone.

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:47.105
But the dominance of Android
has led to what I call

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.341
the "digital security divide."

00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:52.350
That is, there is now increasingly a gap

00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:56.499
between the privacy
and security of the rich,

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:59.293
who can afford devices
that secure their data by default,

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:01.288
and of the poor,

00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:06.525
whose devices do very little
to protect them by default.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:10.782
So, think of the average Apple customer:

00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:16.875
a banker, a lawyer,
a doctor, a politician.

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:22.641
These individuals now increasingly have
smartphones in their pockets

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.138
that encrypt their calls,
their text messages,

00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:27.697
all the data on the device,

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.729
without them doing really anything
to secure their information.

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:36.949
In contrast, the poor
and the most vulnerable in our societies

00:03:36.973 --> 00:03:42.160
are using devices that leave them
completely vulnerable to surveillance.

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:45.054
In the United States, where I live,

00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:49.027
African-Americans are more likely
to be seen as suspicious

00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.902
or more likely to be profiled,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.305
and are more likely to be targeted
by the state with surveillance.

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.797
But African-Americans
are also disproportionately likely

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.917
to use Android devices
that do nothing at all

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.011
to protect them from that surveillance.

00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:06.298
This is a problem.

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:10.045
We must remember
that surveillance is a tool.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.458
It's a tool used by those in power

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:16.192
against those who have no power.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.923
And while I think it's absolutely great

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:25.395
that companies like Apple
are making it easy for people to encrypt,

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:30.170
if the only people
who can protect themselves

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:31.685
from the gaze of the government

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:33.269
are the rich and powerful,

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.928
that's a problem.

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:39.111
And it's not just a privacy
or a cybersecurity problem.

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:41.283
It's a civil rights problem.

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:45.673
So the lack of default security in Android

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:51.076
is not just a problem
for the poor and vulnerable users

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.318
who are depending on these devices.

00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.602
This is actually a problem
for our democracy.

00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:57.705
I'll explain what I mean.

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:01.389
Modern social movements
rely on technology --

00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:06.836
from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring
to Occupy Wall Street.

00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:11.213
The organizers of these movements
and the members of these movements

00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:15.177
increasingly communicate
and coordinate with smartphones.

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:20.297
And so, naturally governments
that feel threatened by these movements

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.977
will also target the organizers
and their smartphones.

00:05:25.462 --> 00:05:27.536
Now, it's quite possible

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.624
that a future Martin Luther King
or a Mandela or a Gandhi

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:35.505
will have an iPhone and be protected
from government surveillance.

00:05:36.283 --> 00:05:37.830
But chances are,

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:41.568
they'll probably have a cheap,
$20 Android phone in their pocket.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.497
And so if we do nothing
to address the digital security divide,

00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:50.389
if we do nothing to ensure
that everyone in our society

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.452
gets the same benefits of encryption

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:57.133
and is equally able to protect themselves
from surveillance by the state,

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:01.939
not only will the poor and vulnerable
be exposed to surveillance,

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.345
but future civil rights
movements may be crushed

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:07.789
before they ever reach
their full potential.

00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:08.980
Thank you.

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:12.111
(Applause)

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.866
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.762
I have a question for you.

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:21.639
We saw recently in the press

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:27.167
that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook
covers over his camera

00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:30.165
and does something
with his headphone mic jack.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.734
So I wanted to ask you
a personal question, which is:

00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:33.910
Do you do that?

00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:36.513
And, on behalf of everyone
here, particularly myself,

00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:37.862
Should we be doing that?

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:39.654
Should we be covering these things?

00:06:39.678 --> 00:06:43.839
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --
actually, I like Band-Aids,

00:06:43.863 --> 00:06:46.128
because you can remove them
and put them back on

00:06:46.152 --> 00:06:48.464
whenever you want to make
a call or a Skype call.

00:06:48.488 --> 00:06:50.190
Putting a sticker over your web cam

00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:52.890
is probably the best thing
you can do for your privacy

00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.420
in terms of bang for buck.

00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:58.341
There really is malware,
malicious software out there

00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:00.222
that can take over your web cam,

00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:02.116
even without the light turning on.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.309
This is used by criminals.
This is used by stalkers.

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:10.271
You can buy $19.99 "spy
on your ex-girlfriend" software online.

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:11.446
It's really terrifying.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.994
And then, of course,
it's used by governments.

00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:17.239
And there's obviously
a sexual violence component to this,

00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:20.964
which is that this kind of surveillance
can be used most effectively

00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:27.791
against women and other people
who can be shamed in our society.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:30.525
Even if you think
you have nothing to hide,

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:35.107
at the very least, if you have
children, teenagers in your lives,

00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:38.141
make sure you put a sticker
on their camera and protect them.

00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:40.159
HW: Wow. Thank you so much.
CS: Thank you.

00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:41.334
HW: Thanks, Chris.

00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:43.830
(Applause)
