(Music)

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
♫ I don't understand myself, ♫

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
♫ if they come near me, ♫

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.260
♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
♫ I don't understand myself, ♫

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.260
♫ why they talk of magic, ♫

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
♫ that no one withstands, ♫

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.260
♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260
♫ But if the red light is on ♫

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
♫ in the middle of the night ♫

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:30.260
♫ then it is plain to see. ♫

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.260
♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.260
♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.260
♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.260
♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.260
♫ My feet, they glide and float, ♫

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:17.260
♫ my eyes, they lure and glow. ♫

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:27.260
♫ And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, ♫

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:39.260
♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
♫ In my veins, ♫

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
♫ runs a dancer's blood, ♫

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
♫ because my beautiful mother ♫

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
♫ was the Queen of dance ♫

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
♫ in the gilded Alcazar. ♫

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
♫ She was so very beautiful, ♫

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260
♫ I often saw her in my dreams. ♫

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
♫ If she beat the tambourine ♫

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.260
♫ to her beguiling dance,
all eyes were glowing admiringly. ♫

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.260
♫ She reawakened in me, ♫

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
♫ mine is the same lot. ♫

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
♫ I dance like her at midnight ♫

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.260
♫ and from deep within I feel: ♫

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.260
♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:33.260
♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.260
♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.260
♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:13.260
♫ And I dance as if entranced, 
'cause I know, ♫

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:30.260
♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:48.260
(Applause)
