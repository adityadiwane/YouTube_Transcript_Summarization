00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it all points to evidence that life

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for the human species as we know it began right here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We are on an amazing journey the next four days.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And this is not a rhetorical question.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I actually want answers from you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Go for it! The worst.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Famine.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Corruption.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
More.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Genocide.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
AIDS.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Slavery.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's enough.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We've all heard these things.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The stories that we want to know,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the stories that do exist about positive tales.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that exist on this continent,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To go to the actual data and statistics that exist

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
about the actual things that are happening on the ground

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So let's get going because Africa,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to some degree, is on a turnaround.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and how it takes control of its own destiny.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And turnarounds are part and parcel

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And it all started almost a decade ago,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
at their first African office in Johannesburg.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And there we worked with leading CEOs

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
making the companies not just the best in Africa

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but the best globally.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when I was completing my MBA in the United States.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It all began with a fantastic phone call.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a case on a public-sector leader

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that has lessons for the corporate world."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
faced a situation of a country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
became part of the research base for a chapter

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that was used to share news with the rest of the world

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Africa was being used as a success story!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So I want to share with you a personal story

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
about a turnaround or a transformation.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that has to do with me

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and headed off for a year of travel

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
in the middle of my university career.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You should have seen my parents' reaction!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Laughter)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I sought out the most remote places.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but the key thing is that it was the place

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that Alexander the Great went to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and it foretold his destiny of greatness.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
This was 300 BC.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, the thing I remember about Siwa

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
was the magical view of the sky at night.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Fast forward to 2002.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
at the Healthcare Development Conference.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The first thing that I saw was North America at night --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And while Africa may be dark,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the thing that brought the message home to me

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
was that this is the challenge we are facing,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
but it's also the opportunity.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that exist north and in the south and other areas --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
it's aglow with the light in the hearts

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
of the millions of people that are there.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that has so much to offer.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Let's start unpacking it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It also is the second most populated continent,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
with 900 million people.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that you could fit in the continental United States,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Africa is home to over 1,000 languages --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
2,000 is another estimate that's out there --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with over 2,000 languages and dialects.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and it wouldn't make a difference."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
What does the data say?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and the changes that are taking place in capital markets.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and winds of change that are sweeping this continent.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So let's start on that.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that's the first sign --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
in many countries reaching double-digit figures.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So let's start looking at some of those.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to the nine percent.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Nigeria: a similar situation,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
currencies going through an extreme time of stability.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But that's looking at the big picture.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It's made up --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Applause)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's made up of 53 different countries.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So the very definition -- to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's meaningless.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Each country has a unique value proposition.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You can make money, you can lose money in Africa.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And this is what today is about --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it's about discussing those very opportunities.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So let's start getting into the countries

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and into the specific material and data.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
because it is a fascinating position to be in.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But not the South Africa we always talk about --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
a bit about the other side of it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But what were they there for? To acquire assets.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Because it is actually a long-term play.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
because there's so much happening.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Is anyone -- our banks, our investors --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
If you haven't, why not?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Bellwether signs again.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
offshore, off its own balance sheet,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
without any sovereign backing --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Without any sovereign backing,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
a Nigerian company raising capital offshore.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's just a sign of things to come.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It's an important strategic partner.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Let's put Nigeria in perspective.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And Emeka and I have had these discussions.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For Africa to truly be sustainable,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
we have to move beyond to other industries.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So let's unpack those very quickly,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
because I can see that clock counting down.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
What else is going on there? Egypt.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
2.8 billion investment.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The announcement just came out the last few weeks.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
textiles, petrochemicals.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
across the industries -- away from oil.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
What's going on there?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
In Tanzania last week, we had the launch

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of the East African Organic Produce Standard.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
It ties in with small-scale farmers

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Uganda: the New Forest Company,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
poles for rolling out electricity.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But here is the sweetener in the deal.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Let's go back to Nigeria.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
135 million-plus people. Think about that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
The same for telecoms across the country.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Now let's look at the continent as a whole.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
inflation is affected.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
or stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:28.000
In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
What's going on in some of the other countries?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
These are the trends that are taking place.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
But in any investment decision, the key question is,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
"What is my alternative investment?"

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
What Africa is providing is a diversification play,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that's aware of what he or she is doing.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
comparisons become important.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
10 years ago there, were very few countries

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
that received sovereign ratings from

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
the Standard &amp; Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Today, 16 African countries and growing

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
The backbone of making investment decisions

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
for global holders of capital.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So one of the big bellwethers,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and one of my final points I want to mention, is

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the interesting thing I read is that CNBC

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
the investments the world is going to be making --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Because there are amazing opportunities available.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And think about the concept of transformation

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
in the back of your mind

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
because things can be turned around rather quickly.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
In 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,"

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
generating light -- the old heart of darkness

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
now generating light with hydro-electric power.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That is a transformation in power of ideas.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
So the next step, over the next four days,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
is us exploring more of these ideas.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
that picture will look very different.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Thank you.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
(Applause)
