00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Good morning everybody.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I work with really amazing,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And let me tell you what it's like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
to grow these cells in the lab.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
We plate them into dishes

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
that we sometimes call petri dishes.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And we feed them -- sterilely of course --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and we grow them in incubators.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Why do I do this?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
We observe the cells in a plate,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and they're just on the surface.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
But what we're really trying to do in my lab

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
is to engineer tissues out of them.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
What does that even mean?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Well it means growing an actual heart,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
let's say,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
or grow a piece of bone

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that can be put into the body.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Not only that, but they can also be used for disease models.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
just really aren't enough.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The cells are kind of homesick;

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
the dish doesn't feel like their home.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to get them to thrive.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
We call this the biomimetic paradigm --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
copying nature in the lab.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Let's take the example of the heart,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the topic of a lot of my research.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
What makes the heart unique?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Well, the heart beats,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
We copy this in the lab

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
to get the cells to contract in the lab.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
What else do we know about the heart?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
with a very, very dense blood supply.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
In the lab, we micro-pattern channels

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
in the biomaterials

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
on which we grow the cells,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
a lot like what you might expect

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
from a capillary bed in the heart.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So this brings me to lesson number one:

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
life can do a lot with very little.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
that I engineered from rat cells in the lab.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And after one week, it's beating.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But don't worry if you can't see it so well.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
It's amazing that these cells beat at all.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
But what's really amazing

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
like with a pacemaker,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that they beat so much more.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
But that brings me to lesson number two:

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
cells do all the work.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
because structural engineers

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
build bridges and big things,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
computer engineers, computers,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but what we are doing

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
What does this mean for us?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Let's do something really simple.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Let's remind ourselves

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that cells are not an abstract concept.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
in a very real way.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
"We are what we eat," could easily be described

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
as, "We are what our cells eat."

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And in the case of the flora in our gut,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
these cells may not even be human.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
But it's also worth noting

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that cells also mediate our experience of life.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is a corresponding set of cells

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that receive this information

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and interpret it for us.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
It begs the question:

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I invite you to talk about this with me further,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and in the meantime, I wish you luck.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
May none of your non-cancer cells

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
become endangered species.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Thank you.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
(Applause)
