00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:14.618
At every stage of our lives

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:18.186
we make decisions that will profoundly influence

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:20.072
the lives of the people we're going to become,

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:21.692
and then when we become those people,

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:24.110
we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.624
So young people pay good money

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:29.328
to get tattoos removed that teenagers

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.698
paid good money to get.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.206
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:35.823
who young adults rushed to marry.

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:38.460
Older adults work hard to lose

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.160
what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.276
On and on and on.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.308
The question is, as a psychologist,
that fascinates me is,

00:00:45.308 --> 00:00:47.060
why do we make decisions

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.756
that our future selves so often regret?

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.608
Now, I think one of the reasons --

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.060
I'll try to convince you today —

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.620
is that we have a fundamental misconception

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.452
about the power of time.

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:01.932
Every one of you knows that the rate of change

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:03.854
slows over the human lifespan,

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:06.712
that your children seem to change by the minute

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.466
but your parents seem to change by the year.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.886
But what is the name of this magical point in life

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:14.922
where change suddenly goes

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.704
from a gallop to a crawl?

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:19.440
Is it teenage years? Is it middle age?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.110
Is it old age? The answer, it turns out,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.640
for most people, is now,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.591
wherever now happens to be.

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.593
What I want to convince you today

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:32.612
is that all of us are walking around with an illusion,

00:01:32.612 --> 00:01:35.830
an illusion that history, our personal history,

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.444
has just come to an end,

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:39.051
that we have just recently become

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:42.206
the people that we were always meant to be

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:44.652
and will be for the rest of our lives.

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:46.756
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:49.910
So here's a study of change in people's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.942
personal values over time.

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:53.141
Here's three values.

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:54.656
Everybody here holds all of them,

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.814
but you probably know that as you grow,

00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:00.173
as you age, the balance of these values shifts.

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:02.082
So how does it do so?

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:04.090
Well, we asked thousands of people.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.877
We asked half of them to predict for us

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:08.887
how much their values would
change in the next 10 years,

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.263
and the others to tell us

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.513
how much their values had
changed in the last 10 years.

00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:16.980
And this enabled us to do a really
interesting kind of analysis,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.191
because it allowed us to compare the predictions

00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.185
of people, say, 18 years old,

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:23.297
to the reports of people who were 28,

00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:25.917
and to do that kind of analysis
throughout the lifespan.

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.248
Here's what we found.

00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:28.541
First of all, you are right,

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.389
change does slow down as we age,

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.281
but second, you're wrong,

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.679
because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.542
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:44.252
people vastly underestimated how much change

00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:47.171
they would experience over the next 10 years.

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:50.105
We call this the "end of history" illusion.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:52.488
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:53.710
you can connect these two lines,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.474
and what you see here is that 18-year-olds

00:02:56.474 --> 00:02:58.943
anticipate changing only as much

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:01.928
as 50-year-olds actually do.

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:05.482
Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:07.300
For example, personality.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.966
Many of you know that psychologists now claim

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.260
that there are five fundamental
dimensions of personality:

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.527
neuroticism, openness to experience,

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:19.375
agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:21.622
Again, we asked people how much they expected

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:23.198
to change over the next 10 years,

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:26.559
and also how much they had
changed over the last 10 years,

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:27.475
and what we found,

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:30.030
well, you're going to get used to
seeing this diagram over and over,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.069
because once again the rate of change

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.679
does slow as we age,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.567
but at every age, people underestimate

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.900
how much their personalities will change

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.684
in the next decade.

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:44.005
And it isn't just ephemeral things

00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:45.859
like values and personality.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.874
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:50.328
their basic preferences.

00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:53.130
For example, name your best friend,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.546
your favorite kind of vacation,

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:56.312
what's your favorite hobby,

00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:58.123
what's your favorite kind of music.

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.560
People can name these things.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.920
We ask half of them to tell us,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.313
"Do you think that that will
change over the next 10 years?"

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:06.467
and half of them to tell us,

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:09.158
"Did that change over the last 10 years?"

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.741
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:13.583
and here it is again:

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.663
people predict that the friend they have now

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:18.211
is the friend they'll have in 10 years,

00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:20.316
the vacation they most enjoy now is the one

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:21.648
they'll enjoy in 10 years,

00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:24.390
and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.319
"Eh, you know, that's really changed."

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.475
Does any of this matter?

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:31.635
Is this just a form of mis-prediction
that doesn't have consequences?

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:34.557
No, it matters quite a bit, and
I'll give you an example of why.

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.022
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.

00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:39.727
Bring to mind right now for yourself

00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:42.000
your favorite musician today

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.368
and your favorite musician 10 years ago.

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.927
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.

00:04:46.927 --> 00:04:48.530
Now we asked people

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.767
to predict for us, to tell us

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.654
how much money they would pay right now

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.990
to see their current favorite musician

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.507
perform in concert 10 years from now,

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.554
and on average, people said they would pay

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:03.271
129 dollars for that ticket.

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.198
And yet, when we asked them
how much they would pay

00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:08.519
to see the person who was their favorite

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.558
10 years ago perform today,

00:05:10.558 --> 00:05:12.400
they say only 80 dollars.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.238
Now, in a perfectly rational world,

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:16.352
these should be the same number,

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:18.863
but we overpay for the opportunity

00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:20.966
to indulge our current preferences

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.286
because we overestimate their stability.

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:26.734
Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure,

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.280
but it probably has to do

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.459
with the ease of remembering

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.980
versus the difficulty of imagining.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.449
Most of us can remember
who we were 10 years ago,

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.188
but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:41.193
and then we mistakenly think
that because it's hard to imagine,

00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:43.267
it's not likely to happen.

00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:46.522
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"

00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:49.470
they're usually talking about
their own lack of imagination,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.962
and not about the unlikelihood

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:53.952
of the event that they're describing.

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:57.519
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.162
It transforms our preferences.

00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:01.280
It reshapes our values.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.623
It alters our personalities.

00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:05.190
We seem to appreciate this fact,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.751
but only in retrospect.

00:06:06.751 --> 00:06:09.246
Only when we look backwards do we realize

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:12.518
how much change happens in a decade.

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:14.197
It's as if, for most of us,

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:16.366
the present is a magic time.

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:18.383
It's a watershed on the timeline.

00:06:18.383 --> 00:06:20.727
It's the moment at which we finally

00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:23.230
become ourselves.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.923
Human beings are works in progress

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:28.846
that mistakenly think they're finished.

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.636
The person you are right now

00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:34.338
is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary

00:06:34.338 --> 00:06:36.997
as all the people you've ever been.

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:40.545
The one constant in our life is change.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.641
Thank you.

00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:44.394
(Applause)
