00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
doesn't mean it's not there."

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.160
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
What I wanted to do is to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
show the world that the little things

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
can be the biggest things.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
We all seem to think that,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.160
you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And we use the word "nothing."

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
My mother told me that, when I was a child,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.160
that I should always respect the little things.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
What made me do this work? I shall go into my story.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
This all started when I was age five.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
What made me do it? At school, I will admit this:

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
academically, I couldn't express myself.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
My world was seen as less.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
I thought, I need to retreat

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
into something else.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
So when my mother used to take me to school,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
she thought I was at school,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Now, the one time I was in the shed,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
and my mother suspected something,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
thinking I was at school.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
So you'd just see her feet.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
(Laughter)

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So I was hiding in the shed, like that.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And all of a sudden ...

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
And then I saw her legs.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big --

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
and she lifted me up and she says,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
"How come you're not at school?"

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
I told her I couldn't face it because the way

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
and using me as an example of failure.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
So I told her.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
but I told her I didn't feel right.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And walked off. And I didn't expect that,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
because I expected one of these ...

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
But I didn't get it.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
So I'm sitting there thinking.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
And as I looked down on the ground,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160
I noticed there was some ants running around.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
And I went into this little fantasy world.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And I thought,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Or do they need somewhere to live?"

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So I thought "Perhaps,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
if I made these ants some apartments,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
they'll move in."

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
(Laughter)

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
So I did.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
constructed this little apartment.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And so they did.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And then I sat down and all the ants came along.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
(Laughter)

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
(Laughter)

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
And from there I was watching this little world.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
It became part of me.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.160
When I discovered that I had this gift,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
I wanted to experiment with this world

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
that we can't see.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
So I realized that there was more to life

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.160
than just everything that we see around us that's huge.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
My mother told me to take it smaller.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Now I shall show you something here.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And I'll explain.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
As you can see,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
that's a pinhead.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
(Laughter)

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.160
(Applause)

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
Now that is called the Huf Haus.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
The gentleman who commissioned me to do this

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
was a gentleman called Peter Huf.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160
(Laughter)

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
(Laughter)

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
And then he said to me,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And I says, "Well, try me."

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.160
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
So, to cut a long story short,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
I went home, went underneath the microscope,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.160
and I crushed up a piece of glass,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
crushed it up.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And underneath the microscope

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
there were splinters of glass.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
Some of them were quite jagged.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
So I was crushing up these pieces of glass,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
which, as you can see,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
that's the actual frame of the house.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.160
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
(Laughter)

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
So I got the teddy bear and I said,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
So I did.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
So I decided to slice these up

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
with the tool that I make

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And then I actually

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
slow down my whole nervous system.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And then I work between my heartbeat,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
I have one-and-a-half seconds

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
to actually move.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
my own work, at the same time.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
(Laughter)

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.160
(Applause)

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Because that has happened to me.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160
(Laughter)

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
I found these little bits of glass.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
And I had to make them square.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And then I started rubbing, very very gently,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And how I constructed it,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
And as I was doing it, what happened?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.160
And it went like this ...

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
And then that was it.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160
(Laughter)

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Gone.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
when I told him his house has gone to another,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
into the atmosphere somewhere."

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
So to cut the story short,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
I decided that I had to go back and do it.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
construct it very, very slowly,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
holding my breath, working between my heartbeat,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
and making sure everything is leveled.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Because it's such a small sculpture,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
nothing can go wrong.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And I decided to build it up.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Then I used fibers out of my jumper,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
which I held and stretched.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
And made the beams going around the house.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
And the actual windows and the balcony

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
had to be sort of constructed.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
I used a money spider's web

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
to actually attach certain things,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
which sent me insane.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
But I managed to do it.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
And when I finished it, I came back the next day.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160
I noticed that the house was occupied.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Have we ever heard of a dust mite?

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Darren dust mite and his family moved in.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
(Laughter)

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
So basically I'd completed the house.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
And there you are.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:51.160
(Applause)

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
(Laughter)

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Right. As you can see,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Bart Simpson is having a little argument.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
There's not enough room for the two of them.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
I think he was just warning him actually.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
But this one was made out of a nylon tag

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
out of my shirt.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
What I did, I plucked the tag out

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
and put it underneath the microscope.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
Audience: No.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
WW: So what I did is the same process where I

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
just kind of hold my breath

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
and just work away very, very slowly,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Because it's on this molecular level things change

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
and they act different.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And, you know, all different things happen.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
to stop it moving.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
Then static electricity set in.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
And it went ...

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
So there is sweat dripping off my head,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.160
because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
And after I've cut out the shape,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
So after I've done the same thing,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
then I have to paint it.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
And after I've actually sculpted them,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
I have to paint them.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
I experimented with a --

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
I found a dead fly.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Decided to make a paintbrush.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.160
(Laughter)

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
But I would never do it to a living fly.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
(Laughter)

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Because I've heard a fly in pain.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
And they go "Meow! Ow!"

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
Even though they get on our nerves,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
I would never kill an insect

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
because, "All creatures great and small" --

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
there is a hymn that says that.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
So what I decided to do

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
is to pluck fine hair out of my face.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
That was the paintbrush.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
And it starts to dry very quickly.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
So I have to be very quick.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
If I'm not, it will end up looking

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
not like what it's supposed to look like.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
So I have to be very very careful.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.160
This one took me approximately,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
I would say, six to seven weeks.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
My work, rough estimate,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
sometimes five, six to seven weeks;

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
you can't always anticipate.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:11.160
(Applause)

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
As you can see,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:22.160
(Laughter)

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
He says to me, "Willard" --

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
You can see him saying, "Why me?"

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
That's just to show the scale

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
and the actual size of the sculpture.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.160
I would say it probably measures ...

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
a quarter of a millimeter.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
In America they say a period stop.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
So say if you cut a period stop in half,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.160
a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
which I took out of the air.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And what I normally do is walk 'round a room --

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
(Laughter) --

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
And she saw me walking around like this.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
(Laughter)

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
And then she looked at me.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And then I went ...

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Yeah, to actually do this thing --

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
the actual chariot is made of gold.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
I had a 24-karat gold ring.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
And I cut off a little flake of gold.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
And I bent it 'round,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
and made it into the chariot.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
And the horse is made from nylon.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
To get the symmetrical shape of the horse

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
was very difficult,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
because I had to get the horse to rear up

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
and look as though it was in some kind of action.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
When I did this one,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
a gentleman seen it and said to me,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
There's no way a man can do that.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
It must be a machine."

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160
So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.160
(Laughter)

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.160
(Applause)

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.160
That one took me approximately six weeks.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.160
(Applause)

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
The most famous statue in the world.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
This one, I would say,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
was a serious challenge.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:05.160
(Laughter)

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
Because I had to put the torch on the top.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
That one is, more or less, the same type of process.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.160
The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
I used a microscopic shard of diamond

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
to actually carve the actual base.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.160
Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
because that statue has always sort of

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
kept an image in my head of, you know,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.160
the beginning of people coming to America.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160
So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
And that's the first thing they saw.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
So I wanted to have that little image.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
And this is it.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.160
(Laughter)

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
And we all know that is the Hulk.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
Because we know we see needles,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
apart from putting a thread through it.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
So I broke the needle.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
And made a needle look like

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
the Hulk's broken it.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160
It's -- I had to make little holes

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160
in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
So most of my work, I don't use glue.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
They go in with their own friction.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
And that's how I managed to do it.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160
And his mouth must be probably about

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
three microns.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.160
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
That ship there,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
that's made from 24-karat gold.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
because I couldn't get the web to move off.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
Constructed each plank of gold.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.160
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:27.160
(Applause)

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.160
As you can see, dressage.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
(Laughter)

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
The actual rigging on the reins on the horse

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
are made from the same sort of thing.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.160
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.160
And the pinhead I've made green around there

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
by scraping the particles off a green shirt

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160
and then pressed onto the needle.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.160
It's very painstaking work,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160
but the best things come in small packages.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
(Laughter)

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan!

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.160
(Applause)
