00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.620
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.036
No one will ever pay you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.260
what you're worth.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.596
They'll only ever pay you

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.001
what they think you're worth.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.820
And you control their thinking,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.620
not like this,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.676
although that would be cool.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.316
(Laughter)

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.620
That would be really cool.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.460
Instead, like this:

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.956
clearly defining and communicating
your value are essential

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.860
to being paid well for your excellence.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.220
Anyone here want to be paid well?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.476
OK, good,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.980
then this talk is for everyone.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.796
It's got universal applicability.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.316
It's true if you're a business owner,
if you're an employee,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.796
if you're a job seeker.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.620
It's true if you're a man or a woman.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.956
Now, I approach this today through
the lens of the woman business owner,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.380
because in my work I've observed
that women underprice more so than men.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.556
The gender wage gap is
a well-traveled narrative in this country.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.676
According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.956
a woman employee earns just 83 cents
for every dollar a man earns.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.396
What may surprise you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.036
is that this trend continues
even into the entrepreneurial sphere.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.156
A woman business owner earns just
80 cents for every dollar a man earns.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.516
In my work, I've often heard women express

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.316
that they're uncomfortable
communicating their value,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.500
especially early on in business ownership.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.316
They say things like,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.020
"I don't like to toot my own horn."

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.900
"I'd rather let the work
speak for itself."

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.630
"I don't like to sing my own praises."

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.916
I hear very different narratives
in working with male business owners,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.140
and I think this difference
is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.916
I'd like to tell you the story
of a consulting firm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.156
that helps their clients
dramatically improve their profitability.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.580
That company is my company.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.876
After my first year in business,
I saw the profit increases

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.380
that my clients were realizing
in working with me,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.860
and I realized that I needed
to reevaluate my pricing.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.820
I was really underpriced
relative to the value I was delivering.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.660
It's hard for me to admit to you,
because I'm a pricing consultant.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.876
(Laughter)

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.116
It's what I do.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.940
I help companies price for value.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.596
But nonetheless, it's what I saw,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.500
and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing,
evaluate my value,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.140
and I did that
by asking key value questions.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.596
What are my clients' needs
and how do I meet them?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.460
What is my unique skill set that makes me
better qualified to serve my clients?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.180
What do I do that no one else does?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.636
What problems do I solve for clients?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.100
What value do I add?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.476
I answered these questions

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.116
and defined the value that my clients
get from working with me,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.996
calculated their return on investment,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.700
and what I saw was
that I needed to double my price,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.996
double it.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.460
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.860
I'm supposed to be the expert in this,
but I'm not cured.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.196
I knew the value was there.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.236
I was convinced the value was there,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.070
and I was still scared out of my wits.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.796
What if nobody would pay me that?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.076
What if clients said, "That's ridiculous.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.300
You're ridiculous."

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.500
Was I really worth that?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.580
Not my work, mind you, but me.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.660
Was I worth that?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.556
I'm the mother of two beautiful
little girls who depend upon me.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.076
I'm a single mom.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.700
What if my business fails?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.380
What if I fail?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.940
But I know how to take my own medicine,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.396
the medicine that I
prescribe to my clients.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.116
I had done the homework.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.580
I knew the value was there.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.020
So when prospects came,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.196
I prepared the proposals
with the new higher pricing

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.516
and sent them out

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.826
and communicated the value.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.500
How's the story end?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.636
Clients continued to hire me

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.020
and refer me and recommend me,
and I'm still here.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.116
And I share this story

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.580
because doubts and fears
are natural and normal.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.676
But they don't define our value,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.900
and they shouldn't limit
our earning potential.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.156
I'd like to share another story,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.996
about a woman who learned
to communicate her value

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.219
and found her own voice.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.156
She runs a successful
web development company

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.466
and employs several people.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.636
When she first started her firm
and for several years thereafter,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.620
she would say, "I have
a little web design company."

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.196
She'd actually use
those words with clients.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.020
"I have a little web design company."

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.996
In this and in many other small ways,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.916
she was diminishing her company
in the eyes of prospects and clients,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.180
and diminishing herself.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.900
It was really impacting her ability
to earn what she was worth.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.796
I believe her language and her style

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.076
communicated that she didn't believe

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.434
she had much value to offer.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.580
In her own words, she was practically
giving her services away.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.156
And so she began her journey

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.356
to take responsibility
for communicating value to clients

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.580
and changing her message.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.876
One thing I shared with her

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.956
is that it's so important

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.476
to find your own voice,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.556
a voice that's authentic and true to you.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.276
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law
just because she's a great salesperson

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.420
or your neighbor who tells a great joke
if that's not who you are.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.956
Give up this notion
that it's tooting your own horn.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.716
Make it about the other party.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.020
Focus on serving and adding value,
and it won't feel like bragging.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.876
What do you love about what you do?

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.996
What excites you
about the work that you do?

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.420
If you connect with that, communicating
your value will come naturally.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.596
So she embraced her natural style,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.780
found her voice and changed her message.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.916
For one thing, she stopped calling herself
a little web design company.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.780
She really found a lot of strength
and power in communicating her message.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.036
She's now charging three times
as much for web design,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.394
and her business is growing.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.356
She told me about a recent meeting

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.556
with a gruff and sometimes
difficult client

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.180
who had called a meeting questioning
progress on search engine optimization.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.516
She said in the old days,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.316
that would have been
a really intimidating meeting for her,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.796
but her mindset was different.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.516
She said, she prepared the information,
sat down with the client,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.316
said this isn't about me,
it's not personal,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.676
it's about the client.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.140
She took them through the data,
through the numbers,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.196
laid out the trends and the progress
in her own voice and in her own way,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.916
but very directly said,
"Here's what we've done for you."

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.780
The client sat up and took notice,
and said, "OK, I got it."

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.716
And she said in describing that meeting,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.580
"I didn't feel scared or panicky

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.580
or small,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.954
which is how I used to feel.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.140
Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.740
I know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'"

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.236
Being properly valued is so important.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.916
You can hear in this story

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.156
that the implications
range far beyond just finances

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.620
into the realm of self-respect
and self-confidence.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.716
Today I've told two stories,
one about defining our value

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.556
and the other about
communicating our value,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.356
and these are the two elements
to realizing our full earning potential.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.580
That's the equation.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.740
And if you're sitting
in the audience today

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.836
and you're not being paid
what you're worth,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.900
I'd like to welcome you
into this equation.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.796
Just imagine what life could be like,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.676
how much more we could do,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.796
how much more we could give back,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.356
how much more we could
plan for the future,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.580
how validated and respected we would feel

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.276
if we could earn our full potential,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.620
realize our full value.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.580
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.756
They'll only ever pay you
what they think you're worth,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.300
and you control their thinking.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.436
Thank you.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.780
(Applause)
