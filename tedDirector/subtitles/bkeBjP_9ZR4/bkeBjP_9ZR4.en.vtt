00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This technology

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
made a very important impact on us.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It changed the way our history developed.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
But it's a technology so pervasive,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
so invisible,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that we, for a long time,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
forgot to take it into account

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
when we talked about

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
human evolution.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
But we see the results of this technology, still.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
So let's make a little test.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Turn and face your neighbors.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Please, also on the balcony.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Smile, friendly.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
(Laughter)

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Do you --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Do you see any Canine teeth?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
(Laughter)

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Count Dracula teeth

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
in the mouths of your neighbors?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Of course not.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Because our dental anatomy

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
is actually made,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
not for tearing down raw meat from bones

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
or chewing fibrous leaves for hours.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
It is made for a diet

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
which is soft, mushy,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
which is reduced in fibers,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
which is very easily chewable

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and digestible.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
(Laughter)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It's for cooked food.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
We carry in our face the proof

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that cooking,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
food transformation,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
made us what we are.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
We talk about ourselves as omnivores.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors --

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
(Laughter)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
from coquere, to cook.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
We are the animals

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
who eat cooked food.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
No, no, no, no. Better --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
to live of cooked food.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So cooking is a very important technology.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It's technology.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I don't know how you feel,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
but I like to cook for entertainment.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And you need some design

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to be successful.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So, cooking is a very important technology,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because it allowed us to acquire

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
what brought you all here:

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
the big brain,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
this wonderful cerebral cortex we have.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Because brains are expensive.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Those have to pay tuition fees know.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
(Laughter)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
It's very expensive.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
If we eat raw food,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
we cannot release really the energy.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So this ingenuity of our ancestors,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
to invent this most marvelous technology.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Cooking made it possible

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
that mutations,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
natural selections, our environment,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
could develop us.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So if we think about

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
this unleashing human potential,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
which was possible by cooking and food,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
why do we talk so badly about food?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Why is it always do and don'ts

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and it's good for you, it's not good for you?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I think the good news for me

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
would be if we could go back

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and talk about the unleashing,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Now, cooking allowed also

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
that we became a migrant species.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
We walked out of Africa two times.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We populated all the ecologies.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
If you can cook, nothing can happen to you,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
because whatever you find,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
you will try to transform it.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It keeps also your brain working.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Now the very easy and simple technology

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
which was developed

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
actually runs after this formula.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Take something which looks like food, transform it,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
This technology affected two organs,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
But it shrunk to 60 percent

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
of primate gut

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
of my body mass.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So because of having cooked food,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
it's easier to digest.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now having a large brain, as you know,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
is a big advantage,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
because you can actually influence your environment.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
You can influence your own technologies you have invented.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
You can continue to innovate and invent.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
But how did it actually run this show?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
How did it actually interfere?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
What kind of criteria did it use?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And this is actually taste reward and energy.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
You know we have up to five tastes,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
three of them sustain us.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Sweet -- energy.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Umami -- this is a meaty taste.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
You need proteins for muscles, recovery.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Salty,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And two tastes which protect you --

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
bitter and sour,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
which are against

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
poisonous and rotten material.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
But of course, they are hard-wired

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
but we use them still in a sophisticated way.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Think about bittersweet chocolate;

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
or think about the acidity

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
of yogurt -- wonderful --

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
mixed with strawberry fruits.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
because we know

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that, in cooking, we can transform it

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
to the form.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Reward: this is a more complex

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and especially integrative

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
form of our brain

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
with various different elements --

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
the external states, our internal states,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
how do we feel, and so on are put together.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And something which maybe you don't like

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So satisfaction was a very important part.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And as I say, energy was necessary.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Now how did the gut actually

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
participate in this development?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And the gut is a silent voice --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
it's going more for feelings.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I use the euphemism digestive comfort --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
actually -- it's a digestive discomfort,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
which the gut is concerned with.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
or maybe other things went wrong.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So my story is a tale of two brains,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
because it might surprise you,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
our gut has a full-fledged brain.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
All the managers in the room say,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
This is what we are using."

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
(Laughter)

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And actually you use it and it's actually useful.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
they do speak with each other

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and make decisions.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
But what it means

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to have a brain there

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
is that, not only the big brain

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
has to talk with the food,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
the food has to talk with the brain,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
because we have to learn actually

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
how to talk to the brains.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Now if there's a gut brain,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
we should also learn to talk with this brain.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Now 150 years ago,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
anatomists described very, very carefully --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
here is a model of a wall of a gut.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
I took the three elements --

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
stomach, small intestine and colon.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And within this structure,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
you see these two pinkish layers,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
which are actually the muscle.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
a lot of nervous tissues,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
which penetrate actually the muscle --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
penetrate the submucosa,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
where you have all the elements for the immune system.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
The gut is actually the largest immune system,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
defending your body.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
It penetrates the mucosa.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and you digest,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
which is actually the lumen.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Now if you think about the gut,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
the gut is -- if you could stretch it --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
40 meters long,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
the length of a tennis court.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
If we could unroll it,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
get out all the folds and so on,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And now this brain takes care over this,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and, of course, digest our food we cook.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So if we give you a specification,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
this brain, which is autonomous,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
have 500 million nerve cells,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
100 million neurons --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
so around the size of a cat brain,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
so there sleeps a little cat --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
thinks for itself,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
optimizes whatever it digests.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It has 20 different neuron types.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
where you have 100 billion neurons.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
It has autonomous organized microcircuits,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
has these programs which run.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
It senses it by chemical means

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and very importantly by mechanical means,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
because it has to move the food --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
it has to mix all the various elements

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
which we need for digestion.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
This control of muscle is very, very important,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
because, you know, there can be reflexes.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
It's this brain which makes this reflex.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And then finally,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
which actually digests the food we cook.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Now how do the two brains work with each other?

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
I took here a model from robotics --

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
it's called the Subsumption Architecture.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
What it means is that we have a layered control system.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
The lower layer, our gut brain,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
has its own goals -- digestion defense --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and we have the higher brain

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
with the goal of integration

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and generating behaviors.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows --

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
both look to the same food, which is in the lumen

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and in the area of your intestine.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
The big brain integrates signals,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
which come from the running programs

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
of the lower brain,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
But subsumption means

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
It can replace,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
or it can inhibit actually, signals.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
So if we take two types of signals --

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
a hunger signal for example.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
If you have an empty stomach,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
It's a very big signal;

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
it's sent to the brain says,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
"Go and eat."

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
You have stop signals --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
we have up to eight stop signals.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
At least in my case,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
they are not listened to.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
(Laughter)

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
So what happens

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
if the big brain in the integration

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
overrides the signal?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
So if you override the hunger signal,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Despite generating

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
a healthy hunger signal,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
the big brain ignores it

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and activates different programs in the gut.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
The more usual case

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
is overeating.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
It actually takes the signal

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and changes it,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and we continue,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
We have transferred enough energy."

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Now the interesting thing is that,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
along this lower layer -- this gut --

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the signal becomes stronger and stronger

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
if undigested, but digestible, material

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
could penetrate.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
This we found from bariatric surgery.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
That then the signal would be very, very high.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
So now back to the cooking question

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and back to the design.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We have learned to talk to the big brain --

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
taste and reward, as you know.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Now what would be the language

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
we have to talk to the gut brain

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
that its signals are so strong

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that the big brain cannot ignore it?

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Then we would generate something

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
all of us would like to have --

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
a balance between the hunger

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and the satiation.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
This is fat digestion.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
You have on your left

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
an olive oil droplet,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
This is an in vitro experiment.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It's very difficult to work in the intestine.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Now everyone would expect

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
that when the degradation of the oil happens,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
when the constituents are liberated,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
they disappear, they go away

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
because they [were] absorbed.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And I hope you can see

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
which is water.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
This whole system generates a huge surface

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
to allow more enzymes

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to attack the remaining oil.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And finally, on your right side,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
you see a bubbly,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
cell-like structure appearing,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
from which the body will absorb the fat.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Now if we could take this language --

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and this is a language of structures --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and make it longer-lasting,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
that it can go through

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
the passage of the intestine,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
it would generate stronger signals.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
So our research --

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and I think the research also at the universities --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
are now fixing on these points

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to say: how can we actually --

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and this might sound trivial now to you --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
how can we change cooking?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
How can we cook

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
that we have this language developed?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
We have a coctivor's opportunity,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
because we have learned over the last two million years

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
which taste and reward --

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
quite sophisticated to cook --

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
If we add the matrix,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
if we add the structure language, which we have to learn,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
when we learn it, then we can put it back;

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
and around energy,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
we could generate a balance,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
which comes out

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
from our really primordial operation: cooking.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So, to make cooking really

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
a very important element,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
I would say even philosophers have to change

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and have to finally recognize

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
that cooking is what made us.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
So I would say, coquo ergo sum:

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
I cook, therefore I am.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
(Applause)
