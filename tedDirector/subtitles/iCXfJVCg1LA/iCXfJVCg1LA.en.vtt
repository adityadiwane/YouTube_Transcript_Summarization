00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:15.380
Dre Urhahn: This theater 
is built on Copacabana,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.483
which is the most famous 
beach in the world,

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.281
but 25 kilometers away from here

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.297
in the North Zone of Rio

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:25.359
lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.419
and roughly 60,000 people live there.

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.522
Now, the people here in Rio mostly know

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.397
Vila Cruzeiro from the news,

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:36.034
and unfortunately, news 
from Vila Cruzeiro often

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:38.466
is not good news.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.367
But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.392
where our story begins.

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:46.165
Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years 
ago, we first came to Rio

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.792
to shoot a documentary 
about life in the favelas.

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:52.694
Now, we learned that favelas 
are informal communities.

00:00:52.694 --> 00:00:53.911
They emerged over the years

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.771
when immigrants from the countryside

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:57.783
came to the cities looking for work,

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.029
like cities within the cities,

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.595
known for problems like crime, poverty,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.356
and the violent drug war between

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.768
police and the drug gangs.

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:09.013
So what struck us was that

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:10.570
these were communities that the people

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.050
who lived there had built 
with their own hands,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.600
without a master plan

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.500
and like a giant work in progress.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.374
Where we're from, in Holland,

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:21.457
everything is planned.

00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:24.121
We even have rules for 
how to follow the rules.

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.677
(Laughter)

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.795
DU: So the last day of 
filming, we ended up

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.944
in Vila Cruzeiro, and 
we were sitting down

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.332
and we had a drink,

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:33.007
and we were overlooking this hill

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:34.617
with all these houses,

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:36.952
and most of these houses looked unfinished,

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:38.382
and they had walls of bare brick,

00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:40.132
but we saw some of these houses

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:42.074
which were plastered and painted,

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.770
and suddenly we had this idea:

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.450
what would it look like if all these houses

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.625
would be plastered and painted?

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.667
And then we imagined one big design,

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.767
one big work of art.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.423
Who would expect something like that

00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:58.289
in a place like this?

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.452
So we thought, would that even be possible?

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:04.140
So first we started to count the houses,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.038
but we soon lost count.

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:09.234
But somehow the idea stuck.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:10.909
JK: We had a friend.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.520
He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.805
His name was Nanko,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:16.866
and he also liked the idea.

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.538
He said, "You know, everybody here

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.411
would pretty much love 
to have their houses

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.862
plastered and painted.

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:24.097
It's when a house is finished."

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:26.066
So he introduced us to the right people,

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.097
and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.

00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:32.014
We picked three houses in
the center of the community

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:34.494
and we start here. We made a few designs,

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:36.114
and everybody liked this design

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.527
of a boy flying a kite the best.

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.668
So we started painting, 
and the first thing we did

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:43.059
was to paint everything blue,

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.650
and we thought that looked 
already pretty good.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.181
But they hated it. The people
who lived there really hated it.

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.824
They said, "What did you do?

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:51.713
You painted our house in 
exactly the same color

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.513
as the police station."

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.426
(Laughter)

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:57.652
In a favela, that is not a good thing.

00:02:57.652 --> 00:03:01.477
Also the same color as the prison cell.

00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:04.931
So we quickly went ahead 
and we painted the boy,

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.139
and then we thought we were finished,

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.676
we were really happy, but still,

00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:11.069
it wasn't good because the little
kids started coming up to us,

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.131
and they said, "You know, 
there's a boy flying the kite,

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:15.178
but where is his kite?"

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:17.293
We said, "Uh, it's art.

00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:19.810
You know, you have to imagine the kite."

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.862
(Laughter)

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:24.526
And they said, "No, no, no, 
we want to see the kite."

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.423
So we quickly installed a kite

00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:27.788
way up high on the hill,

00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:29.920
so that you could see 
the boy flying the kite

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.333
and you could actually see a kite.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.188
So the local news started writing about it,

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:35.501
which was great,

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.088
and then even The Guardian wrote about it:

00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:41.264
"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:44.182
JK: So, encouraged by this success,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.710
we went back to Rio for a second project,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.336
and we stumbled upon this street.

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:53.609
It was covered in concrete 
to prevent mudslides,

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.960
and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.444
and we imagined this river
to be a river in Japanese style

00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:03.190
with koi carp swimming upstream.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.291
So we decided to paint that river,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.913
and we invited Rob Admiraal,

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.313
who is a tattoo artist,

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:12.333
and he specialized in the Japanese style.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.020
So little did we know that we would spend

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.455
almost an entire year painting that river,

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:21.175
together with Geovani
and Robinho and Vitor,

00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.301
who lived nearby.

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:25.371
And we even moved into the neighborhood

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:28.734
when one of the guys that 
lived on the street, Elias,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.659
told us that we could come 
and live in his house,

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.007
together with his family,

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.477
which was fantastic.

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:35.805
Unfortunately, during that time,

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.086
another war broke out between the police

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.861
and the drug gangs.

00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:44.609
(Video) (Gunfire)

00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:57.124
We learned that during those times,

00:04:57.124 --> 00:04:59.494
people in communities 
really stick together

00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:01.282
during these times of hardship,

00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:03.892
but we also learned a 
very important element,

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:07.199
the importance of barbecues. 
(Laughter)

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.920
Because, when you throw a barbecue,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.361
it turns you from a guest into a host,

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:12.574
so we decided to throw one

00:05:12.574 --> 00:05:13.797
almost every other week,

00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:16.806
and we got to know everybody 
in the neighborhood.

00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:18.831
JK: We still had this 
idea of the hill, though.

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:20.191
DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about

00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.137
the scale of this, because this painting

00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:24.398
was incredibly big,

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:26.546
and it was insanely detailed,

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:32.285
and this process almost drove
us completely insane ourselves.

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.480
But we figured that maybe, 
during this process,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.651
all the time that we had 
spent in the neighborhood

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.225
was maybe actually even more important

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:41.926
than the painting itself.

00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:43.444
JK: So after all that time,

00:05:43.444 --> 00:05:45.873
this hill, this idea was still there,

00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:48.258
and we started to make sketches,

00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:51.442
models, and we figured something out.

00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:53.545
We figured that our ideas, our designs

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:57.314
had to be a little bit more simple than that last project

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:59.458
so that we could paint with more people

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:03.114
and cover more houses at the same time.

00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:05.470
And we had an opportunity to try that out

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.040
in a community in the central part of Rio,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.788
which is called Santa Marta,

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:11.971
and we made a design for this place

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.362
which looked like this,

00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:14.907
and then we got people to go along with it

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:18.930
because turns out that if 
your idea is ridiculously big,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.500
it's easier to get people to 
go along with this. (Laughter)

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.468
And the people of Santa Marta

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.216
got together and in a little over a month

00:06:28.216 --> 00:06:30.589
they turned that square into this.

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:35.827
(Applause)

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:40.870
And this image somehow 
went all over the world.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.638
DU: So then we received 
an unexpected phone call

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:48.305
from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,

00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:49.880
and they had this question

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.781
if this idea, our approach,

00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:54.695
if this would actually 
work in North Philly,

00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.126
which is one of the poorest neighborhoods

00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:58.778
in the United States.

00:06:58.778 --> 00:07:01.838
So we immediately said yes.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.748
We had no idea how,

00:07:03.748 --> 00:07:06.169
but it seemed like a very 
interesting challenge,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.430
so we did exactly the 
same as we did in Rio,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.101
and we moved into the neighborhood

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.243
and started barbecuing.

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:17.102
(Laughter)

00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:20.871
So the project took almost two years to complete,

00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:22.761
and we made individual designs

00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:25.304
for every single house on 
the avenue that we painted,

00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:26.908
and we made these designs together

00:07:26.908 --> 00:07:29.521
with the local store owners, 
the building owners,

00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:34.459
and a team of about a dozen 
young men and women.

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:37.958
They were hired, and then
they were trained as painters,

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.523
and together they transformed
their own neighborhood,

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:46.340
the whole street, into a 
giant patchwork of color.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.680
(Applause)

00:07:52.142 --> 00:07:55.765
And at the end, the city of Philadelphia

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:57.778
thanked every single one of them

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.094
and gave them a merit for
their accomplishment.

00:08:01.094 --> 00:08:04.246
JK: So now we had painted a whole street.

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:07.801
How about we do this whole hill now?

00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:09.679
We started looking for funding,

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.920
but instead, we just ran into questions,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.339
like, how many houses 
are you going to paint?

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.495
How many square meters is that?

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:20.546
How much paint are you going to use,

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:23.189
and how many people are you going to employ?

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:25.900
And we did try for years to write plans

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.219
for the funding and answer 
all those questions,

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:30.759
but then we thought,

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.672
in order to answer all those questions,

00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:35.259
you have to know exactly 
what you're going to do

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:38.443
before you actually get there and start.

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:41.694
And maybe it's a mistake 
to think like that.

00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:44.222
It would lose some of the 
magic that we had learned

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:45.848
about that if you go somewhere

00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:48.263
and you spend time there,

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:50.231
you can let the project grow organically

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:53.719
and have a life of its own.

00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:55.931
DU: So what we did is

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:59.140
we decided to take this 
plan and strip it away

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.030
from all the numbers

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.999
and all the ideas and presumptions

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:05.362
and just go back to the base idea,

00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:07.364
which was to transform this hill

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:09.805
into a giant work of art.

00:09:09.805 --> 00:09:12.207
And instead of looking for funding,

00:09:12.207 --> 00:09:15.097
we started a crowdfunding campaign,

00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:16.680
and in a little over a month,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.852
more than 1,500 people put together

00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:22.127
and donated over 100,000 dollars.

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:25.730
So for us, this was an amazing 
moment, because now —

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.246
(Applause)&nbsp;—

00:09:29.246 --> 00:09:32.295
because now we finally had the freedom

00:09:32.295 --> 00:09:34.466
to use all the lessons that we had learned

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:37.562
and create a project that was built

00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:39.474
the same way that the favela was built,

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:41.128
from the ground on up, bottom up,

00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:43.703
with no master plan.

00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:46.800
JK: So we went back, 
and we employed Angelo,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.722
and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.518
very talented guy, and he
knows almost everybody there,

00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:53.940
and then we employed Elias, our former landlord

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.537
who invited us into his house,

00:09:55.537 --> 00:09:57.551
and he's a master of construction.

00:09:57.551 --> 00:09:59.992
Together with them, we decided where to start.

00:09:59.992 --> 00:10:01.678
We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,

00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:04.491
and houses are being plastered as we speak.

00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:06.071
And the good thing about them is that

00:10:06.071 --> 00:10:08.066
they are deciding which houses go next.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.752
They're even printing t-shirts,

00:10:09.752 --> 00:10:11.318
they're putting up banners

00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:13.302
explaining everything to everybody,

00:10:13.302 --> 00:10:15.143
and talking to the press.

00:10:15.143 --> 00:10:17.610
This article about Angelo appeared.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.788
DU: So while this is happening,

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:20.973
we are bringing this 
idea all over the world.

00:10:20.973 --> 00:10:24.290
So, like the project we 
did in Philadelphia,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.438
we are also invited to do workshops,

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:28.350
for instance in Curaçao,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.456
and right now we're planning 
a huge project in Haiti.

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:35.200
JK: So the favela was not only the place

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.787
where this idea started:

00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:40.342
it was also the place that made it possible

00:10:40.342 --> 00:10:43.468
to work without a master plan,

00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:45.538
because these communities are informal —

00:10:45.538 --> 00:10:46.977
this was the inspiration —

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:49.577
and in a communal effort, 
together with the people,

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:51.488
you can almost work like in an orchestra,

00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:53.062
where you can have a hundred instruments

00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:55.415
playing together to create a symphony.

00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:57.372
DU: So we want to thank everybody who

00:10:57.372 --> 00:10:58.990
wanted to become part of this dream

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.174
and supported us along the way,

00:11:01.174 --> 00:11:03.885
and we are looking at continuing.

00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:05.696
JK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:08.205
when the colors start 
going up on these walls,

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:10.184
we hope more people will join us,

00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:12.997
and join this big dream,

00:11:12.997 --> 00:11:15.617
and maybe one day, the 
whole of Vila Cruzeiro

00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:17.372
will be painted.

00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:19.284
DU: Thank you.

00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:22.545
(Applause)
