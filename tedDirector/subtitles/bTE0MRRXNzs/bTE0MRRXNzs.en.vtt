00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Now when we think of our senses,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
we don't usually think of the reasons

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
why they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We don't really think of the evolutionary need

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
to be protected by our senses,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but that's probably why our senses really evolved --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to keep us safe, to allow us to live.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Really when we think of our senses,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
or when we think of the loss of the sense,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
we really think about something more like this:

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
to smell something fragrant,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
to see something beautiful.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
This is what we want out of our senses.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
We want beauty; we don't just want function.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And when it comes to sensory restoration,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Likewise for hearing.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
When we think about why we hear,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
although clearly that's an important thing.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Really what we want to hear is music.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:27.260
(Music)

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Many of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
when he wrote that.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Now I'd like to impress upon you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
how unusual it is that we can hear music.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It's acoustic vibrations in the air,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Somehow in tickling our eardrum

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that transmits energy down our hearing bones,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that somehow wind up in our brains

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
That process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And we could discuss that topic alone for days

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
from something that starts out as a vibration in the air?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Turns out that if you have hearing loss,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
most people that lose their hearing

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
lose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Now if you had to pick a sense to lose,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I have to be very honest with you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and say, we're better at restoring hearing

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
than we are at restoring any sense that there is.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
In fact, nothing even actually comes close

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to our ability to restore hearing.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
that if you had to pick a sense to lose,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
As a musician, I can tell you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that if I had to have a cochlear implant,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
because I know that music would never sound the same to me.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Now this is a video that I'm going to show you

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
of a girl who's born deaf.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
She's in a very supportive environment.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Her mother's doing everything she can.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay, play that video please.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
(Video) Mother: That's an owl.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Owl, yeah.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Owl. Owl.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Yeah.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Baby. Baby.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
You want it?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
(Kiss)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Charles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
in terms of family support

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and simple infused learning,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
has in this world

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
has really evolved in the past 200 years.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
I mean literally,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and stick funnels in.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
So it's not too surprising

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that there were no good treatments for hearing loss.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
which is an outpatient procedure.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
It's surgically placed inside the inner ear.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
under general anesthesia.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And in the end, you achieve something like this

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Now actually, this is quite crude

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
in comparison to our regular inner ear.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But here is that same girl who is implanted now.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
This is her 10 years later.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And this is a video that was taken

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
by my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
If we could play this video please.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
JN: Well this book has seven chapters,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and the last chapter

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf."

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Do you remember writing that chapter?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
JN: Yeah.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
JN: I see. And who is that?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Girl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Mother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
JN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
(Laughter)

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It comes in handy.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
JN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Girl: No.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
CL: And so she's phenomenal.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
However, despite this incredible facility

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that some cochlear implant users display with language,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
In fact, most implant users really struggle

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and dislike music because it sounds so bad.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And so when it comes to this idea

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
of restoring beauty to somebody's life,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
we have a long way to go when it comes to audition.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
I mentioned earlier the fact

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that music is a different capacity because it's abstract.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Language is very different. Language is very precise.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
In fact, the whole reason we use it

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
is because it has semantic-specificity.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
When you say a word,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
what you care is that word was perceived correctly.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
You don't care that the word sounded pretty

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
when it was spoken.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Music is entirely different.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
When you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
There's really very little point in listening to music

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
when it doesn't sound good to you.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And you can see on this figure,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
that the frequency range

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
is far more heterogeneous.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
what we would try to do

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
is target it to be able to allow music transmission.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
If you can hear music,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
you should be able to hear anything.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And without the ability to perceive pitch well,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
music and melody is a very difficult thing to do --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
forget about a harmony and things like that.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Now if we could just play this.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:49.260
(Music)

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Okay, now if we consider

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that in a cochlear implant patient

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
let's see what happens here

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
when we randomize this to within one semitone.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Go ahead and play this one.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:29.260
(Music)

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Now my goal in showing you that

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.260
You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And it might be that you kind of like that.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
That's kind of hypnotic.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And you're not hearing the same thing

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that most people who have normal hearing are hearing.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Now the other issue comes with,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
not just the ability to tell pitches apart,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
but the ability to tell sounds apart.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
If we could play these two sound clips in succession.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
(Trumpet)

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
The trumpet.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And the second one.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.260
(Violin)

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
That's a violin.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
between these instruments.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
The sound quality, or the sound of the sound

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
is how I like to describe timbre, tone color --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
they cannot tell these things whatsoever.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
This implant is not transmitting

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and you have them listen to speech,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
what you find is that the auditory cortex

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
is the most active during speech.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
they were designed for speech.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But actually if you look at melody,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
what you find is that there's very little cortical activity

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So for whatever reason,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
during melody perception.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Now the next question is,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
well how does it really sound?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Now we've been doing some studies

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
I'm going to play you two clips of Usher,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
one which is normal

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and not even that many mid frequencies.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
Go ahead and play that.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.260
(Music)

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:24.260
(Limited Frequency Music)

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
I had patients tell me that those sound the same.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
between those two clips.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And yes, there is hope.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
This is ... does somebody know?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
This is Beethoven.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Because his grave was exhumed.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
to try to look at the cause of his deafness,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
which is why he has molding clay

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and his skull is bulging out on the side there.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
But Beethoven composed music

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
long after he lost his hearing.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
What that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
the capacity for music remains.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
The brains remain hardwired for music.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
where I've been working on deaf cats that are white

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:39.260
(Music)

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:55.260
(Music)

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
The "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:10.260
(Trumpet)

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
But she jumps to action when called to duty!

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
(Trumpet)

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
CL: Now I'm not suggesting

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
I'm suggesting that with training

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
you can imbue a musical sound with significance,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
even in a cat.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
If we were to direct efforts

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
towards training cochlear implant users to hear music --

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
no rehabilitative strategies,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
we would come a long way.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Now I want to show you one last video.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And this is of a student of mine named Joseph

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
He's deaf, and he learned to play the piano

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
after he received the cochlear implant.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And here's a video of Joseph.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:15.260
(Music)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And at about four months old,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Not long after,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I was fitted with hearing aids.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
But although these hearing aids

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
they weren't very helpful.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.260
So as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and I couldn't really hear what people were saying.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
When I was 12 years old,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
I was one of the first few people in Singapore

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
who underwent cochlear implantation.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And not long after I got my cochlear implant,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
I started learning how to play piano.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And it was absolutely wonderful.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Since then, I've never looked back.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
CL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
He is now a medical student at Yale University,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and he's contemplating a surgical career --

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And the fact that he can play the piano like that

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
is a testament to his brain.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
You don't actually have to hear it.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
I know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
(Laughter)

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And it's one of the most awful things --

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
heartwarming, but awful.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
(Laughter)

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And so there is certainly a lot of hope,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
but there's a lot more that needs to be done.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
So I just want to conclude with the following words.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
When it comes to restoration of hearing,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
we have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And we have a much longer way to go

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And let me tell you right now,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
But I tell you, if we lost our hearing,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
you would want perfect hearing back.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
You wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And I don't mean to understate

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
how important it is to restore basic function.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
where we can get inspiring.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And I don't think that we should give up on beauty.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
And I want to thank you for your time.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
(Applause)
