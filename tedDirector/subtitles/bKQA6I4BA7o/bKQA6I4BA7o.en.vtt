00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
because of the fact

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that we have what most people consider

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
an unusual friendship.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And it is.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And yet, it feels natural to us now.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I first learned

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that my son had been in the World Trade Center

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
We didn't know

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
if he had perished yet

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
until 36 hours later.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
At the time,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we knew that it was political.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
We were afraid of what our country was going to do

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
in the name of our son --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And when I saw it --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and yet, through the shock,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
the terrible shock,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
we were not vengeful.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And a couple of weeks later

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
for him, if convicted,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
my husband and I spoke out

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in opposition to that, publicly.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Through that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and through human rights groups,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
we were brought together

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
with several other victims' families.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
When I saw Aicha in the media,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
coming over when her son was indicted,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and I thought, "What a brave woman.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
I was still in deep grief;

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I knew I didn't have the strength.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I knew I would find her someday,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
or we would find each other.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I got immediate sympathy.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
But when people learned

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
what her son was accused of,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
she didn't get that sympathy.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But her suffering is equal to mine.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
So we met in November 2002,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and Aicha will now tell you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
how that came about.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.260
(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And I asked

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
the Organization of Human Rights

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So they introduced me

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
to five families.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
She was the only mother in the group.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
The others were brothers, sisters.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And I saw in her eyes

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that she was a mother, just like me.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I suffered a lot as a mother.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I was married when I was 14.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I lost a child when I was 15,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
a second child when I was 16.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And I still suffer,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
because my son

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
is like he's buried alive.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I know she really cried for her son.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
But she knows where he is.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
My son, I don't know where he is.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I don't know what happened to him.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So that's why I decided to tell my story,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
so that my suffering is something positive for other women.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
For all the women, all the mothers that give life,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
you can give back,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
you can change.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
It's up to us women,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
because we are women,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
because we love our children.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
We must be hand-in-hand

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and do something together.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
It's not against women,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it's for us, for us women,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
for our children.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
I talk against violence, against terrorism.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I go to schools

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
to talk to young, Muslim girls

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.260
so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So if I can save one of the young girls,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
well this is something good.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
This is why I'm here in front of you.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
PR: I would like to say

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
that I have learned so much from Aicha,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
starting with that day we had our very first meeting

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
with other family members --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
which was a very private meeting with security,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
because it was November 2002,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
those of us family members.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
But we were all so nervous.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
"Why does she want to meet us?"

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And then she was nervous.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
"Why did we want to meet her?"

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
What did we want from each other?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Before we knew each others' names, or anything,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
we had embraced and wept.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Then we sat in a circle

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
with support, with help,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And Aicha started,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and she said,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
"I don't know if my son

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
is guilty or innocent,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
but I want to tell you how sorry I am

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.260
for what happened to your families.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I know what it is to suffer,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and I feel that if there is a crime,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
a person should be tried fairly and punished."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But she reached out to us in that way,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And what happened then is we all told our stories,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and we all connected as human beings.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
By the end of the afternoon --

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.260
it was about three hours after lunch --

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Now what I learned from her,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is a woman, not only who could be so generous

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
under these present circumstances

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and what it was then,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and what was being done to her son,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
but the life she's had.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I never had met

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
someone with such a hard life,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.260
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And I feel

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that we have

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
a special connection,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
which I value very much.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And I think it's all about

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
being afraid of the other,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
but making that step

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Who else can I meet that I don't know,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
or that I'm so different from?"

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So, Aicha,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
do you have a couple of words

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
for conclusion?

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Because our time is up.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
(Laughter)

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
(Translator) AW: I wanted to say

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
that we have to try to know other people, the other.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
You have to be generous,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and your hearts must be generous,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
your mind must be generous.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
You must be tolerant.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
You have to fight against violence.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And I hope that someday we'll all live together

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
in peace and respecting each other.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
This is what I wanted to say.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:47.260
(Applause)
