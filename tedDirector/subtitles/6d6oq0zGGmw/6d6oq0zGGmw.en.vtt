00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:14.579
So I'm a neurosurgeon.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:17.649
And like most of my colleagues,

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.329
I have to deal, every day,
with human tragedies.

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:27.354
I realize how your life can change
from one second to the other

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:31.423
after a major stroke
or after a car accident.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.783
And what is very frustrating
for us neurosurgeons

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:40.427
is to realize that unlike
other organs of the body,

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:43.930
the brain has very little
ability for self-repair.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.125
And after a major injury
of your central nervous system,

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:54.125
the patients often remain
with a severe handicap.

00:00:55.203 --> 00:00:57.416
And that's probably
the reason why I've chosen

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.103
to be a functional neurosurgeon.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.052
What is a functional neurosurgeon?

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:08.338
It's a doctor who is trying to improve
a neurological function

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.679
through different surgical strategies.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.376
You've certainly heard of
one of the famous ones

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.486
called deep brain stimulation,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.362
where you implant an electrode
in the depths of the brain

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:24.962
in order to modulate a circuit of neurons

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:26.878
to improve a neurological function.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.396
It's really an amazing technology

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.787
in that it has improved
the destiny of patients

00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.633
with Parkinson's disease,

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.763
with severe tremor, with severe pain.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.456
However, neuromodulation
does not mean neuro-repair.

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.608
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:49.270
is to repair the brain.

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:52.619
I think

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:54.478
that we are approaching this dream.

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.135
And I would like to show you

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.096
that we are very close to this.

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:03.133
And that with a little bit of help,

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:06.524
the brain is able to help itself.

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:10.685
So the story started 15 years ago.

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.176
At that time, I was a chief resident

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.113
working days and nights
in the emergency room.

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.828
I often had to take care
of patients with head trauma.

00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:25.654
You have to imagine that when a patient
comes in with a severe head trauma,

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.977
his brain is swelling

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.981
and he's increasing
his intracranial pressure.

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.945
And in order to save his life,

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.777
you have to decrease
this intracranial pressure.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:37.952
And to do that,

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:41.896
you sometimes have to remove
a piece of swollen brain.

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:46.935
So instead of throwing away
these pieces of swollen brain,

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.448
we decided with Jean-François Brunet,

00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:51.385
who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.583
to study them.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.150
What do I mean by that?

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:59.207
We wanted to grow cells
from these pieces of tissue.

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:01.903
It's not an easy task.

00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:04.942
Growing cells from a piece of tissue

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:08.425
is a bit the same as growing
very small children

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.919
out from their family.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.006
So you need to find the right nutrients,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.799
the warmth, the humidity

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:19.059
and all the nice environments
to make them thrive.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.894
So that's exactly what we had
to do with these cells.

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:24.291
And after many attempts,

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.726
Jean-François did it.

00:03:27.372 --> 00:03:30.569
And that's what he saw
under his microscope.

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.039
And that was, for us, a major surprise.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:35.563
Why?

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:40.429
Because this looks exactly the same
as a stem cell culture,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:46.096
with large green cells
surrounding small, immature cells.

00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:50.422
And you may remember from biology class

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.957
that stem cells are immature cells,

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.860
able to turn into any type
of cell of the body.

00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:04.051
The adult brain has stem cells,
but they're very rare

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:08.454
and they're located
in deep and small niches

00:04:08.478 --> 00:04:10.495
in the depths of the brain.

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.221
So it was surprising to get
this kind of stem cell culture

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:16.604
from the superficial part
of swollen brain we had

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.245
in the operating theater.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.875
And there was another
intriguing observation:

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.116
Regular stem cells
are very active cells --

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.713
cells that divide, divide,
divide very quickly.

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.729
And they never die,
they're immortal cells.

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:35.798
But these cells behave differently.

00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:38.846
They divide slowly,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.870
and after a few weeks of culture,

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:42.456
they even died.

00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:46.973
So we were in front of a strange
new cell population

00:04:46.997 --> 00:04:50.091
that looked like stem cells
but behaved differently.

00:04:51.052 --> 00:04:55.496
And it took us a long time
to understand where they came from.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.065
They come from these cells.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.993
These blue and red cells are called
doublecortin-positive cells.

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:06.747
All of you have them in your brain.

00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:11.253
They represent four percent
of your cortical brain cells.

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:15.929
They have a very important role
during the development stage.

00:05:15.953 --> 00:05:17.708
When you were fetuses,

00:05:18.457 --> 00:05:21.129
they helped your brain to fold itself.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.635
But why do they stay in your head?

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:26.778
This, we don't know.

00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:30.636
We think that they may
participate in brain repair

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.124
because we find them
in higher concentration

00:05:34.148 --> 00:05:35.300
close to brain lesions.

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:36.942
But it's not so sure.

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:40.212
But there is one clear thing --

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.833
that from these cells,

00:05:41.857 --> 00:05:44.095
we got our stem cell culture.

00:05:45.363 --> 00:05:47.997
And we were in front
of a potential new source of cells

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:49.472
to repair the brain.

00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:51.561
And we had to prove this.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.736
So to prove it,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.608
we decided to design
an experimental paradigm.

00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:59.855
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.578
in a non-eloquent area of the brain,

00:06:02.602 --> 00:06:04.313
and then to culture the cells

00:06:04.337 --> 00:06:07.124
exactly the way Jean-François
did it in his lab.

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:10.043
And then label them, to put color in them

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.740
in order to be able
to track them in the brain.

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.424
And the last step was to re-implant them

00:06:15.448 --> 00:06:17.231
in the same individual.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.406
We call these

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.231
autologous grafts -- autografts.

00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:24.045
So the first question we had,

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.310
"What will happen if we re-implant
these cells in a normal brain,

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:32.192
and what will happen
if we re-implant the same cells

00:06:32.216 --> 00:06:33.439
in a lesioned brain?"

00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:36.852
Thanks to the help
of professor Eric Rouiller,

00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:38.542
we worked with monkeys.

00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:41.854
So in the first-case scenario,

00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:45.383
we re-implanted the cells
in the normal brain

00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:50.442
and what we saw is that they completely
disappeared after a few weeks,

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:53.420
as if they were taken from the brain,

00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:54.955
they go back home,

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.535
the space is already busy,

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:58.789
they are not needed there,
so they disappear.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.758
In the second-case scenario,

00:07:01.782 --> 00:07:03.013
we performed the lesion,

00:07:03.037 --> 00:07:06.177
we re-implanted exactly the same cells,

00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:10.274
and in this case, the cells remained --

00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:13.095
and they became mature neurons.

00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:17.611
And that's the image of what
we could observe under the microscope.

00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:20.189
Those are the cells
that were re-implanted.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.786
And the proof they carry,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.987
these little spots, those
are the cells that we've labeled

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:28.843
in vitro, when they were in culture.

00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:31.955
But we could not stop here, of course.

00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:37.158
Do these cells also help a monkey
to recover after a lesion?

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:42.664
So for that, we trained monkeys
to perform a manual dexterity task.

00:07:42.688 --> 00:07:45.706
They had to retrieve
food pellets from a tray.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.225
They were very good at it.

00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:51.368
And when they had reached
a plateau of performance,

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:57.687
we did a lesion in the motor cortex
corresponding to the hand motion.

00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.568
So the monkeys were plegic,

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:01.504
they could not move their hand anymore.

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:05.719
And exactly the same as humans would do,

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:08.669
they spontaneously recovered
to a certain extent,

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:10.713
exactly the same as after a stroke.

00:08:10.737 --> 00:08:12.524
Patients are completely plegic,

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:17.656
and then they try to recover
due to a brain plasticity mechanism,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.320
they recover to a certain extent,

00:08:19.344 --> 00:08:21.185
exactly the same for the monkey.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.653
So when we were sure that the monkey
had reached his plateau

00:08:24.677 --> 00:08:27.105
of spontaneous recovery,

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:29.704
we implanted his own cells.

00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:35.823
So on the left side, you see the monkey
that has spontaneously recovered.

00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:42.058
He's at about 40 to 50 percent
of his previous performance

00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:43.294
before the lesion.

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:46.849
He's not so accurate, not so quick.

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:50.835
And look now when we re-implant the cells:

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:55.112
Two months after re-implantation,
the same individual.

00:08:57.255 --> 00:09:04.173
(Applause)

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.325
It was also very exciting results
for us, I tell you.

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:13.027
Since that time, we've understood
much more about these cells.

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:15.971
We know that we can cryopreserve them,

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:17.857
we can use them later on.

00:09:18.214 --> 00:09:22.104
We know that we can apply them
in other neuropathological models,

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.097
like Parkinson's disease, for example.

00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:27.278
But our dream is still
to implant them in humans.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:32.219
And I really hope that I'll be able
to show you soon

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:38.599
that the human brain is giving us
the tools to repair itself.

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:39.943
Thank you.

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:45.953
(Applause)

00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:49.279
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,

00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:53.054
and I'm sure that right now, there are
several dozen people in the audience,

00:09:53.078 --> 00:09:54.284
possibly even a majority,

00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:57.056
who are thinking, "I know
somebody who can use this."

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.340
I do, in any case.

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:01.660
And of course the question is,

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.762
what are the biggest obstacles

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:06.577
before you can go
into human clinical trials?

00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:13.171
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest
obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.957
So, from these exciting results,
you need to fill out

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.218
about two kilograms of papers and forms

00:10:19.242 --> 00:10:22.290
to be able to go through these
kind of trials.

00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:24.946
BG: Which is understandable,
the brain is delicate, etc.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.328
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time

00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:31.383
and a lot of patience and almost
a professional team to do it, you know?

00:10:31.407 --> 00:10:33.673
BG: If you project yourself --

00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:34.912
having done the research

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:38.881
and having tried to get
permission to start the trials,

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.084
if you project yourself out in time,

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:46.434
how many years before
somebody gets into a hospital

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.631
and this therapy is available?

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:51.690
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:55.648
It depends, first,
on the approval of the trial.

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:58.775
Will the regulation allow us
to do it soon?

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:01.613
And then, you have to perform
this kind of study

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:04.437
in a small group of patients.

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:07.386
So it takes, already, a long time
to select the patients,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.316
do the treatment

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.069
and evaluate if it's useful
to do this kind of treatment.

00:11:13.093 --> 00:11:17.752
And then you have to deploy
this to a multicentric trial.

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:21.938
You have to really prove
first that it's useful

00:11:21.962 --> 00:11:24.843
before offering this treatment
up for everybody.

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:26.756
BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.574
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming
to TED and sharing this.

00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.749
BG: Thank you.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.444
(Applause)
