00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So I'm here to explain

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And to do that, I'd like to talk first

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
about environmental toxins in our bodies.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
So some of you may know

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that's found in the lining of canned foods

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and some plastics.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and causes neurological and reproductive problems.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And it's everywhere.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
A recent study found BPA

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
in 93 percent of people six and older.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
But it's just one chemical.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and this includes preservatives, pesticides

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and heavy metals like lead and mercury.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
To me, this says three things.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
First, don't become a cannibal.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
our own pollution.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And third,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
our bodies are filters and storehouses

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
for environmental toxins.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
The short answer is:

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
They return to the environment in one way or another,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
continuing the cycle of toxicity.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
But our current funeral practices

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
make the situation much worse.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
If you're cremated,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
from our dental fillings alone every year.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And in a traditional American funeral,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
to make it look alive.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
to slow decomposition --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
in funeral personnel.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
we deny death, poison the living

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and further harm the environment.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are a step in the right direction,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I think there's a better solution.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I'm an artist,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
so I'd like to offer a modest proposal

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
at the intersection

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
of art, science and culture.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
The Infinity Burial Project,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
an alternative burial system

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that uses mushrooms

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
The Infinity Burial Project

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
began a few years ago with a fantasy

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to create the Infinity Mushroom --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
a new hybrid mushroom

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and deliver nutrients to plant roots,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
leaving clean compost.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
But I learned it's nearly impossible

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
to create a new hybrid mushroom.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I also learned

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that some of our tastiest mushrooms

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
can clean environmental toxins in soil.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
So I thought maybe I could train an army

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
to eat my body.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
my hair, skin and nails --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
As the mushrooms grow,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I pick the best feeders

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to become Infinity Mushrooms.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
for the afterlife.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
So when I die,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and be able to eat it.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
All right, so for some of you,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
this may be really, really out there.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
(Laughter)

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Just a little.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I realize this is not the kind of relationship

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that we usually aspire to have with our food.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
But as I watch the mushrooms grow

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and digest my body,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I imagine the Infinity Mushroom

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and the relationship between my body and the environment.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
See for me,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
cultivating the Infinity Mushroom

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
is more than just scientific experimentation

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
or gardening or raising a pet,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
it's a step towards accepting the fact

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that someday I will die and decay.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
It's also a step

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
towards taking responsibility

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
for my own burden on the planet.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
of cultivating decomposing organisms

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
called decompiculture,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
a concept that was developed by an entomologist,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Timothy Myles.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the cultivation of organisms that decompose

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and clean toxins in bodies.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And now about these ninja pajamas.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Once it's completed,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
First, a burial suit

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
infused with mushroom spores,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
the Mushroom Death Suit.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
(Laughter)

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I'm wearing the second prototype

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
of this burial suit.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
It's covered with a crocheted netting

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that is embedded with mushroom spores.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
The dendritic pattern you see

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
which are the equivalent of plant roots.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I'm also making a decompiculture kit,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
a cocktail of capsules

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
that contain Infinity Mushroom spores

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and other elements

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
a kind of second skin,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
which dissolves quickly

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
in the next year or two,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and then I'd like to begin testing them,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
first with expired meat from the market

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and then with human subjects.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And believe it or not,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to be eaten by mushrooms.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
(Laughter)

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
What I've learned from talking to these folks

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
is that we share a common desire

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to understand and accept death

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I wanted to cultivate this perspective

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
just like the mushrooms,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
so I formed the Decompiculture Society,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
a group of people called decompinauts

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
who actively explore their postmortem options,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
seek death acceptance

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and cultivate decomposing organisms

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
like the Infinity Mushroom.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of a cultural shift,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
from our current culture of death denial and body preservation

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
to one of decompiculture,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Accepting death means accepting

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that we are physical beings

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
who are intimately connected to the environment,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
as the research on environmental toxins confirms.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And the saying goes,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
we came from dust and will return to dust.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And once we understand that we're connected to the environment,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
we see that the survival of our species

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
depends on the survival of the planet.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I believe this is the beginning

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
of true environmental responsibility.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Thank you.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.260
(Applause)
