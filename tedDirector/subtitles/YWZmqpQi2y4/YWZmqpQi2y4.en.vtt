00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
this idea that there is a narrative line,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and that music exists in time.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
A film also exists in time; it's an experience

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
that you should go through emotionally.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
were all about learning something,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
and really to follow my journey.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
and we meet people along the way.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
We only meet them once.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It's something like life, that once you get in it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
you can't get out.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
There are two clips I want to show you,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
the first one is a kind of hodgepodge,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
its just three little moments, four little moments

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
with three of the people who are here tonight.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
It's not the way they occur in the film,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
because they are part of much larger scenes.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
They play off each other in a wonderful way.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
talking about something that is very dear to him,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
which is the accidents of life.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
and perhaps not planned at all.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
And those three clips will be followed by a scene of

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
He built the capital over there.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen --

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
We were the first film crew in there.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
it was built entirely by hand,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
I think they got a crane the last year.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
dumping them in the forms.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
It is the capital of the country,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and it took 23 years to build,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
It took as long as the Taj Mahal.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
He died in 1974.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
The building was finished in 1983.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
So it continued on for many years

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
after he died.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Think about that when you see that building,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
And that really struck me about my father,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
in the sense that he had such belief

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
that somehow, doing these things

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
and the construction stopped totally and he kept working,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
because he felt, "Well when the war is done

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
they'll need this building."

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Roll that tape.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.160
(Applause)

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And I came home and I said to my father and mother,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and he's sort of ugly, funny voice,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
and he's a teacher at school.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
that someday you will hear of him,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
because he's really an amazing man."

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Frank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
(Laughter)

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160
NK: Did you hear that, really?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.160
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
it was so consistent with his life, you know?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
or I'm going to die in an airport,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
or die jogging without an identification on me.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I don't know why I sort of carry that

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
from that memory of the way he died.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
But he was a sort of a nomad at heart.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and how full of influence by circumstance.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160
and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
We are proud of it.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
NK: You're proud of it?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
NK: Do you know anything about the architect?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
he was my father.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Man: Louis Kahn, yes!

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
(Laughter)

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Man: Your father, is he alive?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Man: Very pleased to welcome you back.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160
NK: Thank you.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
No, he never saw this.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
Shamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and since we invited him here,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
he felt that he has got a responsibility.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
He is not a political man,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
but in this guise he has given us

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
the institution for democracy, from where we can rise.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.160
In that way it is so relevant.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
He didn't care for how much money this country has,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
or whether he would be able to ever finish this building,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.160
And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
NK: It cost him his life.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
SW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
and that is why he is great and we'll remember him.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
But he was also human.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Now his failure to satisfy the family life,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
is an inevitable association of great people.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
But I think his son will understand this,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
and will have no sense of grudge,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
or sense of being neglected, I think.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
He cared in a very different manner,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
but it takes a lot of time to understand that.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.160
In social aspect of his life

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
He could not say no to anything,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
and that is why, that he cannot say no to things,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
we got this building today.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
You see, only that way you can be able to understand him.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
There is no other shortcut,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
no other way to really understand him.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:40.160
But I think he has given us this building

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and we feel all the time for him,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
that's why, he has given love for us.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
He could not probably give the right kind of love for you,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
that is important.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
You have to understand that.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
He had an enormous amount of love,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
he loved everybody.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
To love everybody, he sometimes did not see

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
the very closest ones,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and that is inevitable for men of his stature.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:22.160
(Applause)
