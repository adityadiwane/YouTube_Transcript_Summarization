00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.239
The maxim, "Know thyself"
has been around since the ancient Greeks.

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:24.464
Some attribute this golden world
knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:27.664
But the truth is it doesn't really matter
which sage said it first,

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.475
because it's still
sage advice, even today.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.491
"Know thyself."

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:37.445
It's pithy almost to the point
of being meaningless,

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.004
but it rings familiar
and true, doesn't it?

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:42.465
"Know thyself."

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.409
I understand this timeless dictum
as a statement about the problems,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.235
or more exactly, the confusions,
of consciousness.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.072
I've always been fascinated
with knowing the self.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.603
This fascination led me
to submerge myself in art,

00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:59.084
study neuroscience,
and later, to become a psychotherapist.

00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:02.784
Today I combine all my passions
as the CEO of InteraXon,

00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:04.853
a thought-controlled computing company.

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:10.235
My goal, quite simply, is to help people
become more in tune with themselves.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.662
I take it from this
little dictum, "Know thyself."

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:15.867
If you think about it,

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.435
this imperative is kind of the defining
characteristic of our species, isn't it?

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:22.760
I mean, it's self-awareness

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:26.400
that separates Homo sapiens
from earlier instances of our mankind.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.988
Today we're often too busy

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:34.793
tending to our iPhones and iPods
to really stop and get to know ourselves.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.824
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute
text conversations,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.908
e-mails, relentless exchange
of media channels

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:43.733
and passwords and apps
and reminders and Tweets and tags,

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:47.483
we lose sight of what all this fuss is
supposed to be about in the first place:

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.122
Ourselves.

00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:51.198
Much of the time we're transfixed

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:54.514
by all of the ways we can reflect
ourselves out into the world.

00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:59.719
And we can barely find the time to reflect
deeply back in on our own selves.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.375
We've cluttered ourselves up
with all this.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.830
And we feel like we have to get
far, far away to a secluded retreat,

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.304
leaving it all behind.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:11.436
So we go far away
to the top of a mountain,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.490
assuming that perching
ourselves on a piece

00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:18.003
is bound to give us the respite we need
to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:19.701
and find ourselves again.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:24.883
But on that mountain where we gain
that beautiful peace of mind,

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:26.964
what are we really achieving?

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:30.672
It's really only a successful escape.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.548
Think of the term we use, "Retreat."

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:36.393
This is the term that armies use
when they've lost a battle.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.246
It means we've got to get out of here.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.765
Is this how we feel
about the pressures of our world,

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.783
that in order to get inside ourselves,

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.236
you have to run for the hills?

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:48.091
And the problem with escaping
your day-to-day life

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:50.530
is that you have to come home, eventually.

00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.164
So when you think about it,

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:57.642
we're almost like a tourist
visiting ourselves over there.

00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:00.235
And eventually, that vacation's got
to come to an end.

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:03.584
So my question to you is,

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:07.687
can we find ways to know ourselves
without the escape?

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.002
Can we redefine our relationship
with the technologized world

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.674
in order to have the heightened
sense of self-awareness that we seek?

00:03:15.698 --> 00:03:19.174
Can we live here and now in our wired web

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:23.720
and still follow those ancient
instructions, "Know thyself?"

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.926
I say the answer is yes.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.996
And I'm here today to share a new way

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.430
that we're working
with technology to this end,

00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:34.909
to get familiar with our inner self
like never before --

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:39.426
humanizing technology
and furthering that age-old quest of ours

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.988
to more fully know the self.

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:45.260
It's called thought-controlled computing.

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:49.608
You may or may not have noticed

00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:51.941
that I'm wearing a tiny
electrode on my forehead.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.636
This is actually a brainwave sensor

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.016
that's reading the electrical
activity of my brain

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.236
as I give this talk.

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.241
These brainwaves are being analyzed
and we can see them as a graph.

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:03.236
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:06.738
That blue line there is my brainwave.

00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:10.897
It's the direct signal being recorded
from my head, rendered in real time.

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.332
The green and red bars show
that same signal displayed by frequency,

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:16.070
with lower frequencies here

00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:17.797
and higher frequencies up here.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.409
You're actually looking
inside my head as I speak.

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:25.965
These graphs are compelling,
they're undulating,

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:29.235
but from a human's perspective,
they're actually not very useful.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.046
That's why we've spent a lot of time

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.847
thinking about how to make this data
meaningful to the people who use it.

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:37.385
For instance,

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.364
what if I could use this data to find out
how relaxed I am at any moment?

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:43.209
Or what if I can take that information

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:46.215
and put it into an organic
shape up on the screen?

00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:48.773
The shape on the right over here

00:04:48.797 --> 00:04:51.474
has become an indicator
of what's going on in my head.

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:52.992
The more relaxed I am,

00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:55.478
the more the energy's going
to fall through it.

00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:58.356
I may also be interested in knowing
how focused I am,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.138
so I can put my level of attention
into the circuit board on the other side.

00:05:02.162 --> 00:05:03.777
And the more focused my brain is,

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.682
the more the circuit board
is going to surge with energy.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.130
Ordinarily, I would have no way
of knowing how focused or relaxed I was

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:11.893
in any tangible way.

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:15.115
As we know, our feelings
about how we're feeling

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.968
are notoriously unreliable.

00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:19.825
We've all had stress creep up
on us without even noticing it

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.265
until we lost it on someone
who didn't deserve it,

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.863
and then we realize that we probably
should have checked in with ourselves

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:27.040
a little earlier.

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:30.182
This new awareness
opens up vast possibilities

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:33.236
for applications that help
improve our lives and ourselves.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.144
We're trying to create technology
that uses the insights

00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:39.851
to make our work more efficient,
our breaks more relaxing

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.875
and our connections deeper
and more fulfilling than ever.

00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:46.624
I'm going to share some of these
visions with you in a bit,

00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:49.236
but first I want to take
a look at how we got here.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.236
By the way, feel free to check
in on my head at any time.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.705
(Laughter)

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.236
My team at InteraXon and I

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.049
have been developing thought-controlled
application for almost a decade now.

00:06:00.073 --> 00:06:01.693
In the first phase of development,

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:05.153
we were really enthused by all the things
we could control with our mind.

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:09.451
We were making things activate,
light up and work just by thinking.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.615
We were transcending the space
between the mind and the device.

00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:17.009
We brought to life a vast array
of prototypes and products

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:19.054
that you could control with your mind,

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.994
like thought-controlled home appliances

00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:24.734
or slot-car games or video games
or a levitating chair.

00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:29.133
We created technology and applications
that engaged people's imaginations,

00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:30.618
and it was really exciting.

00:06:30.642 --> 00:06:34.474
And then we were asked to do something
really big for the Olympics.

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.362
We were invited to create
a massive installation

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:39.224
at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:40.779
were used in Vancouver,

00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:43.520
got to control the lighting
on the CN Tower,

00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:46.459
the Canadian Parliament
buildings and Niagara Falls

00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:50.235
from all the way across the country
using their minds.

00:06:50.564 --> 00:06:53.783
Over 17 days at the Olympics,
7,000 visitors from all over the world

00:06:53.807 --> 00:06:55.972
actually got to individually
control the light

00:06:55.996 --> 00:06:58.627
from the CN Tower, parliament
and Niagara in real time

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:01.672
with their minds from across
the country, 3,000 km away.

00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:05.235
So controlling stuff
with your mind is pretty cool.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.532
But we're always interested in multitiered
levels of human interaction.

00:07:09.556 --> 00:07:12.957
And so we began looking into inventing
thought-controlled applications

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.252
in a more complex frame than just control.

00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:18.236
And that was responsiveness.

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.572
We realized that we had a system

00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:23.202
that allowed technology
to know something about you.

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.861
And it could join
into the relationship with you.

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.709
We created the responsive room

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:31.725
where the lights, music and blinds
adjusted to your state.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.103
They followed these little shifts
in your mental activity.

00:07:35.127 --> 00:07:37.921
So as you settled into relaxation
at the end of a hard day,

00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:39.276
on the couch in our office,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.456
the music would mellow with you.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.086
When you read, the desk lamp
would get brighter.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.625
If you nod off, the system would know,
dimming to darkness as you do.

00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:53.560
We then realized that if technology
could know something about you

00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:54.790
and use it to help you,

00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:57.634
there's an even more valuable
application than that.

00:07:57.658 --> 00:08:00.729
That you could know
something about yourself.

00:08:01.484 --> 00:08:04.662
We could know sides of ourselves
that were all but invisible

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:07.235
and come to see things
that were previously hidden.

00:08:08.093 --> 00:08:10.839
Let me show you an example
of what I'm talking about here.

00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:13.406
Here's an application
that I created for the iPad.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.669
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound
is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.

00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:20.237
So you use it with your headset.

00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:23.117
The headset connects wirelessly
to an iPad or a smartphone.

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:27.788
In that headset, you have fabric sensors
on your forehead and above the ear.

00:08:27.812 --> 00:08:29.334
In the original Zen Bound game,

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:32.236
you play it by scrolling
your fingers over the pad.

00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:34.686
In the game that we created, of course,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.862
you control the wooden form
that's on the screen there with your mind.

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.485
As you focus on the wooden form,

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:42.704
it rotates.

00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:45.761
The more you focus,
the faster the rotation.

00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:47.768
This is for real.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:49.236
This is not a fake.

00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:51.698
What's really interesting to me though

00:08:51.722 --> 00:08:55.592
is at the end of the game, you get stats
and feedback about how you did.

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:59.705
You have graphs and charts
that tell you how your brain was doing --

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:02.781
not just how much rope you used
or what your high score is,

00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:06.653
but what was going on inside of your mind.

00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:08.927
And this is valuable feedback

00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:13.470
that we can use to understand
what's going on inside of ourselves.

00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:18.488
I like to call this "intra-active."

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.551
Normally, we think
about technology as interactive.

00:09:23.051 --> 00:09:25.762
This technology is intra-active.

00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:30.411
It understands what's inside of you

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:32.800
and builds a sort
of responsive relationship

00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:34.821
between you and your technology

00:09:34.845 --> 00:09:38.800
so that you can use this information
to move you forward.

00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:43.694
So you can use this information
to understand you in a responsive loop.

00:09:44.154 --> 00:09:45.907
At InteraXon --

00:09:47.672 --> 00:09:53.246
intra-active technology
is one of our really defining mandates.

00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:58.828
It's how we understand the world inside
and reflect it outside

00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.895
into this tight loop.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:05.054
For example, thought-controlled computing

00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:08.235
can teach children with ADD
how to improve their focus.

00:10:08.686 --> 00:10:13.001
With ADD, children have a low proportion
of beta waves for focus states

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:15.058
and a high proportion of theta states.

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:18.268
So you can create applications
that reward focused brain states.

00:10:18.292 --> 00:10:21.497
So you can imagine kids playing
video games with their brain waves

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:23.990
and improving their ADD
symptoms as they do it.

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:25.908
This can be as effective as Ritalin.

00:10:26.845 --> 00:10:28.686
Perhaps even more importantly,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.287
thought-controlled computing
can give children with ADD

00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:34.214
insights into their own fluctuating
mental states,

00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:37.870
so they can better understand themselves
and their learning needs.

00:10:37.894 --> 00:10:41.870
The way these children will be able to use
their new awareness to improve themselves

00:10:41.894 --> 00:10:44.818
will upend many of the damaging
and widespread social stigmas

00:10:44.842 --> 00:10:48.682
that people who are diagnosed
as different are challenged with.

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:50.530
We can peer inside our heads

00:10:50.554 --> 00:10:53.337
and interact with what was once
locked away from us,

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.259
what once mystified and separated us.

00:10:57.602 --> 00:11:00.892
Brainwave technology can understand us,
anticipate our emotions

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:02.929
and find the best solutions for our needs.

00:11:02.953 --> 00:11:05.699
Imagine this collected
awareness of the individual

00:11:05.723 --> 00:11:08.235
computed and reflected
across an entire lifespan.

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:12.235
Imagine the insights that you can gain
from this kind of second sight.

00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:15.686
It would be like plugging
into your own personal Google.

00:11:16.056 --> 00:11:17.306
On the subject of Google,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.236
today you can search and tag images

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.632
based on the thoughts and feelings
you had while you watched them.

00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:25.400
You can tag pictures
of baby animals as happy,

00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:27.894
or whatever baby animals are to you,

00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:31.738
and then you can search that database,
navigating with your feelings,

00:11:31.762 --> 00:11:34.236
rather than the keywords
that just hint at them.

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:37.088
Or you could tag Facebook photos

00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:41.704
with the emotions that you had
associated with those memories

00:11:41.728 --> 00:11:45.430
and then instantly prioritize
the streams that catch your attention,

00:11:46.154 --> 00:11:47.383
just like this.

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:51.793
Humanizing technology
is about taking what's already natural

00:11:51.817 --> 00:11:53.417
about the human-tech experience

00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:56.827
and building technology
seamlessly in tandem with it.

00:11:56.851 --> 00:11:59.160
As it aligns with our human behaviors,

00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:02.360
it can allow us to make
better sense of what we do

00:12:02.384 --> 00:12:04.619
and, more importantly, why.

00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:08.236
Creating a big picture
out of all the important little details

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.510
that make up who we are.

00:12:11.174 --> 00:12:14.722
With humanized technology we can monitor
the quality of your sleep cycles.

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:19.515
When our productivity starts to slacken,
we can go back to that data

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:23.487
and see how we can make more effective
balance between work and play.

00:12:24.192 --> 00:12:28.125
Do you know what causes fatigue in you
or what brings out your energetic self,

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:30.067
what triggers cause you to be depressed

00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:33.609
or what fun things are going
to bring you out of that funk?

00:12:35.017 --> 00:12:36.663
Imagine if you had access to data

00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.884
that allowed you to rank
on a scale of overall happiness

00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:42.764
which people in your life
made you the happiest,

00:12:43.487 --> 00:12:45.883
or what activities brought you joy.

00:12:45.907 --> 00:12:48.962
Would you make more time for those people?
Would you prioritize?

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.261
Would you get a divorce?

00:12:50.285 --> 00:12:51.670
(Laughter)

00:12:51.694 --> 00:12:54.183
What thought-controlled computing
can allow you to do

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:56.999
is build colorful layered
pictures of our lives.

00:12:57.023 --> 00:13:00.509
And with this, we can get the skinny
on our psychological happenings

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.941
and build a story
of our behaviors over time.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:06.598
We can begin to see the underlying
narratives that propel us forward

00:13:06.622 --> 00:13:09.211
and tell us about what's going on.

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:14.561
And from this, we can learn
how to change the plot, the outcome

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.571
and the character of our personal stories.

00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:22.967
Two millennia ago, those Greeks
had some powerful insights.

00:13:23.682 --> 00:13:26.102
They knew that a fundamental
piece falls into place

00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:28.865
when you start to live
out their little phrase,

00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:31.236
when you come into contact with yourself.

00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:35.032
They understood the power
of human narrative

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:39.052
and the value that we place on humans
as changing, evolving and growing.

00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:42.236
But they understood something
more fundamental --

00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:45.236
the sheer joy in discovery,

00:13:46.366 --> 00:13:48.895
the delight and fascination
that we get from the world

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:50.495
and being ourselves in it;

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:55.911
the richness that we get from seeing,
feeling and knowing the lives that we are.

00:13:56.787 --> 00:13:57.954
My mom's an artist,

00:13:57.978 --> 00:14:01.836
and as a child, I'd often see her bring
things to life with the stroke of a brush.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.468
One moment, it was
all white space, pure possibility.

00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:07.988
The next, it was alive
with her colorful ideas and expressions.

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:13.562
As I sat easel-side, watching her
transform canvas after canvas,

00:14:14.413 --> 00:14:16.978
I learned that you could
create your own world.

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:20.297
I learned that our own inner worlds --

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.461
our ideas, emotions and imaginations --

00:14:23.485 --> 00:14:26.236
were, in fact, not bound
by our brains and bodies.

00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:30.111
If you could think it,
if you could discover it,

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.848
you could bring it to life.

00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:35.236
To me, thought-controlled computing

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.663
is as simple and powerful
as a paintbrush --

00:14:37.687 --> 00:14:41.235
one more tool to unlock and enliven
the hidden worlds within us.

00:14:42.223 --> 00:14:46.492
I look forward to the day
that I can sit beside you, easel-side,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.165
watching the world that we can create
with our new toolboxes

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:54.235
and the discoveries
that we can make about ourselves.

00:14:55.752 --> 00:14:56.959
Thank you.

00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:58.783
(Applause)
