Conficker fitters,

(Applause)

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:08.033
Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever
since I could hold a crayon,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.116
and I've been making animated flip books

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:12.056
since I was three years old.

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:15.250
At that age, I also learned
about what an animator was.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.583
There was a program on TV about jobs

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:19.345
most kids don't know about.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.101
When I understood that an animator

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.933
makes the cartoons I saw on TV,

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:26.714
I immediately said, "That's what I want to be."

00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:29.016
I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:32.900
but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.227
Animation and art has always been my first love.

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:39.350
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.216
for "Malicious Dishes."

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:42.955
There was a virus on my computer,

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:44.602
and I was trying to get rid of it,

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:46.478
and all of a sudden, I just thought,

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:49.418
what if viruses have their own
little world inside the computer?

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:51.537
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.130
and do virusy things?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.502
And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:58.645
At four years old, my dad showed me

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:01.513
how to take apart a computer
and put it back together again.

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.123
That started my love for technology.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:07.154
I built my first website myself in HTML,

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.671
and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.410
I'm also working on an animated series

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.665
called "The Pollinators."

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.881
It's about bees and other
pollinators in our environment

00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:17.250
and why they're so important.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.860
If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.769
then all creatures, including ourselves,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.285
that depend on these plants, would starve.

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:26.493
So I decided to take these cool creatures

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:30.312
and make a superhero team.

00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:34.867
(Applause)

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:41.376
(Foot stomp)

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:45.517
(Music)

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:50.154
(Roar)

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.631
Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.049
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.820
(Music)

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.524
Thank you. (Applause)

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:12.602
All of my animations start with ideas,

00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:16.337
but what are ideas?

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:19.340
Ideas can spark a movement.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.009
Ideas are opportunities and innovation.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.628
Ideas truly are what make the world go round.

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:29.055
If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.038
where we are now with technology, medicine,

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:35.125
art, culture, and how we even live our lives.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.387
At eight years old, I took my ideas

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:40.331
and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,

00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.107
and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:44.853
(Laughter)

00:03:44.853 --> 00:03:48.304
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.974
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business

00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:52.386
in 2008,

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.696
my artistic journey started way before then.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:57.986
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:01.006
incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.009
I would find different fabrics around the house,

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.264
and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot;

00:04:05.264 --> 00:04:08.374
and I had all these ideas for designs.

00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:10.227
I noticed when I wore my creations,

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:11.675
people would stop me and say,

00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:13.732
"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.915
And I thought, I can start my own business.

00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:18.789
Now I didn't have any business plans

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.557
at only eight years old.

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:22.584
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations

00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:23.839
that were safe for the environment

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.877
and I wanted to give back.

00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:27.700
My mom taught me how to sew,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.697
and on my back porch, I would sit and make

00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:31.218
little headbands out of ribbon,

00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:33.818
and I would write down the names
and the price of each item.

00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:35.888
I started making more items like hats,

00:04:35.888 --> 00:04:38.094
scarves and bags.

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.489
Soon, my items began selling all over the world,

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.318
and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:45.925
Canada and more.

00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:48.509
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.184
like branding and marketing,

00:04:50.184 --> 00:04:51.942
staying engaged with my customers,

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:55.423
and seeing what sold the most and the least.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.837
Soon, my business really started to take off.

00:04:57.837 --> 00:05:02.084
Then one day, Forbes magazine 
contacted me when I was 10 years old.

00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:03.677
(Laughter)

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:06.014
They wanted to feature me and my company

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.036
in their article.

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.117
Now a lot of people ask me,

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:12.543
why is your business eco-friendly?

00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:15.067
I've had a passion for protecting the environment

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:17.108
and its creatures since I was little.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.025
My parents taught me at an early age

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:22.319
about giving back and being a
good steward to the environment.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.385
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:26.531
or the process of even making the items

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.110
was harmful to the people and the planet,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.259
so I started doing my own research,

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.364
and I discovered that even
after dyeing has being completed,

00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:36.390
there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.004
on the environment.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.987
For example, the grinding of materials,

00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:42.718
or the dumping of dried powder materials.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.418
These actions can pollute the air,

00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:48.181
making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.645
So when I started my business,

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:52.001
I knew two things:

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.713
All of my items had to be eco-friendly,

00:05:54.713 --> 00:05:56.982
and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:58.642
went to local and global charities

00:05:58.642 --> 00:06:00.719
and environmental organizations.

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.587
(Applause)

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:07.136
I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:09.398
that not only seeks to have a successful business,

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:12.174
but also a sustainable future.

00:06:12.174 --> 00:06:14.163
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:16.993
without compromising the
ability of future generations

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:19.581
to live in a greener tomorrow.

00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.180
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.636
and that makes me even more passionate to save it.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:27.014
But it's never enough to just
to get it through your heads

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:29.196
about the things that are happening in our world.

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:31.496
It takes to get it through your hearts,

00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:33.104
because when you get it through your heart,

00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:35.275
that is when movements are sparked.

00:06:35.275 --> 00:06:36.574
That is when opportunities

00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:38.246
and innovation are created,

00:06:38.246 --> 00:06:41.279
and that is why ideas come to life.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.306
Thank you, and peace and blessings.

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:51.944
(Applause)

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.715
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:58.015
Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:00.838
the amazing parents who are behind

00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:03.055
this incredible woman. Where are they?

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:06.053
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!

00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:09.807
(Applause)
