00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:14.892
This is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."

00:00:14.892 --> 00:00:17.963
It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel,"
which I did on Broadway,

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:21.333
and this one, I -- thank you --

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.995
I've excerpted it just for you,
so here we go.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.901
Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:37.618
all electronic devices are switched off
before we begin.

00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:43.375
So class, hopefully you'll recognize
what you just heard me say as the -- ?

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:47.199
Very good, the cellular
phone announcement.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.378
Right? This was also known
as a mobile phone.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.607
So you'll remember, people of that era

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:58.483
would have had an external
electronic device, right,

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.434
something like this,

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:03.370
and they all would have carried
one of these around with them,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.749
and amongst their biggest fears
was the sheer mortification

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:10.139
that one of these might ring
at some inopportune moment.

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.540
Right? So a bit of trivia
about that era for you.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.100
(Laughter)

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.851
So the format of today's class is

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.793
I will be presenting multiple
BERT modules today

00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:24.163
from that period in history, right,

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:26.973
so starting circa 2016.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:31.320
And remember, this was
the very first year of the BERT program.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.690
So we've got quite a few
of these to get through.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.697
Bear in mind, I will be living
into various different bodies,

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:38.875
different ages,

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:43.403
also what were then called races,
or ethnic groups,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.493
as you'll remember from Unit 1.

00:01:45.493 --> 00:01:48.813
And -- (Laughter) -- and along
the gender continuum,

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.321
I will be living into males as well.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:52.991
It was quite binary at that time.

00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:54.550
(Laughter)

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.867
Also, don't forget, we are reading
the book module

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.842
for next week's focus on gender.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:03.885
Now, I know some of you
have requested the book in pill form.

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:08.201
I know people still believe
ingesting it is better for retention,

00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:13.700
but since we are trying to experience
what our forebears did, right,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.207
let's please just consider doing
the actual ocular reading, okay?

00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:24.222
And also, how many people
have your emotional shunts engaged?

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:26.916
Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:31.861
I know it's challenging, but I want you
to be able to feel the entire

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.719
natural emo range, all right?

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.528
It is essential to this
part of the syllabus.

00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:39.126
Yes, Macy?

00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:43.627
All right. I understand.
If you're unwilling to --

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:45.996
All right, well, we can discuss
that after class.

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:48.429
All right, we will discuss your concerns.

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:52.549
Just relax. Nobody's died
and gone to composting.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.893
Okay. After class. Okay? After class.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.144
Let's just get started, okay.

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:05.552
This first subject identified
as a middle-class homemaker.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.851
Remember, these early modules

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:11.984
in these people's full identities
were protected,

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:15.200
and this allowed them to speak
more freely on our topic,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.133
which for many of them was taboo.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.732
Okay honey, now,
I'm ready when you are.

00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:26.960
No, sweetheart, I said,
I'm ready when you are.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.351
I'm freezing.

00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:33.206
It's like a meat locker in here
in this recording studio.

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:35.806
I should have brought a shmata.

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:39.405
All this fancy technology
but they can't afford heat.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.678
What is he saying? I can't hear you!

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:46.557
I can't hear you
through the glass, honey!

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:49.320
There you are in my ear.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.920
Oh, you can hear me?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.778
The whole time.

00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:56.864
Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.553
Yes, oh the cold is for the machines,
the new technology. Okay.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:09.304
Yes, now remind me again, you're recording
not only my voice but my feelings

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:11.604
and my memories? Right.

00:04:12.414 --> 00:04:14.433
Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:17.484
Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.

00:04:17.484 --> 00:04:22.641
Right, right, so people will be able
to feel my experience

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.543
and my memory? Okay.

00:04:24.543 --> 00:04:25.958
No, right, I'm ready.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.055
I just thought you were going to give me
a test to see how my memory's doing.

00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:33.272
I was going to tell you you're too late,
it's already bad news.

00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:37.648
No, no, go ahead, honey.

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:39.984
Oh, that's the first question?

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:43.258
What do I think of prostitution?

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:46.599
Are you soliciting me, young man?

00:04:47.483 --> 00:04:51.955
I've heard of May-December romances,
but what are you, about 20 years old?

00:04:53.102 --> 00:04:54.844
Eighteen? Eighteen years.

00:04:54.844 --> 00:05:00.463
I think I have candies in my purse
older than 18 years old.

00:05:00.463 --> 00:05:01.941
(Laughter)

00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:08.520
I'm teasing you, sweetheart.
No, I'm comfortable with any question.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.371
Sure. So about the prostitution --
oh, sex worker, sex worker.

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:19.920
No, just in my day, they called it
prostitution, not sex work.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.666
Oh, because it includes pornography also?

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.477
Okay.

00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:26.659
No, well, I guess when I was a girl,

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.167
we didn't really have
a name for that either.

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:34.902
We would have said dirty magazines,
I suppose, or dirty movies.

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:37.370
Well, it's not like what you have
with the Internet.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.636
No, well, I don't mind sharing.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:46.628
My late husband and I,
we were a very romantic couple.

00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:50.714
Lots of tenderness, you understand.

00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:55.164
Well, as you get older, you know,
at one point I thought my husband

00:05:55.164 --> 00:05:59.317
might be helped by using
some of the pills men can take,

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:04.413
but he wasn't interested in those,

00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:10.474
so I thought, what about maybe
watching an adult movie on the Internet?

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.908
Just for inspiration, you understand.

00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:18.906
Well, at the time, neither of us
were very good on the computer,

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:21.619
so usually, if we needed help
with the Internet,

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.597
we would just call our children
or our grandchildren,

00:06:26.597 --> 00:06:30.163
but obviously, in this case,
that wasn't an option,

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:35.588
so I thought, I'll have
a look myself, just to see.

00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:38.127
How difficult could it be?

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:41.760
You search for certain key words
and you look --

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.955
Oh wow is right, young man.

00:06:43.955 --> 00:06:46.672
You can't imagine what I saw.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:51.618
Well, first of all, I was just trying
to find, you know, couples,

00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:53.963
normal couples making love,

00:06:55.303 --> 00:06:59.791
but this, so many people
together at one time.

00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:03.599
You couldn't tell which part
belonged to which body.

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.778
How they even got the cameras to
capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.

00:07:07.778 --> 00:07:12.608
But the one thing they didn't capture
was making love.

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:19.388
There was lots of making of something,

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.497
but they took the love part
right out of it, you know, the fun.

00:07:23.497 --> 00:07:27.421
It was all very extreme, you know?

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.929
Like you would say,
with the extreme sports.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.778
Lots of endurance,

00:07:34.778 --> 00:07:37.800
but never tenderness.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.116
So anyway, needless to say,
that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,

00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:48.945
but it only showed up on the credit card
as "entertainment services,"

00:07:48.945 --> 00:07:51.732
so my husband was never the wiser,

00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.083
and after all of that,

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:57.572
well, you could say it turned out

00:07:57.572 --> 00:08:01.412
he didn't need the extra
inspiration after all.

00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:06.734
Right, so next subject is a young woman
-- (Applause) --

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.957
Next subject, class,
is a young woman called Bella,

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:14.904
a university student interviewed in 2016

00:08:14.904 --> 00:08:18.828
during what was called
an Intro to Feminist Porn class

00:08:18.828 --> 00:08:23.317
as part of her major in sex work
at a college in the Bay Area.

00:08:23.317 --> 00:08:26.672
(Laughter)

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.439
Yeah, I just want to, like,
get a recording of, like,

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.808
you guys recording me,

00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:33.897
like a meta recording, or whatever.

00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:38.611
It's just like this whole experience
is just, like, really amazing,

00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:42.131
and I'd like to capture that
for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.126
So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:48.633
and I am, like, being
interviewed right now

00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:55.505
for this, like, really amazing
Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,

00:08:55.505 --> 00:09:01.780
which is, like, basically where they are,
like, recording, as you can see

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.702
from these, whatever, like, electrodes,

00:09:03.702 --> 00:09:09.040
the formation of, like, neuropeptides
in my hippocampus, or whatever.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.920
They will later be able
to reconstitute these

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.280
as, like, my own actual memory,
like actual experiences,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.645
so other people can, like,
actually feel what I'm feeling right now.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.572
Okay. Okay.

00:09:26.572 --> 00:09:32.140
So, like, hello, BERT person of the future
who is experiencing me.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.557
This is what it feels like to be,
like, a college freshman,

00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:41.781
and also the, like, headache
that you are experiencing through me

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:48.200
is the, like, residual effect
of the Jell-O shots which I had last night

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.115
at the bi-weekly feminist
pole dancing party

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:54.157
which I cohost on Wednesdays.

00:09:54.157 --> 00:09:57.779
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" --
(Laughter) --

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:01.122
and it's in Beekman Hall,

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:04.250
and, what else, like,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.297
non-Jell-O shots are also
available for vegans,

00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:16.540
and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we
should also focus on your questions also.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.182
So for your record, I am, like,
a sex work studies major

00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:24.457
but minoring in social media

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.151
with a concentration
on notable YouTube memes.

00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:29.289
(Laughter)

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:33.490
Yes, well, of course, like,
I consider myself to be, like,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.579
obviously, like, a feminist.

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:40.571
I was named for Bella Abzug,
who was, like, a famous, like,

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:42.986
feminist from history,

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:49.255
and, like, also I feel that it is, like,
important to, like, represent women

00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:52.945
who are, like, sex-positive feminists.

00:10:54.224 --> 00:10:56.941
What is sex-negative?

00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:01.399
Well, like, I guess I would ask,
like, what do you think

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.417
sex-negative is? (Laughter)

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:09.314
Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use
are, like, so important, because, like,

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:16.352
we call it sex work because it helps
people understand that, like, it's work,

00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:21.228
and, like, you know, just like there are,
like, healthcare providers

00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:23.712
and, like, insurance providers,

00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:29.401
like, we think of these workers
as, like, sex care providers.

00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:34.184
Yeah, but like, I don't think of myself
like, providing direct

00:11:34.184 --> 00:11:38.433
sex care services per se as, like,
being a requirement

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:40.894
for me to be, like, an advocate.

00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:44.563
Like, I support other women's right
to choose it voluntarily, like,

00:11:44.563 --> 00:11:46.676
if they enjoy it.

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:49.509
Yeah, but, like, I see
myself going forward

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:53.247
as more likely, like,
protecting sex workers',

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:56.288
like, legal freedoms and rights.

00:11:56.288 --> 00:12:00.213
Yeah, so, like, basically,
I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:03.835
Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:07.921
So these next two modules
are also circa 2016.

00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:11.915
One subject is an Irishwoman
with a particularly noteworthy

00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.847
relationship to this issue,

00:12:14.847 --> 00:12:18.509
but first will be a West Indian woman,

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:20.831
a self-described escort

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:26.241
who was recorded at a
sex workers' rights rally and parade.

00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:30.792
She was interviewed whilst marching
in full carnival headdress

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.460
and very little else.

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:38.379
All right, you want me
to start talking now.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:41.509
Yeah, I told you, you can
put those wires anywhere you want to

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:44.536
as long as it don't get in the way.

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:50.069
Yeah, no, but, tell me again
what the name of -- BERT? BERT.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.108
Yeah, I was telling you, you know,
I think I have in all my time

00:12:53.108 --> 00:12:56.797
I have had at least one client with that
name, so this won't be the first time

00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:59.396
I had BERT all over me.

00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:05.218
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:08.670
but you got to get into the spirit of it
if you're going to interview me.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.536
All right? You can say it.

00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:12.934
No justice, no piece!
No justice, no piece!

00:13:12.934 --> 00:13:18.878
But you see the sign? You get it?
P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:20.790
You understand?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.244
Right, so that's the part
where I was telling you

00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:27.609
is that when I first came to this country,
I worked every job I could find.

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:32.299
I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant
for all these different old people,

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:36.422
and then I said, child, if I have to touch
another white man's backside,

00:13:36.422 --> 00:13:39.381
I might as well get paid
a lot more money for it than this,

00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:41.285
you understand?

00:13:41.285 --> 00:13:44.350
Pshh, you know how hard it is
being a domestic worker?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.729
Some of these men, they're heavy.

00:13:46.729 --> 00:13:49.528
You have to pick them up
and flip them over.

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:53.986
Now, I let them pick me up
and flip me over, you understand?

00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:57.399
Well, you have to have a sense of humor
about it, that's what I think.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:59.349
No, but see, listen,

00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:02.739
you find me somebody who don't hate
some part of their job.

00:14:02.739 --> 00:14:05.502
I mean, there's a lot of things
about this job that I hate,

00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:07.072
but the money is not one of them,

00:14:07.072 --> 00:14:09.891
and I will tell you, as long as this
is the best possibility

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.655
for me to make real money,

00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:15.811
I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin'
if that's what they want to call me.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:19.318
No, I'm not even from Jamaica.
That's how they market me.

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:22.545
My family is from Trinidad
and the Virgin Islands.

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:25.711
They don't know what I do,
but you know what?

00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:28.977
My children, they know
that their school fees are paid,

00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:31.484
they have their books and their computer,

00:14:31.484 --> 00:14:34.456
and this way, I know
that they have a chance.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:37.266
So I'm not going to tell you
that what I do, it's easy,

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:40.818
I'm not going to tell you that I feel --
what's that you said, liberated?

00:14:42.128 --> 00:14:44.920
But I'm going to tell you
that I feel paid.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.129
Right. (Applause)

00:14:50.872 --> 00:14:53.496
Thanks, that's lovely,
and just the cup of tea, love,

00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:55.470
and just a splash of the whiskey.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.200
It's perfect, that's grand.
Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.550
What was your name? Peter?
Is that right, so, Peter?

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.708
Right. So that, that is
the unique part of it for me,

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:09.401
right, is that I ended up in both,

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:14.550
first in the convent, and then
in the prostitution after. That's right.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.160
(Laughter)

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.120
So one woman at the university
here in Dublin, she wrote about me.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.820
She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living
embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.341
Right? (Laughter)

00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:30.359
Doesn't it sound like something
you need to go into hospital?

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:32.248
Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.

00:15:32.248 --> 00:15:33.411
Doesn't it.

00:15:33.781 --> 00:15:37.119
Right. Well, for me though, it was,
as a girl, it started with me dad.

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:40.394
I mean, half the time, when he
spoke to us, it was just a sort of

00:15:40.394 --> 00:15:44.856
tell us we were all useless rotten idiots
and we had no morals, that type of thing.

00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:48.177
And I certainly didn't
do myself any favors.

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:50.406
By the time I was 16,

00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:53.285
I had started messing about
with this older fella,

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:56.837
and he wanted it to be
our little secret,

00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:59.345
and I did as I was told, didn't I,

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:05.452
and when that got back to me dad, he
had me sent straightaway to the convent.

00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:10.420
Well no, that older fella, he would still
come to find me in the convent.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.766
Yeah, he'd leave me notes

00:16:12.766 --> 00:16:16.001
tucked into the holes in the brick
at the back of the charity shop

00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:17.188
so we could meet.

00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:20.915
And he'd tell me how
he's leaving his wife,

00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:25.141
and I believed him, until I got pregnant.

00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:30.458
I did, Peter, and I left him a note
about it in our special place there,

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:33.477
and I never did hear from him again.

00:16:33.477 --> 00:16:38.490
No, I gave it up for adoption
so it could have a decent life,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.675
and then they wouldn't let me
back into the convent.

00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:46.273
No, my one sister Virginia gave me
a fiver for the coach to Dublin,

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:48.221
and that's how I ended up here.

00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:53.120
Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love
with another fella much older than me,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.159
and I always say I was just so happy
because he didn't drink,

00:16:59.349 --> 00:17:01.502
I married the bastard.

00:17:02.502 --> 00:17:06.184
Well, he didn't drink, but he did have
just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:09.279
and -- That's right, and before I knew it,

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.903
he was the one who turned me on
to the prostitution, my own husband.

00:17:13.703 --> 00:17:15.771
He had me supporting the both of us.

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.314
I was 18.

00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:21.089
Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman,
I can tell you that.

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.356
That Julia Roberts,

00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:29.569
if she'd ever had to sleep with a man
to put a few pounds in her pocket,

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:32.110
I don't think she'd ever
have made that film.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.339
Well, for your record,

00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:37.520
my opinion of the legalization,
I'd say I'm against it.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.864
I just, I don't care what
these young girls say.

00:17:40.864 --> 00:17:43.975
You know, living like that,
you're just lost,

00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:46.483
and, you know, I'm 63 years old.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.523
I'm still trying to find who I am.

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:53.240
You know, I never was a wife or a nun,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.560
or a prostitute even, really, not really.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.648
Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.

00:17:59.648 --> 00:18:01.482
They just told me,

00:18:01.482 --> 00:18:03.433
and if you legalize it,

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:07.264
then you're really telling these girls,
"Go on and get lost for a living,"

00:18:07.264 --> 00:18:09.872
and a lot of them,
they'll do as they're told.

00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:15.669
All right, so four perspectives
from four quite -- (Applause) --

00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:17.829
four quite different voices there, right?

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:22.146
One woman saying sex itself is natural
but the sex industry seems to

00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:24.794
mechanize or industrialize it.

00:18:24.794 --> 00:18:29.162
Then the second woman considered
sex work to be empowering,

00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:32.991
liberating, and feminist,
though she, herself, notably,

00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:35.568
did not seem keen to do it.

00:18:35.568 --> 00:18:39.995
The third woman, who actually was
a so-called sex worker

00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:43.340
did not agree that it was liberating
but she wanted the right

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.100
to the economic empowerment,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.412
and then we hear the fourth woman
saying not only prostitution itself

00:18:48.412 --> 00:18:50.938
but proscribed roles for women in general

00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:54.398
prevented her from ever
finding who she was, right?

00:18:54.398 --> 00:18:56.395
So another fact most people did not know

00:18:56.395 --> 00:19:02.080
was the average age of an at-risk girl
being introduced to the sex industry

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.110
was 12 or 13.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.146
Also consider that the age
when all girls in that society

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.791
first became exposed
to sexualized images of women

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:13.345
was quite a bit earlier, right?

00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:18.105
This was a doll called Barbie, right?

00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:21.692
I initially thought she was an educational
tool for anorexia prevention --

00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:22.842
(Laughter) --

00:19:22.842 --> 00:19:26.209
but actually she was considered by many

00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:30.272
to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,

00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:33.615
and often young girls began
what was called dieting.

00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:37.854
Remember this? This was
restricting food intake on purpose

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:39.234
by the age of six,

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:42.061
and defining themselves
based on attractiveness

00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:43.901
by around that same time. Right?

00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:45.112
Yes?

00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:47.756
Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:52.585
So there was a lucrative market
in that society in convincing all people

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:56.463
they had to look a certain way
to even have a sex life, right?

00:19:56.463 --> 00:20:01.618
But girls, especially, were expected
to be "sexy" while avoiding

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.970
being perceived as "sluts"
for being sexual. Right?

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.237
So there's that shame piece
we've heard about.

00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:08.839
Yes.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.696
Valerie, right? Okay, very good.

00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:13.506
Of course, men were having sex as well,

00:20:13.506 --> 00:20:15.944
but you'll remember from the reading,

00:20:15.944 --> 00:20:17.625
what were male sluts called?

00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:20.541
Very good, they were called men.

00:20:20.541 --> 00:20:22.747
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:20:22.747 --> 00:20:28.319
So not easy living in
a world like that, right?

00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:30.711
Though it was not all bad news either.

00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.217
Most women in the early 2000s
considered themselves empowered,

00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:38.450
and men generally felt they were
also evolved in this area,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.300
and, in fact, most people would have
been aware of issues

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.235
like human trafficking, for example,

00:20:43.235 --> 00:20:45.636
but they would have seen that
as quite separate

00:20:45.636 --> 00:20:48.427
from more recreational
adult entertainment.

00:20:48.427 --> 00:20:51.850
And so we'll just very briefly, class --
we don't have a lot of time --

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.065
we'll just very briefly hear from a man

00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:55.839
on our topic at this stage.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:21:01.474
So this next subject was interviewed
on the night of his bachelor party.

00:21:03.426 --> 00:21:06.979
Dude, can you, all right,
can you just keep it down?

00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:09.185
I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.778
Oh, your name's not BERT.

00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:13.573
BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.

00:21:13.573 --> 00:21:16.638
No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine.
I'm mostly sober,

00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:19.473
so I just want to be helpful.

00:21:20.073 --> 00:21:23.892
Yeah, and I totally believe in causes,
yeah, like, all that stuff.

00:21:23.892 --> 00:21:25.332
(Laughter)

00:21:25.332 --> 00:21:27.714
And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:32.560
Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.887
like, you buy a pair and then
a kid in Africa gets clean water.

00:21:36.857 --> 00:21:38.394
Yeah. Totally.

00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:41.181
But what was the question again? Sorry.

00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:45.889
Of course I believe in women's rights.
I'm marrying a woman.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.389
(Laughter)

00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:52.018
No, but I mean, like, just because
I'm in a strip club parking lot

00:21:52.018 --> 00:21:55.042
doesn't mean that I'm, like,
a sexist or whatever.

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:59.454
My fiancee is totally amazing,
she's totally a strong girl, woman,

00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:01.949
smart woman, like, the whole thing.

00:22:01.949 --> 00:22:05.518
Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably
at a strip club herself right now,

00:22:05.518 --> 00:22:07.510
like, as a joke, same as me.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.602
My best man, I told him
he could surprise me,

00:22:09.602 --> 00:22:11.597
and he thought this would be hilarious,

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:13.700
but this is not something.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.720
Yeah, we all went to B school together.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.540
Wharton.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.724
(Laughter)

00:22:19.724 --> 00:22:22.171
Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --

00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:24.087
All right, but it's my bachelor party,

00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:27.595
and I can spend it in the parking lot
with Anderson Cooper if I want to.

00:22:27.595 --> 00:22:30.266
All right, I'll see you in there.

00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:33.214
All right, okay, so Anderson,

00:22:33.214 --> 00:22:37.111
so, like, first of all, stripping,

00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:39.895
but then, like, all the other things
you're talking about,

00:22:39.895 --> 00:22:43.403
prostitution and all that stuff,
that's, like, not the same thing at all.

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:46.659
You know? Like, you keep calling it
the sex industry or whatever,

00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:50.605
but it's like, if the girl wants
to be an exotic dancer

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:54.072
and she's 18, like, that's her right.

00:22:55.092 --> 00:22:58.340
Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying,
but I just feel like people,

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.976
they just want to make it seem
like all dudes are just, like, predators,

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:05.114
that we would just automatically
go to a prostitute, or whatever.

00:23:05.114 --> 00:23:09.410
Even, like, when I pledged, you know,
like when I rushed my fraternity.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.337
My brothers who I'm close to,
those guys, they're all like me.

00:23:13.337 --> 00:23:17.290
We're just normal people, but, like,
there's this myth that you must

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.928
be that guy who is kind of an asshole,
and like, all bros before hos or whatever.

00:23:21.928 --> 00:23:25.643
And actually, like, bros before hos,
it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.

00:23:26.603 --> 00:23:30.380
It's actually just like a joking way of
saying that you care about your brothers

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.516
and you put them first.

00:23:33.466 --> 00:23:35.576
Yeah, but, you can't blame
the media, either.

00:23:35.576 --> 00:23:38.110
I mean, like, if you
go watch "Hangover 2,"

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.264
and you think that's an instruction manual

00:23:40.264 --> 00:23:42.800
for your life, like,
I don't know what to tell you.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.862
You know? You don't
watch "Bourne Identity"

00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:49.106
and go drive your car
over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:52.672
Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're
a little kid or whatever,

00:23:52.672 --> 00:23:54.876
of course it's different, but --

00:23:54.876 --> 00:23:58.570
Yeah, all right, I remember
one thing like that.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.480
I was at this kid's house
one time playing GTA,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.510
uh, Grand Theft Auto?

00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:08.123
Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)

00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:12.986
So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,

00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:16.160
you're this kid, like, you're this guy
walking around or whatever,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.092
and you can basically, like,
the more cops you kill,

00:24:19.092 --> 00:24:21.763
the more points you get,
and stuff like that.

00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:24.601
But also, you can find prostitutes

00:24:24.601 --> 00:24:27.798
and obviously you can do
sexual stuff with them,

00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:31.655
but you can, like, kill them
and take your money back.

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:36.466
Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran over
a couple of them a few times with his car

00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:39.320
and he got all these points.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.755
We were, like, 10, I think.

00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:45.777
It felt pretty terrible, actually.

00:24:46.827 --> 00:24:52.215
No, I don't think I said anything,
I just finished playing and went home.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:55.770
All right class, so then there were men
who had more than just

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.135
a passing relationship to this issue.
(Laughter)

00:24:59.955 --> 00:25:04.880
The next subject described himself
as a reformed and remorseful pimp

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.526
turned motivational speaker,

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:08.964
life coach and therapist,

00:25:08.964 --> 00:25:12.934
but if you want to know more about him,
you'll have to come to the entire play.

00:25:12.934 --> 00:25:16.920
Thank you so much,
you beautiful TED audience.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.716
I will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:24.287
(Applause)
