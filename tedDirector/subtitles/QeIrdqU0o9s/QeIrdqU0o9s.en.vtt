00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:15.055
Vision is the most important

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:17.643
and prioritized sense that we have.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.327
We are constantly looking

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:21.101
at the world around us,

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.298
and quickly we identify and make sense

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:25.633
of what it is that we see.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:27.552
Let's just start with an example

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:28.825
of that very fact.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.835
I'm going to show you
a photograph of a person,

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:32.638
just for a second or two,

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:34.533
and I'd like for you to identify

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.672
what emotion is on his face.

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:37.900
Ready?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.612
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:42.943
Okay. What did you see?

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.207
Well, we actually surveyed

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.514
over 120 individuals,

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.464
and the results were mixed.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:51.731
People did not agree

00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:54.621
on what emotion they saw on his face.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.426
Maybe you saw discomfort.

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.415
That was the most frequent response

00:00:58.415 --> 00:00:59.670
that we received.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.759
But if you asked the person on your left,

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.500
they might have said regret or skepticism,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.429
and if you asked somebody on your right,

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:09.323
they might have said
something entirely different,

00:01:09.323 --> 00:01:12.143
like hope or empathy.

00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:13.702
So we are all looking

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.804
at the very same face again.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:18.232
We might see something

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:20.615
entirely different,

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.679
because perception is subjective.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.847
What we think we see

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:27.289
is actually filtered

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.693
through our own mind's eye.

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:31.946
Of course, there are many other examples

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:34.361
of how we see the world
through own mind's eye.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.143
I'm going to give you just a few.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:38.803
So dieters, for instance,

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:40.821
see apples as larger

00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.841
than people who are not counting calories.

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:47.474
Softball players see the ball as smaller

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.629
if they've just come out of a slump,

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:53.173
compared to people who 
had a hot night at the plate.

00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:56.123
And actually, our political beliefs also

00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:58.365
can affect the way we see other people,

00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:00.538
including politicians.

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:04.231
So my research team and I
decided to test this question.

00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.862
In 2008, Barack Obama
was running for president

00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:09.261
for the very first time,

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.243
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:14.466
one month before the election.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.165
What we found in this survey

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.451
was that some people, some Americans,

00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.147
think photographs like these

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.139
best reflect how Obama really looks.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.761
Of these people, 75 percent

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.628
voted for Obama in the actual election.

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:31.796
Other people, though,
thought photographs like these

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:34.085
best reflect how Obama really looks.

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.061
89 percent of these people

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.882
voted for McCain.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:41.388
We presented many photographs of Obama

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:42.985
one at a time,

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:45.884
so people did not realize
that what we were changing

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:47.737
from one photograph to the next

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:49.793
was whether we had artificially lightened

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:52.341
or darkened his skin tone.

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:53.901
So how is that possible?

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:56.736
How could it be that
when I look at a person,

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.457
an object, or an event,

00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.432
I see something very different

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:02.261
than somebody else does?

00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.551
Well, the reasons are many,

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.802
but one reason requires that we understand

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:09.355
a little bit more about how our eyes work.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.364
So vision scientists know

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:12.847
that the amount of information

00:03:12.847 --> 00:03:14.718
that we can see

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:16.557
at any given point in time,

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:19.254
what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:21.983
What we can see with great sharpness

00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:24.160
and clarity and accuracy

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.147
is the equivalent

00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:28.323
of the surface area of our thumb

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:30.618
on our outstretched arm.

00:03:30.618 --> 00:03:32.757
Everything else around that is blurry,

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:35.198
rendering much of what is presented

00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:37.842
to our eyes as ambiguous.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.116
But we have to clarify

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:42.364
and make sense of what it is that we see,

00:03:42.364 --> 00:03:45.749
and it's our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:49.318
As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:50.777
and that's how we end up seeing

00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:53.005
through our own mind's eye.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:54.818
So, I'm a social psychologist,

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.335
and it's questions like these

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:58.048
that really intrigue me.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:03:59.699
I am fascinated by those times

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.196
when people do not see eye to eye.

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:03.893
Why is it that somebody might

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:06.505
literally see the glass as half full,

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:07.985
and somebody literally sees it

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:09.456
as half empty?

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:12.577
What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:14.124
that leads them to see the world

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:16.484
in an entirely different way?

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:18.947
And does that even matter?

00:04:18.947 --> 00:04:21.998
So to begin to tackle these questions,

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:24.637
my research team and I
decided to delve deeply

00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:26.487
into an issue that has received

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:28.405
international attention:

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.128
our health and fitness.

00:04:30.128 --> 00:04:31.486
Across the world,

00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:33.888
people are struggling
to manage their weight,

00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:36.102
and there is a variety of strategies

00:04:36.102 --> 00:04:39.459
that we have to help us
keep the pounds off.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:42.565
For instance, we set
the best of intentions

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:45.262
to exercise after the holidays,

00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:47.860
but actually, the majority of Americans

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.902
find that their New Year's resolutions

00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:52.958
are broken by Valentine's Day.

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.460
We talk to ourselves

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.154
in very encouraging ways,

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:57.987
telling ourselves this is our year

00:04:57.987 --> 00:04:59.688
to get back into shape,

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:01.530
but that is not enough to bring us back

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.265
to our ideal weight.

00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:05.101
So why?

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:07.184
Of course, there is no simple answer,

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:09.947
but one reason, I argue,

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:11.873
is that our mind's eye

00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:13.474
might work against us.

00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:16.493
Some people may literally see exercise

00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:18.159
as more difficult,

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.973
and some people might literally

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:22.280
see exercise as easier.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.028
So, as a first step
to testing these questions,

00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:28.291
we gathered objective measurements

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.137
of individuals' physical fitness.

00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:33.479
We measured the 
circumference of their waist,

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.735
compared to the 
circumference of their hips.

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.204
A higher waist-to-hip ratio

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:40.387
is an indicator of being
less physically fit

00:05:40.387 --> 00:05:42.459
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.686
After gathering these measurements,

00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:46.499
we told our participants that

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.083
they would walk to a finish line

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:49.966
while carrying extra weight

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:51.123
in a sort of race.

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:52.910
But before they did that,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.350
we asked them to estimate the distance

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.037
to the finish line.

00:05:57.037 --> 00:05:59.333
We thought that the physical
states of their body

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:02.818
might change how
they perceived the distance.

00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:04.578
So what did we find?

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:07.286
Well, waist-to-hip ratio

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.302
predicted perceptions of distance.

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:12.932
People who were out of shape and unfit

00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:15.030
actually saw the distance
to the finish line

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.193
as significantly greater

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:18.084
than people who were in better shape.

00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:20.125
People's states of their own body

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:23.361
changed how they
perceived the environment.

00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:25.477
But so too can our mind.

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:27.386
In fact, our bodies and our minds

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.363
work in tandem

00:06:29.363 --> 00:06:31.971
to change how we see the world around us.

00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.066
That led us to think that maybe people

00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:35.344
with strong motivations

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:37.164
and strong goals to exercise

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.336
might actually see
the finish line as closer

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:44.036
than people who have weaker motivations.

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.378
So to test whether motivations

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:49.730
affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.653
we conducted a second study.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:54.334
Again, we gathered objective measurements

00:06:54.334 --> 00:06:56.338
of people's physical fitness,

00:06:56.338 --> 00:06:58.396
measuring the circumference of their waist

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:00.164
and the circumference of their hips,

00:07:00.164 --> 00:07:03.529
and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.072
Based on feedback that we gave them,

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:07.637
some of our participants told us

00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:09.945
they're not motivated
to exercise any more.

00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:12.339
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.472
and they weren't going
to do anything else.

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:16.091
These people were not motivated.

00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:18.233
Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,

00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:20.518
told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.

00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:23.230
They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.227
But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,

00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:28.197
we had them estimate the distance.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.945
How far away was the finish line?

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:32.307
And again, like the previous study,

00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:34.141
we found that waist-to-hip ratio

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.101
predicted perceptions of distance.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:40.733
Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:42.703
saw the finish line as farther away,

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.650
than people who were in better shape.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.659
Importantly, though, this only happened

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.593
for people who were not motivated

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.212
to exercise.

00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:51.802
On the other hand,

00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:54.846
people who were highly
motivated to exercise

00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:57.043
saw the distance as short.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:59.370
Even the most out of shape individuals

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.928
saw the finish line

00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:02.432
as just as close,

00:08:02.432 --> 00:08:04.267
if not slightly closer,

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:06.923
than people who were in better shape.

00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:08.882
So our bodies can change

00:08:08.882 --> 00:08:11.120
how far away that finish line looks,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.039
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.148
that they could accomplish
in the near future

00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:19.342
and who believed that they were capable

00:08:19.342 --> 00:08:20.938
of meeting that goal

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:24.354
actually saw the exercise as easier.

00:08:24.354 --> 00:08:26.264
That led us to wonder,

00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:28.681
is there a strategy that we could use

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.071
and teach people that would help

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.340
change their perceptions of the distance,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.821
help them make exercise look easier?

00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:38.455
So we turned to
the vision science literature

00:08:38.455 --> 00:08:40.201
to figure out what should we do,

00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:42.683
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy

00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:46.061
that we called, "Keep 
your eyes on the prize."

00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:47.872
So this is not the slogan

00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.757
from an inspirational poster.

00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:52.005
It's an actual directive

00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:54.927
for how to look around your environment.

00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.219
People that we trained in this strategy,

00:08:57.219 --> 00:09:01.093
we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,

00:09:01.093 --> 00:09:02.929
to avoid looking around,

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:04.270
to imagine a spotlight

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.883
was shining on that goal,

00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:08.372
and that everything around it was blurry

00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:10.178
and perhaps difficult to see.

00:09:10.178 --> 00:09:12.349
We thought that this strategy

00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:14.842
would help make the exercise look easier.

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.461
We compared this group

00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:18.119
to a baseline group.

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.324
To this group we said,

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:20.911
just look around the environment

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:22.160
as you naturally would.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.720
You will notice the finish line,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.423
but you might also notice

00:09:25.423 --> 00:09:27.292
the garbage can off to the right,

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:29.578
or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:32.263
We thought that people
who used this strategy

00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:34.365
would see the distance as farther.

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.812
So what did we find?

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:38.785
When we had them estimate the distance,

00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:40.533
was this strategy successful

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:43.033
for changing their perceptual experience?

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:44.231
Yes.

00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:46.436
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:49.485
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:51.096
than people who looked around

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:52.376
as they naturally would.

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:53.684
We thought this was great.

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:55.566
We were really excited because it meant

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:57.046
that this strategy helped make

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:58.938
the exercise look easier,

00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:00.872
but the big question was,

00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:02.709
could this help make exercise

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:04.100
actually better?

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.765
Could it improve the quality

00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:07.646
of exercise as well?

00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:09.909
So next, we told our participants,

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.804
you are going to walk to the finish line

00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:14.031
while wearing extra weight.

00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.051
We added weights to their ankles

00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.748
that amounted to 15 percent
of their body weight.

00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:20.696
We told them to lift their knees up high

00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:22.915
and walk to the finish line quickly.

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:25.075
We designed this exercise in particular

00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:26.797
to be moderately challenging

00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:28.574
but not impossible,

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:29.834
like most exercises

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.676
that actually improve our fitness.

00:10:32.676 --> 00:10:35.336
So the big question, then:

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.448
Did keeping your eyes on the prize

00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:39.780
and narrowly focusing on the finish line

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.545
change their experience of the exercise?

00:10:42.545 --> 00:10:44.140
It did.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.375
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:48.189
told us afterward that it required

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.284
17 percent less exertion

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:51.954
for them to do this exercise

00:10:51.954 --> 00:10:55.393
than people who looked around naturally.

00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:57.457
It changed their subjective experience

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:59.080
of the exercise.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.092
It also changed the objective nature

00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:03.391
of their exercise.

00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:05.639
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:08.287
actually moved 23 percent faster

00:11:08.287 --> 00:11:11.735
than people who looked around naturally.

00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:13.417
To put that in perspective,

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.090
a 23 percent increase

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.975
is like trading in your
1980 Chevy Citation

00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:23.619
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.

00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:26.131
We were so excited by this,

00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:28.298
because this meant that a strategy

00:11:28.298 --> 00:11:29.980
that costs nothing,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.747
that is easy for people to use,

00:11:31.747 --> 00:11:33.718
regardless of whether they're in shape

00:11:33.718 --> 00:11:35.576
or struggling to get there,

00:11:35.576 --> 00:11:37.016
had a big effect.

00:11:37.016 --> 00:11:38.573
Keeping your eyes on the prize

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.517
made the exercise look and feel easier

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.075
even when people were working harder

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.294
because they were moving faster.

00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:49.264
Now, I know there's more to good health

00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:51.286
than walking a little bit faster,

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:53.471
but keeping your eyes on the prize

00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:55.101
might be one additional strategy

00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:56.710
that you can use to help promote

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.025
a healthy lifestyle.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:01.106
If you're not convinced yet

00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:03.626
that we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:05.653
let me leave you with one final example.

00:12:05.653 --> 00:12:09.076
Here's a photograph of a beautiful 
street in Stockholm, with two cars.

00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:11.267
The car in the back looks much larger

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:12.693
than the car in the front.

00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:14.299
However, in reality,

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:16.678
these cars are the same size,

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:19.573
but that's not how we see it.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.697
So does this mean that

00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:23.411
our eyes have gone haywire

00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.981
and that our brains are a mess?

00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:28.553
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:30.574
It's just how our eyes work.

00:12:30.574 --> 00:12:33.263
We might see the world in a different way,

00:12:33.263 --> 00:12:35.035
and sometimes that might not

00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:37.101
line up with reality,

00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:39.226
but it doesn't mean
that one of us is right

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.321
and one of us is wrong.

00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.457
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,

00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:46.308
but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.

00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:48.132
So I can think of days

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:50.166
that have gone horribly wrong for me.

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.562
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,

00:12:52.562 --> 00:12:54.102
and I'm so behind,

00:12:54.102 --> 00:12:56.508
and there's a big black cloud

00:12:56.508 --> 00:12:57.991
hanging over my head,

00:12:57.991 --> 00:12:59.425
and on days like these,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.300
it looks like everyone around me

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.434
is down in the dumps too.

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:05.167
My colleague at work looks annoyed

00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:07.877
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,

00:13:07.877 --> 00:13:09.855
and my friend looks frustrated

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:12.554
when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,

00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:14.147
and at the end of the day,

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:16.173
my husband looks disappointed

00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:18.706
because I'd rather go to 
bed than go to the movies.

00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:21.723
And on days like these,
when everybody looks

00:13:21.723 --> 00:13:23.731
upset and angry to me,

00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:26.949
I try to remind myself that there
are other ways of seeing them.

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:30.259
Perhaps my colleague was confused,

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:32.695
perhaps my friend was concerned,

00:13:32.695 --> 00:13:35.962
and perhaps my husband was 
feeling empathy instead.

00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:37.856
So we all see the world

00:13:37.856 --> 00:13:39.682
through our own mind's eye,

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.685
and on some days, it might look

00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:43.093
like the world is a dangerous

00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:45.630
and challenging and insurmountable place,

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.600
but it doesn't have to look
that way all the time.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.796
We can teach ourselves
to see it differently,

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:53.462
and when we find a way to make the world

00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:55.399
look nicer and easier,

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:57.739
it might actually become so.

00:13:57.739 --> 00:13:59.294
Thank you.

00:13:59.294 --> 00:14:02.903
(Applause)
