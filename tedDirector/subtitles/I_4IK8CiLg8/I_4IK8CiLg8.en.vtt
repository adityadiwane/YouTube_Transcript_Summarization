00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I think it was in my second grade that I was caught

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I was sent straight away to my school principal,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and my school principal, a sweet nun,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
looked at my book with disgust,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and the nun slapped me on my face and said,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I had no clue what she was talking about,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.260
but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
until the ninth grade.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Thanks to a really boring lecture,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
I started caricaturing my teachers in school.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I'm not on top of the class.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So what I did was I quickly put together

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
a collage of all the teachers I had drawn,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
glorified my school principal, put him right on top,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and gifted it to him.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
He had a good laugh at the other teachers

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and put it up on the notice board.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
(Laughter)

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
This is a part of that.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And I became a school hero.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I have to tell you a little bit about my family.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
That's my mother. I love her to bits.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
She's a bit of a hippie.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
The rest of my family are boring academics,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
My father's a little different.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
My father believed in a holistic approach to living,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and, you know, every time he taught us,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
he'd say, "I hate these books,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
While he still held that worldview, I was 16,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I got the best lawyer in town,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
my older brother Karthik,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
from today onwards I've decided

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm going to be disciplined,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I'm going to be curious,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I'm going to learn something new every day,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I'm going to be very hard working,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and I'm not going to depend on you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
emotionally or financially."

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And I said, "Hold that thought."

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
I said, "Can I quit school then?"

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
But, to cut a long story short,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
But, most importantly, while I was traveling,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I taught children cartooning,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And mad and crazy and fun.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
When I was 18 I started my own school.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
is not easy unless you have a big patron

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
or a big supporter.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
when I saw that the Prime Minister of India

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
was visiting my home town, Bangalore.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And, you know, just like how

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
every cartoonist knows Bush here,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and if you had to meet Bush,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
it would be the funnest thing because

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
his face was a cartoonist's delight.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I had to meet my Prime Minister.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I went to the place where

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
his helicopter was about to land.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I saw layers of security.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
I caricatured my way through three layers

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
by just impressing the guards,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And what happened was, to my luck,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I saw a nuclear scientist

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
at whose party I had done cartoons.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
He said, "Oh, so am I."

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I hopped into his car, and off we went

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
through the remaining layers of security.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
(Applause)

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Thank you.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I sat him down, I caricatured him,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
This is one I remember fondly.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
(Laughter)

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
(Laughter)

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Should I just turn that off?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
The next slide I'm about to show you,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
is a little more serious.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
because this cartoon was published

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
soon after 9/11.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
What was, for me, a very naive observation,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
turned out to be a disaster.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.260
That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
hundreds of people telling me how they

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
could have lived another day without seeing this.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
I was also asked to leave the organization,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
a cartoonists' organization in America,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that for me was my lifeline.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
art comes with responsibility.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Anyway, what I did was I decided

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that I need to take a break.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and I decided to go traveling.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
When I went traveling, I remember,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I met this fabulous old man,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
who I met when I was caricaturing,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
hanging from the ceiling.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And I asked him, and he said,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
In the morning, I am born again."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
I thought he was koo koo,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
but something about that really stuck.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So, I wanted to be a painter like him,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
except, I don't know how to paint.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
So, I tried going to the art store.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Forget it, they will confuse you

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
even if you know how to draw.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I'm going to show you a very quick clip

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
to show you how I painted and a little bit

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
about my city, Bangalore.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:57.260
(Music)

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
They had to be larger than life.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And even bigger.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
It was so exciting.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Except, I even started painting dancers.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
except there was one problem.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and I made some money,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
sold my paintings and would rush off

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
to France or Spain and work with them.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
As much energy as I put into them

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
while making them, they never danced.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
I called my friends, painted on their bodies,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and had them dance in front of a painting.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And then I was fortunate enough

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And I sat like you guys there in the audience.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And I saw my work come alive.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
You know, normally you work in isolation,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and you show at a gallery,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
but here, the work was coming alive,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and it had some other artists working with me.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
The collaborative effort was fabulous.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I started doing fashion.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
This is a fashion show we held in London.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
The best collaboration, of course, is with children.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
They are ruthless, they are honest,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
but they're full of energy and fun.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.260
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
working with these kids.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And, in exchange for me working with them,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
they taught me how to be cool.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.260
(Laughter)

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Then I said, all this is good,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
but I want to paint like a real painter.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
American education is so expensive.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and I saw a billboard painter.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And these guys paint humongous paintings,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and they look really good.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And I wondered how they did it from so close.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
but we're leaving the city,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
because billboard painters are a dying,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
extinct bunch of artists,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
I will support them, and I started a company.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And since then, I've been painting all over the place.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
This is another painting.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And, in fact, I started painting on anything,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and started sending them around town.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
has been with her, Netra.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Netra and I met when she was 18.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
I must have been 19 and a half then,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and it was love at first sight.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
I lived in India. She lived in America.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
She'd come every two months to visit me,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
and then I said I'm the man,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I did that twice, and I went broke.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
We'll try and con them into buying it,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and then..."

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
that her dad's friends,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
like most of you, are geeks.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
I'm joking.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
(Laughter)

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
No, they were really big geeks,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and they didn't know much about art.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
So what we did was we rented a little van

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
She contacted anyone and everyone

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
who was willing to buy my work.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and made enough money to move me for four years

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
with lawyers, a company, everything,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and she became my manager.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
That's us in New York.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Notice one thing,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
we're equal here.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Something happened along the line.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
(Laughter)

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career --

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
it brought me a lot of success.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I loved the attention.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
This is all the press we got, and we said,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
it's time to celebrate.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I said, "Let's get married."

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
all the people who bought our work."

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
but I was determined to bring them to India, so --

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
a lot of them were in India.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.260
We had fashion designers, installation artists,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.260
models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
all kinds of people working with me

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to make my wedding an art installation.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
But all this excitement led

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
to the press writing about us.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.260
but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
My mother fell very ill.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
I love my mother

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And they said you have to say bye to her,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
you have to do what you have to do.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And I was devastated.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
I had shows booked up for another year.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
I was on a high.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And I couldn't. I could not.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
My life was not exuberant.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
I could not live this larger than life person.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Of course, my work turned ugly,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
but another thing happened.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
I lost all my audiences.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
The Bollywood stars who I would party with

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
and buy my work disappeared.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
The collectors, the friends, the press,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
everyone said, "Nice, but thank you."

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
"No thank you," was more like it.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
But I wanted people to actually

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
feel my work from their gut,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
because I was painting it from my gut.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
If they wanted beauty,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Of course, none of them liked it.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.260
My works also turned autobiographical.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
At this point, something else happened.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
A very, very dear friend of mine

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
came out of the closet,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
I was very upset.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
as a little girl -- that's me there --

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:11.260
(Laughter)

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
It's a secret.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:23.260
So, after this, my works turned a little violent.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.260
I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
This time, not only did my collectors disappear,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
the political activists decided to ban me

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and to threaten me

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and to forbid me from showing.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
So, I decided it was time

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
to end and go back home.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
This time I said let's try something different.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
I need to be reborn again.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
the best way to have a new lease on life,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is to have a child.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
I decided to have a child,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
How can a family get dysfunctional?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And Rudra was born.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
That's my little son.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And two magical things happened after he was born.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
My mother miraculously recovered

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
after a serious operation,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and this man was elected president of this country.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
You know I sat at home and I watched.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
So Netra and I wound up our life,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
closed up everything we had,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and we decided to move to New York.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And this was just eight months ago.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
I moved back to New York, my work has changed.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Everything about my work has become more whimsical.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
It talks about mental incest.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.260
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
(Laughter)

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
These are just different cartoons.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
I was talking to mother and father this morning,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
but you have to talk about your work with children."

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
So I said, okay.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
I work with children all over the world,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and that's an entirely different talk,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
but I want to leave you with one story

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
that really, really inspired me.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
I met Belinda when she was 16.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
I was 17.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
I was in Australia,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and Belinda had cancer,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.260
and I was told she's not going to live very long.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
They, in fact, told me three weeks.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.260
and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and I drew a crown for her.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
I told her how I ended up in Australia,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and all the stories.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
And I drew it out for her.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
And then I left.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
Belinda died

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and within a few days of her death,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
they published a book for her,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
and she used my cartoon on the cover.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
And she wrote a little note, she said,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
and touch children and be honest.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Thank you so much.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:48.260
(Applause)
