00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.160
and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it --

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160
it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
which you can't see there.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J --

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
My work is so personal and so strange

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,"

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
And the peak time for that was the 30s,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
because the Depression was so dismal

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
that anything to get away from the present into the future ...

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
and technology was going to carry us along.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days --

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
I had a huge collection of them from the '30s --

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.160
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.160
so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.160
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
for good reason, usually.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.160
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
You needed to know that.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
This is pitched into the future from 1946,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
looking at the day all American families have them.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.160
"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
so I think thatâ€™s a case for serious play.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.160
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.160
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
I think it adds a huge amount.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
They had two machine guns and a cannon,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And they had a canary hung inside the thing

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Happy little story, isn't it?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160
and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
It's a fond memory of times past.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.160
just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again --

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.160
says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
and it's so safe it carries no insurance.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
It's just a sick, silly joke.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.160
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.160
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that --

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
whoâ€™s to say?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.160
This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.160
I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
please apologize on our website."

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.160
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
This is the word side of my brain.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.160
(Laughter)

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
I love the word "Eurotrash."

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.160
(Laughter)

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.160
That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do --

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France --

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
sign of our times, I guess.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing --

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion --

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
"Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" --

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and --

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:22.160
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
This is a big joke.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
This is the audition for "King Kong."

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.160
(Laughter)

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg --

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was --

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160
and I don't think it will ever be done again --

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
successive pages in the front of the magazine.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:20.160
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
(Applause)

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
I would just like to add a crass commercial --

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
a compendium of all the serious play that ever was,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
and itâ€™s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
tables on the street in October.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
So thank you very much.
