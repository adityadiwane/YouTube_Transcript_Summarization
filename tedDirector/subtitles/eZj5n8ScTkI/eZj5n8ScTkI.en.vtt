00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:15.612
Election night 2008

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:18.971
was a night that tore me in half.

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.360
It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.733
[One hundred and forty-three] 
years after the end of slavery,

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.010
and [43] years after the passage

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.750
of the Voting Rights Act,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.790
an African-American was elected president.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.537
Many of us never thought that this was possible

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:42.309
until the moment that it happened.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.524
And in many ways, it was the climax

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.330
of the black civil rights movement

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.388
in the United States.

00:00:49.388 --> 00:00:51.237
I was in California that night,

00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:53.123
which was ground zero at the time

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:54.947
for another movement:

00:00:54.947 --> 00:00:57.940
the marriage equality movement.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.746
Gay marriage was on the ballot

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:02.830
in the form of Proposition 8,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.535
and as the election returns started to come in,

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:08.651
it became clear that the right

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.024
for same sex couples to marry,

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:14.076
which had recently been granted
by the California courts,

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:16.365
was going to be taken away.

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:18.548
So on the same night

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:22.830
that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.322
the lesbian and gay community suffered

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:28.600
one of our most painful defeats.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.127
And then it got even worse.

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:34.121
Pretty much immediately,

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:36.567
African-Americans started to be blamed

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.899
for the passage of Proposition 8.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.496
This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:44.255
that blacks had voted for the measure

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:46.740
by something like 70 percent.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.455
This turned out not to be true,

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:54.029
but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:57.286
and was grabbed on by the media.

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.972
I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:02.999
I listened to some gay commentator say

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.388
that the African-American community

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:07.403
was notoriously homophobic,

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:10.677
and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,

00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:12.810
we wanted to take away other people's rights.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.617
There were even reports of racist epithets

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:17.534
being thrown at some of the participants

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:19.200
of the gay rights rallies

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.819
that took place after the election.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.810
And on the other side,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.631
some African-Americans dismissed or ignored

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.150
homophobia that was indeed real in our community.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.800
And others resented this comparison

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.130
between gay rights and civil rights,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.675
and once again, the sinking feeling

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:41.694
that two minority groups

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.144
of which I'm both a part of

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:47.086
were competing with each other

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:49.777
instead of supporting each other

00:02:49.777 --> 00:02:54.303
overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.436
Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,

00:02:57.436 --> 00:03:00.479
so after going through my pissed off stage

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.559
and yelling at the television and radio,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.849
my next instinct was

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.928
to make a movie.

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:12.280
And what guided me in making this film was,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.078
how was this happening?

00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:17.278
How was it that the gay rights movement

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:20.589
was being pitted against the civil rights movement?

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.834
And this wasn't just an abstract question.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:26.189
I'm a beneficiary of both movements,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.273
so this was actually personal.

00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:30.868
But then something else happened

00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:33.829
after that election in 2008.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.217
The march towards gay equality

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:38.266
accelerated at a pace

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:41.288
that surprised and shocked everyone,

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:45.910
and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.963
our institutions and our entire country.

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:52.828
And so it started to become increasingly clear to me

00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:54.926
that this pitting of the two movements

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:58.508
against each other actually didn't make sense,

00:03:58.508 --> 00:03:59.740
and that they were in fact

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.061
much, much more interconnected,

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.251
and that, in fact, some of the way

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:07.570
that the gay rights movement has been able

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.145
to make such incredible gains so quickly

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:13.193
is that it's used some of the same tactics

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:16.880
and strategies that were first laid down

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.740
by the civil rights movement.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.493
Let's just look at a few of these strategies.

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:24.772
First off, it's really interesting to see,

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:26.740
to actually visually see, how quick

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.810
the gay rights movement has made its gains,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.996
if you look at a few of the major events

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:35.720
on a timeline of both freedom movements.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.302
Now, there are tons of milestones

00:04:39.302 --> 00:04:40.523
in the civil rights movement,

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:42.416
but the first one we're going to start with

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:46.312
is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.

00:04:46.312 --> 00:04:48.900
This was a protest campaign

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.845
against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:53.852
on their public transit system,

00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:56.711
and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks

00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.839
refused to give up her seat to a white person.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.117
The campaign lasted a year,

00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:04.216
and it galvanized the civil rights movement

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:07.183
like nothing had before it.

00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:10.035
And I call this strategy the

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:14.962
"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.

00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:19.303
So gays and lesbians have been in society

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:21.770
since societies began,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.377
but up until the mid-20th century,

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:28.762
homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:32.872
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:37.276
a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:40.495
It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.710
and it's where a group of LGBT patrons

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.392
fought back against police beatings

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:48.348
at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.540
three days of rioting.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.266
Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.197
were at the forefront of this rebellion,

00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:57.466
and it's a really interesting example

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.677
of the intersection of our struggles against racism,

00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:05.370
homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.932
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:11.271
sprang up all over the country,

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.891
and the modern gay rights 
movement as we know it took off.

00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.085
So the next moment to look at on the timeline

00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:22.230
is the 1963 March on Washington.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.365
This was a seminal event
in the civil rights movement

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:28.113
and it's where African-Americans called for both

00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:31.096
civil and economic justice.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.275
And it's of course where Martin Luther King

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:35.538
delivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:37.533
but what's actually less known

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:39.868
is that this march was organized

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:43.178
by a man named Bayard Rustin.

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:45.901
Bayard was an out gay man,

00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:48.533
and he's considered one of the most brilliant

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.450
strategists of the civil rights movement.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.196
He later in his life became a fierce advocate

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:57.073
of LGBT rights as well, and his life

00:06:57.073 --> 00:07:02.150
is testament to the intersection of the struggles.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.467
The March on Washington

00:07:03.467 --> 00:07:05.850
is one of the high points of the movement,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.020
and it's where there was a fervent belief

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.215
that African-Americans too

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:14.020
could be a part of American democracy.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.880
I call this strategy the

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.890
"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.353
Some early gay activists were actually

00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:25.433
directly inspired by the march,

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:28.639
and some had taken part.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.660
Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.687
"We marched with Martin Luther King,

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.289
seven of us from the Mattachine Society" --

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.740
which was an early gay rights organization —

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.291
"and from that moment on, we had our own dream

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.440
about a gay rights march of similar proportions."

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.130
Several years later, a series of marches took place,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.475
each one gaining the momentum

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:53.281
of the gay freedom struggle.

00:07:53.281 --> 00:07:55.718
The first one was in 1979,

00:07:55.718 --> 00:08:00.267
and the second one took place in 1987.

00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:03.993
The third one was held in 1993.

00:08:03.993 --> 00:08:07.258
Almost a million people showed up,

00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:10.799
and people were so energized and excited

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:11.899
by what had taken place,

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:14.298
they went back to their own communities

00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:15.931
and started their own political

00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:17.621
and social organizations,

00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:21.512
further increasing the visibility of the movement.

00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:23.429
The day of that march, October 11,

00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:26.090
was then declared National Coming Out Day,

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.984
and is still celebrated all over the world.

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:31.505
These marches set the groundwork

00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:34.225
for the historic changes that we see happening

00:08:34.225 --> 00:08:37.073
today in the United States.

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:40.614
And lastly, the "Loving" strategy.

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:42.790
The name speaks for itself.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.603
In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled

00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:47.492
in Loving v. Virginia,

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:49.612
and invalidated all laws

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.845
that prohibited interracial marriage.

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:54.760
This is considered one of the Supreme Court's

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.097
landmark civil rights cases.

00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:01.010
In 1996, President Clinton signed

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.581
the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,

00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:06.920
and that made the federal government

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.307
only have to recognize marriages

00:09:09.307 --> 00:09:13.276
between a man and a woman.

00:09:13.276 --> 00:09:15.690
In United States v. Windsor,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.837
a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor

00:09:18.837 --> 00:09:20.800
sued the federal government

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.546
when she was forced to pay estate taxes

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:25.048
on her deceased wife's property,

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:28.365
something that heterosexual 
couples don't have to do.

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:30.674
And as the case wound its way

00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:32.430
through the lower courts,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.267
the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.

00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:38.561
When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:40.284
the Supreme Court agreed,

00:09:40.284 --> 00:09:42.737
and DOMA was thrown out.

00:09:42.737 --> 00:09:45.131
It was incredible.

00:09:45.131 --> 00:09:46.778
But the gay marriage movement

00:09:46.778 --> 00:09:50.365
has been making gains for years now.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:52.930
To date, 17 states

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.509
have passed laws allowing marriage equality.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:58.187
It's become the de facto battle

00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:00.710
for gay equality,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.360
and it seems like daily,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.240
laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.827
even in places like Texas and Utah,

00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:11.145
which no one saw coming.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.140
So a lot has changed

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.402
since that night in 2008

00:10:15.402 --> 00:10:17.860
when I felt torn in half.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.210
I did go on to make that film.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.887
It's a documentary film,

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.950
and it's called "The New Black,"

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.905
and it looks at how the African-American community

00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:28.918
is grappling with the gay rights issue

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:31.364
in light of the gay marriage movement

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.925
and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.717
And I wanted to capture

00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:39.798
some of this incredible change that was happening,

00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:42.890
and as luck or politics would have it,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.886
another marriage battle started gearing up,

00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:47.510
this time in Maryland,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.997
where African-Americans make up 30 percent

00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:51.199
of the electorate.

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:54.265
So this tension between gay rights

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:58.229
and civil rights started to bubble up once again,

00:10:58.229 --> 00:11:00.292
and I was lucky enough to capture

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:03.702
how some people were making the connection

00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:06.780
between the movements this time.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.378
This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes

00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:12.632
and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,

00:11:12.632 --> 00:11:15.220
as they hit the streets of Baltimore

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.557
and try to convince potential voters.

00:11:17.557 --> 00:11:21.625
(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up,
man, this is a righteous man over here.

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.910
Okay, are you registered to vote?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.090
Man: No.
Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.901
Man: 21.
KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.

00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.691
We got to get you registered to vote.

00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:31.007
Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit.

00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:34.041
SM: Okay, why? What's up?
Man: I ain't with that.

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.350
SM: That's not cool.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.362
Man: What made you be gay?
SM: So what made you be straight?

00:11:40.362 --> 00:11:45.175
So what made you be straight?

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:49.322
Man 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)

00:11:49.322 --> 00:11:51.050
KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.304
but I know that because a black man like yourself

00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:54.723
stood up for a woman like me,

00:11:54.723 --> 00:11:56.532
I know that I've got the same opportunities.

00:11:56.532 --> 00:11:58.408
So you, as a black man, have the opportunity

00:11:58.408 --> 00:11:59.720
to stand up for somebody else.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.919
Whether you're gay or not,

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:02.400
these are your brothers and sisters out here,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.608
and they need you to represent.

00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:05.380
Man 2: Who is you to tell somebody

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.000
who they can't have sex with,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.325
who they can't be with?

00:12:08.325 --> 00:12:10.224
They ain't got that power.

00:12:10.224 --> 00:12:12.892
Nobody has that power to say,
you can't marry that young lady.

00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:14.696
Who has that power? Nobody.

00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:15.743
SM: But you know what?

00:12:15.743 --> 00:12:17.853
Our state has put the power in your hands,

00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:19.430
and so what we need you to do

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.910
is vote for, you gonna vote for 6.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.495
Man 2: I got you.

00:12:23.495 --> 00:12:25.409
SM: Vote for 6, okay?
Man 2: I got you.

00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:27.563
KSM: All right, do y'all need
community service hours?

00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:29.487
You do? All right, you can always volunteer with us

00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:30.918
to get community service hours.

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:32.244
Y'all want to do that?

00:12:32.244 --> 00:12:34.982
We feed you. We bring you pizza.

00:12:34.982 --> 00:12:37.672
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:37.672 --> 00:12:40.940
Yoruba Richen: Thank you.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.998
What's amazing to me about that clip

00:12:42.998 --> 00:12:46.392
that we just captured as we were filming

00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:49.160
is, it really shows how Karess

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.328
understands the history
of the civil rights movement,

00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:54.494
but she's not restricted by it.

00:12:54.494 --> 00:12:56.797
She doesn't just limit it to black people.

00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:58.857
She sees it as a blueprint

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:02.461
for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.

00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:05.390
Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.648
she's able to do this a little bit more easily,

00:13:07.648 --> 00:13:10.787
but the fact is that Maryland voters

00:13:10.787 --> 00:13:13.913
did pass that marriage equality amendment,

00:13:13.913 --> 00:13:16.333
and in fact it was the first time

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:19.212
that marriage equality was directly voted on

00:13:19.212 --> 00:13:21.581
and passed by the voters.

00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:24.545
African-Americans supported it at a higher level

00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:25.731
than had ever been recorded.

00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:28.720
It was a complete turnaround from that night

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.074
in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.

00:13:33.074 --> 00:13:36.874
It was, and feels, monumental.

00:13:36.874 --> 00:13:40.108
We in the LGBT community have gone

00:13:40.108 --> 00:13:44.055
from being a pathologized and reviled

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:45.859
and criminalized group

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:50.166
to being seen as part of the great human quest

00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:52.890
for dignity and equality.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.767
We've gone from having to hide our sexuality

00:13:56.767 --> 00:13:59.381
in order to maintain our jobs and our families

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.236
to literally getting a place at the table

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:03.520
with the president

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.646
and a shout out at his second inauguration.

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:08.207
I just want to read what he said

00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:10.169
at that inauguration:

00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:12.489
"We the people declare today

00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:15.525
that the most evident of truths,

00:14:15.525 --> 00:14:18.579
that all of us are created equal.

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:21.059
It is the star that guides us still,

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:23.285
just as it guided our forebears

00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:24.799
through Seneca Falls

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:29.220
and Selma and Stonewall."

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.057
Now we know that everything is not perfect,

00:14:33.057 --> 00:14:34.970
especially when you look at what's happening

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.953
with the LGBT rights issue internationally,

00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:41.504
but it says something about how far we've come

00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:44.908
when our president puts the gay freedom struggle

00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:46.893
in the context of the other great freedom struggles

00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:49.260
of our time: the women's rights movement

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.556
and the civil rights movement.

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.899
His statement demonstrates not only

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:56.571
the interconnectedness of those movements,

00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:58.819
but how each one borrowed

00:14:58.819 --> 00:15:02.084
and was inspired by the other.

00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:04.832
So just as Martin Luther King

00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:07.892
learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics

00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:10.131
of civil disobedience and nonviolence,

00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:13.230
which became a bedrock of
the civil rights movement,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.238
the gay rights movement saw what worked

00:15:16.238 --> 00:15:17.730
in the civil rights movement,

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.959
and they used some of those same strategies

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:21.875
and tactics to make gains

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:24.910
at an even quicker pace.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.997
Maybe one more other reason

00:15:26.997 --> 00:15:28.792
for the relative quick progress

00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:30.967
of the gay rights movement.

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:33.847
Whereas a lot of us continue to still live

00:15:33.847 --> 00:15:36.516
in racially segregated spaces,

00:15:36.516 --> 00:15:39.326
LGBT folks, we are everywhere.

00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:41.589
We are in urban communities

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:43.072
and rural communities,

00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:45.533
communities of color, immigrant communities,

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:49.097
churches and mosques and synagogues.

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:52.248
We are your mothers and brothers

00:15:52.248 --> 00:15:55.056
and sisters and sons.

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:57.682
And when someone that you love

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.562
or a family member comes out,

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:04.066
it may be easier to support their quest for equality.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:06.245
And in fact, the gay rights movement

00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:08.920
asks us to support justice and equality

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.423
from a space of love.

00:16:11.423 --> 00:16:13.883
That may be the biggest, greatest gift

00:16:13.883 --> 00:16:15.738
that the movement has given us.

00:16:15.738 --> 00:16:20.821
It calls on us to access that which is most universal

00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:22.733
and most intimate:

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:25.470
a love of our brother and our sister

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.395
and our neighbor.

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:30.198
I just want to end with a quote

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.332
by one of our greatest freedom fighters

00:16:32.332 --> 00:16:35.100
who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.403
of South Africa.

00:16:36.403 --> 00:16:39.304
Nelson Mandela led South Africa

00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:42.664
after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,

00:16:42.664 --> 00:16:47.399
and out of the ashes of that 
legalized racial discrimination,

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:50.363
he led South Africa to become the first country

00:16:50.363 --> 00:16:53.472
in the world to ban discrimination

00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:57.626
based on sexual orientation within its constitution.

00:16:57.626 --> 00:17:00.281
Mandela said,

00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:05.207
"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,

00:17:05.207 --> 00:17:08.150
but to live in a way that respects

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.399
and enhances the freedom of others."

00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:16.077
So as these movements continue on,

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.038
and as freedom struggles
around the world continue on,

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.698
let's remember that not only are they interconnected,

00:17:22.698 --> 00:17:26.589
but they must support and enhance each other

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.873
for us to be truly victorious.

00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:31.848
Thank you.

00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:37.408
(Applause)
