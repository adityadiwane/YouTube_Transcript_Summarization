00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.518
So, I'm afraid.

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:16.892
Right now,

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.437
on this stage,

00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:19.679
I feel fear.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.622
In my life, I ain't met many people

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:24.876
that will readily admit
when they are afraid.

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:27.461
And I think that's because deep down,

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.193
they know how easy it spreads.

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:31.843
See, fear is like a disease.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.020
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:37.310
But what happens when,

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:39.084
even in the face of that fear,

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:40.595
you do what you've got to do?

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:42.443
That's called courage.

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:44.857
And just like fear,

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.263
courage is contagious.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.938
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.122
That's a small city

00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.961
across the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, Missouri.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:58.058
I have lived in and around
St. Louis my entire life.

00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:01.567
When Michael Brown, Jr.,

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.843
an ordinary teenager,

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:07.417
was gunned down by police in 2014
in Ferguson, Missouri --

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:10.600
another suburb, but north of St. Louis --

00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:12.157
I remember thinking,

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.940
he ain't the first,

00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:17.828
and he won't be the last young kid
to lose his life to law enforcement.

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:19.969
But see, his death was different.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:22.208
When Mike was killed,

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:25.696
I remember the powers that be
trying to use fear as a weapon.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.528
The police response to a community
in mourning was to use force

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:31.775
to impose fear:

00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:34.182
fear of militarized police,

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.962
imprisonment,

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.155
fines.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.699
The media even tried
to make us afraid of each other

00:01:39.723 --> 00:01:41.275
by the way they spun the story.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.658
And all of these things
have worked in the past.

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:46.296
But like I said,
this time it was different.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:50.858
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent
treatment of the community

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:54.619
led to a string of protests in and around
Ferguson and St. Louis.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.145
When I got out to those protests
about the fourth or fifth day,

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:00.572
it was not out of courage;

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.499
it was out of guilt.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:04.588
See, I'm black.

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:06.788
I don't know if y'all noticed that.

00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:07.837
(Laughter)

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:13.338
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,
minutes away from Ferguson,

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:14.831
and not go see.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:17.297
So I got off my ass to go check it out.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.761
When I got out there,

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:21.194
I found something surprising.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.508
I found anger; there was a lot of that.

00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:27.599
But what I found more of was love.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.473
People with love for themselves.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.137
Love for their community.

00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:33.850
And it was beautiful --

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.463
until the police showed up.

00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:40.234
Then a new emotion was interjected
into the conversation:

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.018
fear.

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:44.132
Now, I'm not going to lie;

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.950
when I saw those armored vehicles,

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.135
and all that gear

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.525
and all those guns

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.310
and all those police

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:52.797
I was terrified --

00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:53.996
personally.

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:57.545
And when I looked around that crowd,

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.331
I saw a lot of people that had
the same thing going on.

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:03.548
But I also saw people
with something else inside of them.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.643
That was courage.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.045
See, those people yelled,

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.311
and they screamed,

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.887
and they were not about
to back down from the police.

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.559
They were past that point.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.834
And then I could feel
something in me changing,

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:16.496
so I yelled and I screamed,

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.797
and I noticed that everybody around me
was doing the same thing.

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.834
And there was nothing like that feeling.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.930
So I decided I wanted
to do something more.

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.729
I went home, I thought:
I'm an artist. I make shit.

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:34.380
So I started making things
specific to the protest,

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:38.501
things that would be weapons
in a spiritual war,

00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:42.184
things that would give people voice

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.940
and things that would fortify them
for the road ahead.

00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:50.287
I did a project where I took pictures
of the hands of protesters

00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.300
and put them up and down
the boarded-up buildings

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:56.000
and community shops.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.310
My goal was to raise awareness
and to raise the morale.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:02.735
And I think, for a minute at least,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.005
it did just that.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.310
Then I thought, I want to uplift
the stories of these people

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.740
I was watching being
courageous in the moment.

00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:15.329
And myself and my friend,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.922
and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan

00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:20.124
did just that with our documentary,

00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:21.459
"Whose Streets?"

00:04:23.316 --> 00:04:25.428
I kind of became a conduit

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:28.974
for all of this courage
that was given to me.

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:32.187
And I think that's part
of our job as artists.

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:36.601
I think we should be conveyors
of courage in the work that we do.

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:41.436
And I think that we are the wall
between the normal folks

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.916
and the people that use their power
to spread fear and hate,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.684
especially in times like these.

00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:50.058
So I'm going to ask you.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.860
Y'all the movers and the shakers,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.424
you know, the thought leaders:

00:04:54.448 --> 00:04:56.288
What are you gonna do

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:58.335
with the gifts that you've been given

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:00.800
to break us from the fear
the binds us every day?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.359
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.260
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:10.566
But once I figured out that fear
was not put in me to cripple me,

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.045
it was there to protect me,

00:05:13.624 --> 00:05:15.952
and once I figured out
how to use that fear,

00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:18.009
I found my power.

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:20.122
Thank you.

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:22.748
(Applause)
