00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I was only four years old

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
when I saw my mother load a washing machine

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
for the very first time in her life.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
That was a great day for my mother.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
My mother and father had been saving money for years

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
to be able to buy that machine,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and the first day it was going to be used,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
even Grandma was invited

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to see the machine.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And Grandma was even more excited.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Throughout her life

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
she had been heating water with firewood,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and she had hand washed laundry

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
for seven children.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And now she was going to watch

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
electricity do that work.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
My mother carefully opened the door,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and she loaded the laundry

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
into the machine,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
like this.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And then, when she closed the door,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Grandma said, "No, no, no, no.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Let me, let me push the button."

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And Grandma pushed the button,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and she said, "Oh, fantastic!

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I want to see this! Give me a chair!

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Give me a chair! I want to see it,"

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and she sat down in front of the machine,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and she watched the entire washing program.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
She was mesmerized.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
To my grandmother,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the washing machine was a miracle.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
people are using

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
so many different machines.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Look, the homes are full of machines.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
I can't even name them all.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And they also, when they want to travel,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
they use flying machines

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that can take them to remote destinations.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And yet, in the world, there are so many people

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
who still heat the water on fire,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and they cook their food on fire.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Sometimes they don't even have enough food,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and they live below the poverty line.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
There are two billion fellow human beings

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
who live on less than two dollars a day.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And the richest people over there --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
there's one billion people --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and they live above what I call the "air line,"

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
because they spend more than $80 a day

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
on their consumption.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But this is just one, two, three billion people,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and obviously there are seven billion people in the world,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
who live in between the poverty and the air line.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
They have electricity,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
but the question is, how many have washing machines?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
I've done the scrutiny of market data,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and I've found that, indeed,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
the washing machine has penetrated below the air line,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and today there's an additional one billion people out there

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
who live above the "wash line."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Laughter)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And they consume more than $40 per day.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So two billion have access to washing machines.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And the remaining five billion,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
how do they wash?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Or, to be more precise,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
how do most of the women in the world wash?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Because it remains hard work for women to wash.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
They wash like this: by hand.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's a hard, time-consuming labor,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
which they have to do for hours every week.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to do the laundry at home,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And they want the washing machine.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
doing this hard work

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
with so relatively low productivity.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And there's nothing different in their wish

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
than it was for my grandma.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Look here, two generations ago in Sweden --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
picking water from the stream,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
heating with firewood and washing like that.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
How can we tell this woman

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that she ain't going to have a washing machine?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And then I ask my students,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
"How many of you doesn't use a car?"

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And some of them proudly raise their hand

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and say, "I don't use a car."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And then I put the really tough question:

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
"How many of you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And no one raised their hand.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Even the hardcore in the green movement

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
use washing machines.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
(Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Here we are.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Look here, you see the seven billion people up there:

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the air people, the wash people,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
the bulb people and the fire people.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
One unit like this

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is an energy unit of fossil fuel --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
oil, coal or gas.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And it's 12 units used in the entire world,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and the richest one billion, they use six of them.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And these ones who have washing machines,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but not a house full of other machines,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
they use two.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
This group uses three, one each.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And they also have electricity.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And over there they don't even use one each.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
That makes 12 of them.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
But the main concern

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
is about the future.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
without any real advanced analysis, to 2050,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
there are two things that can increase the energy use.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
First, population growth.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Second, economic growth.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
because they have high child mortality

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and they have many children per woman.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And [with] that you will get two extra,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
but that won't change the energy use very much.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
What will happen is economic growth.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
The best of here in the emerging economies --

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
I call them the New East --

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
they will jump the air line.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
"Wopp!" they will say.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And these people, they want the washing machine.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I told you. They'll go there.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And they will double their energy use.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
But the total energy consumption

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
will increase to 22 units.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And these 22 units --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
still the richest people use most of it.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So what needs to be done?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Because the risk,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the high probability of climate change is real.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
It's real.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Of course they must be more energy-efficient.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
They must change behavior in some way.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
They must also start to produce green energy,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
much more green energy.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
But until they have the same energy consumption per person,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
they shouldn't give advice to others --

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
what to do and what not to do.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
(Applause)

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Here we can get more green energy all over.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
This is what we hope may happen.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
It's a real challenge in the future.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
she wants a washing machine.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
She's very happy about her minister of energy

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that provided electricity to everyone --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
so happy that she even voted for her.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And she became Dilma Rousseff,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
the president-elect

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
of one of the biggest democracies in the world --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
moving from minister of energy to president.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
If you have democracy,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
people will vote for washing machines.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
They love them.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And what's the magic with them?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
My mother explained the magic with this machine

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
the very, very first day.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
She said, "Now Hans,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
we have loaded the laundry.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The machine will make the work.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And now we can go to the library."

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Because this is the magic:

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
you load the laundry,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and what do you get out of the machine?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
You get books out of the machines,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
children's books.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And mother got time to read for me.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
She loved this. I got the "ABC's" --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
this is where I started my career as a professor,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
when my mother had time to read for me.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And she also got books for herself.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
She managed to study English

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and learn that as a foreign language.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And she read so many novels,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
so many different novels here.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And we really, we really loved this machine.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And what we said, my mother and me,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
"Thank you industrialization.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Thank you steel mill.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Thank you power station.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And thank you chemical processing industry
