00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:19.337
I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:23.799
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.102
creatures from a far-distant world.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:28.889
But basically, I figured out that I could find

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.866
those alien creatures right on Earth.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.519
And what I do is I study insects.

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.775
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:40.916
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.658
one of the most important events in the history of life.

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:45.895
Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:47.811
Without flowering plants, there would be no

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:50.948
clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:53.248
(Laughter)

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:55.235
Now,

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.274
David and Hidehiko and Ketaki

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.719
gave a very compelling story about

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.524
the similarities between fruit flies and humans,

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:06.013
and there are many similarities,

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:09.015
and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.812
the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:15.094
(Laughter)

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:18.285
but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:21.352
between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:26.639
and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.495
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:33.430
of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.640
and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.075
that is going to go at the fly.

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:40.913
The fly is going to sense this predator.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.368
It is going to extend its legs out.

00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:44.981
It's going to sashay away

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.546
to live to fly another day.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:49.908
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:53.068
to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.902
so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,

00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:59.167
the fly has seen this looming predator,

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:05.335
estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:09.799
beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.772
I think this is a fascinating behavior

00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:15.693
that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.

00:02:15.693 --> 00:02:18.535
Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:21.399
Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.134
you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:27.680
you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.389
and you need a controller,

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.015
and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:36.327
the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.

00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:39.080
Now, how does this compare to a fly?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.331
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:46.667
how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.277
And you might have heard how engineers proved

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:50.911
that bumblebees couldn't fly.

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.531
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings

00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:56.650
function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.504
And we tackle this problem by building giant,

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:02.936
dynamically scaled model robot insects

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:06.272
that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:08.546
where we could study the aerodynamic forces.

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.704
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.296
in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:16.417
that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:19.616
a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.570
and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.929
to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.357
But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:31.332
is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.

00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:34.977
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,

00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:38.113
which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.760
and this is what enables flies to perform

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.567
these remarkable aerial maneuvers.

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.664
Now, what about the engine?

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:48.156
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.054
They have two types of flight muscle:

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:53.039
so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.765
which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled

00:03:56.765 --> 00:04:00.104
on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.

00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:04.713
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,

00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:06.792
and it fills the middle portion of the fly,

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:08.339
so when a fly hits your windshield,

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.745
it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:12.891
But attached to the base of the wing

00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:15.529
is a set of little, tiny control muscles

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.830
that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.036
and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing

00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:23.798
on a stroke-by-stroke basis,

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:26.940
and this is what enables the fly to change its wing

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.911
and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.484
which change its flight trajectory.

00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:36.047
And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.

00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:37.559
So let's look at the controller.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.206
Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.490
that they carry to this problem.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.617
They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:48.292
They have a sophisticated eye which is

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:50.748
the fastest visual system on the planet.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.784
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:54.836
We have no idea what they do.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.790
They have sensors on their wing.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.550
Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.596
that sense deformation of the wing.

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.705
They can even taste with their wings.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.260
One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.067
is a structure called the halteres.

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:11.946
The halteres are actually gyroscopes.

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:16.395
These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:19.068
and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:23.036
and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:25.365
But all of this sensory information has to be processed

00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:29.085
by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:32.244
a brain of about 100,000 neurons.

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:34.437
Now several people at this conference

00:05:34.437 --> 00:05:39.245
have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:42.492
because they're a simple model of brain function.

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.569
And the basic punchline of my talk is,

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.227
I'd like to turn that over on its head.

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.855
I don't think they're a simple model of anything.

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:52.332
And I think that flies are a great model.

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:54.848
They're a great model for flies.

00:05:54.848 --> 00:05:57.329
(Laughter)

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:00.332
And let's explore this notion of simplicity.

00:06:00.332 --> 00:06:02.763
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,

00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.595
we're all somewhat narcissistic.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:08.028
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:09.988
But remember that this kind of brain,

00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:11.756
which is much, much smaller

00:06:11.756 --> 00:06:14.434
— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —

00:06:14.434 --> 00:06:17.316
but this is the most common form of brain on the planet

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:20.220
and has been for 400 million years.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.508
And is it fair to say that it's simple?

00:06:22.508 --> 00:06:24.603
Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,

00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:26.357
but is that a fair metric?

00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:28.633
And I would propose it's not a fair metric.

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:31.733
So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:33.292
(Laughter) —

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:38.413
we have to compare the size of the brain

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:40.443
with what the brain can do.

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:43.324
So I propose we have a Trump number,

00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:46.189
and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.868
behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.536
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.

00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:55.220
Now, how many people here think the Trump number

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.709
is higher for the fruit fly?

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.140
(Applause)

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.568
It's a very smart, smart audience.

00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.895
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:09.277
Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd

00:07:09.277 --> 00:07:12.835
to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:16.978
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:21.283
A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.

00:07:21.283 --> 00:07:23.310
I used to study mice. When I studied mice,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.147
I used to talk really slowly.

00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:28.723
And then something happened when I started to work on flies.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:31.135
(Laughter)

00:07:31.135 --> 00:07:34.595
And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:37.908
it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.

00:07:37.908 --> 00:07:40.355
They have to engage in courtship.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:43.826
They have sex. They hide from predators.

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:45.806
They do a lot of the similar things.

00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:47.524
But I would argue that flies do more.

00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:50.902
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,

00:07:50.902 --> 00:07:55.107
and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:57.179
so I'm showing this classified sequence

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:01.272
and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.180
So I want you to look at the payload

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.206
at the tail of the fruit fly.

00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:08.307
Watch it very closely,

00:08:08.307 --> 00:08:12.604
and you'll see why my six-year-old son

00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:17.333
now wants to be a neuroscientist.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.512
Wait for it.

00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.081
Pshhew.

00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:23.165
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:28.081
they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)

00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:32.048
Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers

00:08:32.048 --> 00:08:34.646
but also the challenge for a fly to compute

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:37.495
everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:40.483
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse

00:08:40.483 --> 00:08:43.251
that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,

00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:46.498
and you can see the wonderful images of brains

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:49.691
that he showed in his talk.

00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:52.059
But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:56.171
at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.

00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.012
And I'll expand this up.

00:08:58.012 --> 00:09:00.182
And it's a beautifully complex neuron.

00:09:00.182 --> 00:09:03.667
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:07.290
with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.827
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.

00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:13.039
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:15.838
it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:18.934
it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:20.316
to parasatize,

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:24.431
but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.400
which is comparable for a fruit fly,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.326
it is the size of a salt grain.

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:32.961
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.

00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:37.091
This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,

00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:40.971
and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --

00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:43.427
you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,

00:09:43.427 --> 00:09:45.078
where the nucleus of the neuron is?

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:48.538
This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.

00:09:48.538 --> 00:09:51.011
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.

00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:56.371
I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.

00:09:56.371 --> 00:10:02.004
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?

00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:04.526
And I think, from an engineering perspective,

00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:06.255
you think of multiplexing.

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:08.958
You can take a hardware and have that hardware

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.571
do different things at different times,

00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:13.566
or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:16.837
And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.

00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:18.495
And they're not concepts that I've come up with,

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:23.040
but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.115
And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.

00:10:26.115 --> 00:10:27.982
And I don't mean chewing the crabs.

00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:31.581
I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.

00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:34.438
But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.

00:10:34.438 --> 00:10:36.468
Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:39.727
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:41.037
called the gastric mill

00:10:41.037 --> 00:10:43.467
that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:48.726
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:51.286
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:54.718
by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons

00:10:54.718 --> 00:10:59.681
that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,

00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:04.028
and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion

00:11:04.028 --> 00:11:08.212
in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.

00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:10.353
You heard about neuromodulators earlier.

00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:12.578
There are more neuromodulators

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:18.063
that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,

00:11:18.063 --> 00:11:22.305
and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.

00:11:22.305 --> 00:11:25.746
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues

00:11:25.746 --> 00:11:28.041
who've been studying this fascinating system

00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.193
that show how a smaller cluster of neurons

00:11:30.193 --> 00:11:32.018
can do many, many, many things

00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:36.874
because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.

00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:39.313
So this is basically multiplexing in time.

00:11:39.313 --> 00:11:42.098
Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.

00:11:42.098 --> 00:11:45.576
You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:48.194
another neuromodulator, another set of cells,

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:49.907
a different pattern, and you can imagine

00:11:49.907 --> 00:11:53.785
you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.

00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:55.879
Is there any evidence that flies do this?

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:59.254
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,

00:11:59.254 --> 00:12:01.902
we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.

00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:03.608
You can tether a fly to a little stick.

00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:06.109
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.

00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:08.655
You can let the fly play a little video game

00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:12.533
by letting it fly around in a visual display.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:14.870
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.097
Here's a fly

00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:19.534
and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:21.489
and this is a game the flies love to play.

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:23.926
You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,

00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:26.751
and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.

00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:30.309
It's part of their visual guidance system.

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:32.654
But very, very recently, it's been possible

00:12:32.654 --> 00:12:37.594
to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.

00:12:37.594 --> 00:12:40.082
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,

00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:42.525
Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:44.211
and it's basically a flight simulator

00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:47.286
but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode

00:12:47.286 --> 00:12:49.550
in the brain of the fly and record

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.206
from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:55.504
And this is what one of these experiments looks like.

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:58.475
It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,

00:12:58.475 --> 00:12:59.674
Bettina Schnell.

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:03.066
The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential

00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:05.096
of a neuron in the fly's brain,

00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:08.038
and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:11.317
controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself

00:13:11.317 --> 00:13:12.796
by its own wing motion,

00:13:12.796 --> 00:13:14.906
and you can see this visual interneuron

00:13:14.906 --> 00:13:18.814
respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.

00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:21.190
So for the first time we've actually been able to record

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.098
from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly

00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:28.566
is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:30.421
And one of the lessons we've been learning

00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:32.841
is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying

00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:35.262
for many years in quiescent flies

00:13:35.262 --> 00:13:37.910
is not the same as the physiology of those cells

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.646
when the flies actually engage in active behaviors

00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:43.185
like flying and walking and so forth.

00:13:43.185 --> 00:13:46.110
And why is the physiology different?

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.167
Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,

00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:52.118
just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.

00:13:52.118 --> 00:13:54.668
So here's a picture of the octopamine system.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.422
Octopamine is a neuromodulator

00:13:56.422 --> 00:14:00.758
that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.

00:14:00.758 --> 00:14:03.230
But this is just one of many neuromodulators

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.301
that's in the fly's brain.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:06.967
So I really think that, as we learn more,

00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:09.494
it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:12.583
is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:16.943
and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:19.730
Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.386
is multiplexing in space,

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:23.080
having different parts of a neuron

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.202
do different things at the same time.

00:14:25.202 --> 00:14:27.035
So here's two sort of canonical neurons

00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:29.320
from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.570
a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.573
and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,

00:14:36.573 --> 00:14:40.720
and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.795
and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea

00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:46.677
based on the fact that this neuron from a locust

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.636
does not fire action potentials.

00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:50.384
It's a non-spiking cell.

00:14:50.384 --> 00:14:53.164
So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,

00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:55.916
has a region called the dendrites that receives input,

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.505
and that input sums together

00:14:58.505 --> 00:15:00.801
and will produce action potentials

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.132
that run down the axon and then activate

00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:05.428
all the output regions of the neuron.

00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:08.304
But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated

00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:11.416
because they can have input synapses and output synapses

00:15:11.416 --> 00:15:15.079
all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:18.205
that drives all the outputs at the same time.

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:22.112
So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments

00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:26.090
that allow the different parts of the neuron

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.650
to do different things at the same time.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.321
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time

00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:35.682
and multitasking in space,

00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:38.514
I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,

00:15:38.514 --> 00:15:41.091
but I think the insects are the true masters of this.

00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:44.207
So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,

00:15:44.207 --> 00:15:47.142
and as I say up here, please think before you swat.

00:15:47.142 --> 00:15:50.095
(Applause)
