00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.620
I would like to talk to you about

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.252
a very special group of animals.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:24.253
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:28.861
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.873
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:35.849
that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:38.808
greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:46.135
associated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:48.910
I want to change that perception. I want to change

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.620
those feelings you have for these birds, because

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.670
they need our sympathy. They really do. (Laughter)

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.219
And I'll tell you why.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.811
First of all, why do they have such a bad press?

00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:03.798
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:06.990
on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830
and he said, "These are disgusting birds

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.891
with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." (Laughter)

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.461
You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. (Laughter)

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:23.322
You know, he changed his mind when he came back,

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.638
and I'll tell you why.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:27.929
They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) —

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.721
personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:36.297
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:43.416
— (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) —

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:46.768
these are the attributes that they associated

00:01:46.768 --> 00:01:50.080
the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.632
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?

00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:55.352
Because MPs

00:01:55.352 --> 00:02:00.223
do not keep the environment clean. (Laughter)

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:05.185
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:11.534
They are hardly monogamous. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:15.297
They are far from being extinct. (Laughter)

00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:22.198
And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. (Applause) (Laughter)

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:26.149
So there's two types of vultures in this planet.

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.422
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found

00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:31.363
in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:33.662
and then the Old World vultures, where we have

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:37.150
16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.237
a high risk of extinction.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:43.654
So why are vultures important? First of all,

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:47.135
they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:49.429
They're our natural garbage collectors.

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.062
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.

00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:55.700
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.373
that would otherwise spread and cause

00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:02.457
huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:05.196
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:08.199
no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.768
to decompose, and this has huge ramifications

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:13.663
for the spread of diseases.

00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:17.079
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.323
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:23.423
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector

00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:26.511
and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,

00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:30.625
symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:34.433
In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.705
and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:42.362
from the 10-headed demon Ravana.

00:03:42.362 --> 00:03:45.793
In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:48.505
sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:51.569
to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.757
so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:58.224
So what is the problem with vultures?

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:01.095
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:05.082
of which six are highly threatened with extinction.

00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:07.701
The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:10.293
that they're getting poisoned is because there's

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.981
human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities

00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.333
are using this poison to target predators,

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.968
and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.632
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,

00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:26.113
four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,

00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:29.464
which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:32.774
and the reason is because they are falling prey

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:35.222
by consuming livestock that has been treated

00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:37.894
with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:40.991
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,

00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.510
and they have taken a stand.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.830
Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.631
in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,

00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.812
and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:54.454
of rabies. The number of cases of rabies

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:57.182
has increased tremendously in India.

00:04:57.182 --> 00:05:00.627
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:

00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:03.863
353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.

00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:06.143
I am not against wind energy, but we need to work

00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:09.352
with the governments, because wind turbines

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.952
do this to birds. They slice them in half.

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:14.786
They are bird-blending machines.

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:17.464
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade

00:05:17.464 --> 00:05:22.835
of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:25.667
So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:28.947
on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.

00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:31.323
We're trying to determine their basic ecology,

00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:33.762
and see where they go.

00:05:33.762 --> 00:05:35.803
We can see that they travel different countries, so

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:39.099
if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.806
We need to work with governments in regional levels.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:44.742
We're working with local communities.

00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:47.884
We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:50.439
about the need from within to appreciate these

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.476
wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.489
How can you help? You can become active,

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:59.212
make noise. You can write a letter to your government

00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:01.522
and tell them that we need to focus on these very

00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:04.700
misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.316
to spread the word. Spread the word.

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:09.660
When you walk out of this room, you will be informed

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.460
about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.621
to your neighbors about vultures.

00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:17.684
They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said

00:06:17.684 --> 00:06:20.713
he changed his mind because he watched them fly

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.978
effortlessly without energy in the skies.

00:06:23.978 --> 00:06:26.857
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer

00:06:26.857 --> 00:06:29.442
without these wonderful species.

00:06:29.442 --> 00:06:33.442
Thank you very much. (Applause)
