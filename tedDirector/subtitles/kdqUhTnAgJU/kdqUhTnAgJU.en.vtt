00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:14.780
We are all activists now.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.716
(Applause)

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.940
Thank you.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.836
I'll just stop here.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.036
(Laughter)

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
From the families who are fighting
to maintain funding for public schools,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.836
the tens of thousands of people
who joined Occupy Wall Street

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.036
or marched with Black Lives Matter

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.620
to protest police brutality
against African Americans,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.076
families that join rallies,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
pro-life and pro-choice,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.156
those of us who are afraid

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.556
that our friends and neighbors
are going to be deported

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.556
or that they'll be added to lists

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.900
because they are Muslim,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.540
people who advocate for gun rights
and for gun control

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.956
and the millions of people
who joined the women's marches

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.756
all across the country this last January.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.436
(Applause)

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.556
We are all activists now,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.060
and that means that we all have something
to worry about from surveillance.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.836
Surveillance means
government collection and use

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.076
of private and sensitive data about us.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.036
And surveillance is essential

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.156
to law enforcement
and to national security.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.156
But the history of surveillance

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.676
is one that includes surveillance abuses

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.156
where this sensitive information
has been used against people

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.716
because of their race,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.516
their national origin,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.596
their sexual orientation,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.796
and in particular,
because of their activism,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.420
their political beliefs.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.196
About 53 years ago,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.756
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
gave his "I have a dream" speech

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.060
on the Mall in Washington.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.556
And today the ideas behind this speech
of racial equality and tolerance

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.516
are so noncontroversial

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.220
that my daughters
study the speech in third grade.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.316
But at the time,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.740
Dr. King was extremely controversial.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.836
The legendary and notorious
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.676
or wanted to believe,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.275
that the Civil Rights Movement
was a Soviet communist plot

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.460
intended to destabilize
the American government.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.156
And so Hoover had his agents
put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.716
and those bugs picked up conversations
between civil rights leaders

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.180
talking about the strategies and tactics
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.116
They also picked up sounds of Dr. King

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.996
having sex with women
who were not his wife,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.756
and J. Edgar Hoover
saw the opportunity here

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.420
to discredit and undermine
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.836
The FBI sent a package of these recordings

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.940
along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.380
and a draft of this note
was found in FBI archives years later,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.836
and the letter said,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.636
"You are no clergyman and you know it.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.220
King, like all frauds,
your end is approaching."

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.700
The letter even seemed
to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.156
saying, "King, there is
only one thing left for you to do.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.756
You know what it is.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.116
You better take it before
your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.996
is bared to the nation."

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.436
But the important thing is,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.140
Dr. King was not abnormal.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.860
Every one of us has something
that we want to hide from somebody.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.636
And even more important,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.140
J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.836
The history of surveillance abuses

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.260
is not the history
of one bad, megalomaniacal man.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.916
Throughout his decades at the FBI,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.676
J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support
of the presidents that he served,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.980
Democratic and Republican alike.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.836
After all, it was John F. Kennedy
and his brother Robert Kennedy

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.820
who knew about and approved
the surveillance of Dr. King.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.876
Hoover ran a program
called COINTELPRO for 15 years

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.676
which was designed
to spy on and undermine civic groups

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.436
that were devoted
to things like civil rights,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.196
the Women's Rights Movement,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.956
and peace groups and anti-war movements.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.339
And the surveillance didn't stop there.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.476
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.516
during the election campaign,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.516
had the campaign airplane
of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.340
as part of his effort
to win that election.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.700
And then, of course, there was Watergate.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.796
Burglars were caught

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.676
breaking into the Democratic
National Committee headquarters

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.236
at the Watergate Hotel,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.436
the Nixon administration was involved
in covering up the burglary,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.940
and eventually Nixon
had to step down as president.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.596
COINTELPRO and Watergate
were a wake-up call for Americans.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.476
Surveillance was out of control

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.340
and it was being used
to squelch political challengers.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.596
And so Americans rose to the occasion

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.060
and what we did was
we reformed surveillance law.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.356
And the primary tool we used
to reform surveillance law

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.076
was to require a search warrant

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.060
for the government to be able to get
access to our phone calls and our letters.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.396
Now, the reason why
a search warrant is important

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.756
is because it interposes a judge

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.396
in the relationship
between investigators and the citizens,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.396
and that judge's job is to make sure

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.036
that there's good cause
for the surveillance,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.476
that the surveillance
is targeted at the right people,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.996
and that the information that's collected

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.636
is going to be used
for legitimate government purposes

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.596
and not for discriminatory ones.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.836
This was our system,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.116
and what this means is

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.956
that President Obama
did not wiretap Trump Tower.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.796
The system is set up to prevent
something like that from happening

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.660
without a judge being involved.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.900
But what happens when we're not talking
about phone calls or letters anymore?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.036
Today, we have technology

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.236
that makes it cheap and easy
for the government to collect information

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.940
on ordinary everyday people.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.076
Your phone call records

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.716
can reveal whether you have an addiction,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.196
what your religion is,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.876
what charities you donate to,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.380
what political candidate you support.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.956
And yet, our government
collected, dragnet-style,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.940
Americans' calling records for years.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.276
In 2012, the Republican
National Convention

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.676
highlighted a new technology
it was planning to use,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.196
facial recognition,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.196
to identify people
who were going to be in the crowd

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.676
who might be activists or troublemakers

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.260
and to stop them ahead of time.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.716
Today, over 50 percent of American adults

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.140
have their faceprint
in a government database.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.036
The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.596
concocted a plan

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.156
to find out what Americans
were going to gun shows

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.676
by using license plate detectors

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.796
to scan the license plates of cars

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.060
that were in the parking lots
of these events.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.116
Today, we believe that over 70 percent
of police departments

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.236
have automatic license plate
detection technology

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.700
that they're using to track people's cars
as they drive through town.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.396
And all of this information,

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.356
the license plates, the faceprints,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.956
the phone records,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.796
your address books, your buddy lists,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.236
the photos that you upload
to Dropbox or Google Photos,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.236
and sometimes even
your chats and your emails

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.820
are not protected
by a warrant requirement.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:11.156
So what that means is we have
all of this information on regular people

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.380
that's newly available
at very low expense.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.940
It is the golden age for surveillance.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.596
Now, every parent is going
to understand what this means.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.756
When you have a little baby

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.716
and the baby's young,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.996
that child is not able
to climb out of its crib.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.916
But eventually your little girl gets older

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.876
and she's able to climb out of the crib,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.676
but you tell her,
"Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.876
And every parent knows
what's going to happen.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.900
Some of those babies
are going to climb out of the crib.

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:50.036
Right? That's the difference
between ability and permission.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.676
Well, the same thing is true
with the government today.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.475
It used to be that our government
didn't have the ability

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:59.076
to do widespread, massive surveillance
on hundreds of millions of Americans

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.660
and then abuse that information.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.196
But now our government has grown up,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.180
and we have that technology today.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.596
The government has the ability,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.196
and that means the law
is more important than ever before.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.956
The law is supposed to say

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.996
when the government
has permission to do it,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.156
and it's supposed to ensure
that there's some kind of ramification.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.676
We notice when those laws are broken

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.396
and there's some of kind of
ramification or punishment.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.836
The law is more important than ever
because we are now living in a world

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.956
where only rules
are stopping the government

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.420
from abusing this information.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.260
But the law has fallen down on the job.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.596
Particularly since September 11
the law has fallen down on the job,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.300
and we do not have
the rules in place that we need.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.660
And we are seeing
the ramifications of that.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.276
So fusion centers
are these joint task forces

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.596
between local, state
and federal government

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.836
that are meant to ferret out
domestic terrorism.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.356
And what we've seen
is fusion center reports

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.156
that say that you might be dangerous

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.116
if you voted for a third-party candidate,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.316
or you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.100
or you watched movies that are anti-tax.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.476
These same fusion centers have spied
on Muslim community groups' reading lists

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.820
and on Quakers who are resisting
military recruiting in high schools.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.676
The Internal Revenue Service
has disproportionately audited

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.356
groups that have "Tea Party"
or "Patriot" in their name.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.956
And now customs and border patrol

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.756
is stopping people
as they come into the country

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.956
and demanding our social
networking passwords

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.556
which will allow them
to see who our friends are,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.796
what we say

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.540
and even to impersonate us online.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.996
Now, civil libertarians like myself

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.156
have been trying to draw
people's attention to these things

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.756
and fighting against them for years.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.980
This was a huge problem
during the Obama administration,

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.060
but now the problem is worse.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.796
When the New York Police Department

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.516
spies on Muslims

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.396
or a police department
uses license plate detectors

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.316
to find out where
the officers' spouses are

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.596
or those sorts of things,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.060
that is extremely dangerous.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.796
But when a president repurposes the power

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.316
of federal surveillance
and the federal government

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.396
to retaliate against political opposition,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.620
that is a tyranny.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.620
And so we are all activists now,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.780
and we all have something
to fear from surveillance.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.356
But just like in the time
of Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.460
we can reform the way things are.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.140
First of all, use encryption.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.836
Encryption protects your information

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.676
from being inexpensively
and opportunistically collected.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.820
It rolls back the golden age
for surveillance.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.660
Second, support surveillance reform.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.716
Did you know that if you have a friend

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.836
who works for the French
or German governments

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.996
or for an international human rights group

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.396
or for a global oil company

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.380
that your friend is a valid
foreign intelligence target?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.876
And what that means is that when
you have conversations with that friend,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.060
the US government
may be collecting that information.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.396
And when that information is collected,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.596
even though it's
conversations with Americans,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.716
it can then be funneled to the FBI

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.196
where the FBI is allowed
to search through it

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.596
without getting a warrant,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.276
without probable cause,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.516
looking for information about Americans

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.956
and whatever crimes we may have committed

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.020
with no need to document
any kind of suspicion.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.716
The law that allows some of this to happen

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.836
is called Section 702
of the FISA Amendments Act,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.396
and we have a great opportunity this year,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.156
because Section 702
is going to expire at the end of 2017,

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.796
which means that
Congress's inertia is on our side

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.396
if we want reform.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.116
And we can pressure our representatives

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.636
to actually implement
important reforms to this law

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.020
and protect our data
from this redirection and misuse.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.396
And finally, one of the reasons
why things have gotten so out of control

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.316
is because so much
of what happens with surveillance --

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.876
the technology, the enabling rules
and the policies

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.476
that are either there
or not there to protect us --

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.916
are secret or classified.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.156
We need transparency,
and we need to know as Americans

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.716
what the government is doing in our name

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.316
so that the surveillance that takes place
and the use of that information

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.820
is democratically accounted for.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.316
We are all activists now,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.980
which means that we all have something
to worry about from surveillance.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.956
But like in the time
of Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.276
there is stuff that we can do about it.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.220
So please join me, and let's get to work.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.036
Thank you.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.820
(Applause)
