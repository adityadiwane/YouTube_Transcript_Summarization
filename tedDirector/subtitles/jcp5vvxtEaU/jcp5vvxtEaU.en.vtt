00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
We lived on less than a dollar a day

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
for about 15 years.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I got a scholarship, went to university,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and decided I was going to give back.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I was going to work with small farmers.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I was going to help alleviate poverty.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I was going to work on international development,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and then I took a turn

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and ended up here.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
you don't always end up in a place like this.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
You could be in New York.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
What I found was,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I started working with refugees and famine victims --

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
small farmers, all, or nearly all --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
who had been dispossessed and displaced.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Now, what I'd been trained to do

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
was methodological research on such people.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
So I did it: I found out how many women

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
had been raped en route to these camps.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I found out how many people had been put in jail,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
how many family members had been killed.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I assessed how long they were going to stay

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and how much it would take to feed them.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And I got really good at predicting

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
how many body bags you would need

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
for the people who were going to die in these camps.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Now this is God's work, but it's not my work.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's not the work I set out to do.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in 1988.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I met a guy -- the guy on the left.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
His name was Ben.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
"I make ice cream."

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So I said, "Well, you've got to make

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
a rainforest ice cream.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
to show that forests are worth more as forests

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
than they are as pasture."

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
He said, "Okay."

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Within a year,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It was a great success.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
by buying on 30 days and selling on 21.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
That gets your adrenaline going.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because we were credit-worthy at that point.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
of the global Brazil-nut market.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We paid two to three times more than anybody else.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
because we would buy it otherwise.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
A great success.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
generated 100 million in sales.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
It failed.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Why did it fail?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
We were attacking the wrong driver.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
We needed to be working on beef.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
We needed to be working on lumber.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
We needed to be working on soy --

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
things that we were not focused on.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
So let's go back to Sudan.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I often talk to refugees:

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
"Why was it that the West didn't realize

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that famines are caused by policies and politics,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
not by weather?"

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And this farmer said to me, one day,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
something that was very profound.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
(Laughter)

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Okay. Fast forward.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
We live on a planet.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
There's just one of them.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
We've got to wake up to the fact

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that we don't have any more

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and that this is a finite planet.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
We know the limits of the resources we have.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
We may be able to use them differently.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We may have some innovative, new ideas.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
But in general, this is what we've got.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
There's no more of it.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Population times consumption

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and right now, it's a simple "not equal."

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Our work shows that we're living

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
at about 1.3 planets.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Since 1990,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
we crossed the line

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Now we're at 1.3.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
This is where we stand today.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
A lot of people like to point

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
to some place else as the cause of the problem.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
It's always population growth.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Population growth's important,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
but it's also about how much each person consumes.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So when the average American

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
consumes 43 times as much

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
as the average African,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
we've got to think that consumption is an issue.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It's not just about population,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and it's not just about them; it's about us.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But it's not just about people;

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
it's about lifestyles.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
There's very good evidence --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
again, we don't necessarily have

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
a peer-reviewed methodology

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that's bulletproof yet --

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
but there's very good evidence

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
that the average cat in Europe

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
than the average African.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
You think that's not an issue going forward?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
You think that's not a question

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
as to how we should be using the Earth's resources?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Let's go back and visit our equation.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
They were consuming what they were consuming --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
let's say one unit of consumption each.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
We have six billion units of consumption.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
By 2050,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
scientists, again, agree --

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
because income is going to grow in developing countries

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
five times what it is today --

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
on global average, about [2.9].

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Who have you heard talking lately

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that's said we have to triple production

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
of goods and services?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But that's what the math says.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
We're not going to be able to do that.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
We can get productivity up.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We can get efficiency up.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But we've also got to get consumption down.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
We need to use less

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
to make more.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And then we need to use less again.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And then we need to consume less.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
All of those things are part of that equation.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
But it basically raises a fundamental question:

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
should consumers have a choice

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
about sustainability, about sustainable products?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
sitting next to one that isn't,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
how do you make that happen?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Okay, so let's be generous.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
How do you evaluate all the scientific data

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
around a product,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
How do you get informed?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You don't.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Here's a little question.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
From a greenhouse gas perspective,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
is lamb produced in the U.K.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
better than lamb produced in New Zealand,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
frozen and shipped to the U.K.?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
better or worse than

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
a bad grazing operation for beef?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Do organic potatoes

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
actually have fewer toxic chemicals

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
used to produce them

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
than conventional potatoes?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
In every single case,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the answer is "it depends."

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
It depends on who produced it and how,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
in every single instance.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And there are many others.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
They're not.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
They may have a lot of opinions about it,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
but they're not going to be terribly informed.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
It's got to be something we all care about.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And we need collusion.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
We need groups to work together that never have.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
We need Cargill to work with Bunge.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
We need Coke to work with Pepsi.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Everybody's got to work together --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
China and the U.S.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We need to begin to manage this planet

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
as if our life depended on it,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
because it does,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
it fundamentally does.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
But we can't do everything.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Even if we get everybody working on it,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
we've got to be strategic.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
We need to focus on the where,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
the what and the who.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So, the where:

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
We have to work in these places.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
of preserving biodiversity as we know it.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
We looked at the threats to these places.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
These are the 15 commodities

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that fundamentally pose the biggest threats

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
to these places

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
because of deforestation,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
soil loss, water use, pesticide use,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
over-fishing, etc.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So we've got 35 places,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
we've got 15 priority commodities,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
who do we work with

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
to change the way those commodities are produced?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
350 major languages --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
a lot of work there.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
I don't see anybody actually being able

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
to do that very effectively.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Again, a daunting task.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
There must be a better way.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
300 to 500 companies

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
control 70 percent or more

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
of the trade of each of the 15 commodities

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that we've identified as the most significant.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
If we work with those, if we change those companies

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and the way they do business,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
then the rest will happen automatically.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So, we went through our 15 commodities.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
This is nine of them.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
We lined them up side-by-side,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and we put the names of the companies that work

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
on each of those.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And if you go through the first 25 or 30 names

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
of each of the commodities,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
what you begin to see is,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
there's Cargill everywhere.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
We said: if we take the top hundred companies,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
what percentage

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
of all 15 commodities

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
do they touch, buy or sell?

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And what we found is it's 25 percent.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
So 100 companies

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
control 25 percent of the trade

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
of all 15 of the most significant

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
commodities on the planet.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
We can get our arms around a hundred companies.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
A hundred companies, we can work with.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
Why is 25 percent important?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Because if these companies demand sustainable products,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Companies can push producers

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
faster than consumers can.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
By companies asking for this,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
we can leverage production so much faster

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
than by waiting for consumers to do it.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
After 40 years, the global organic movement

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
has achieved 0.7 of one percent

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
of global food.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
We can't wait that long.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
We don't have that kind of time.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
We need change

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that's going to accelerate.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Even working with individual companies

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
is not probably going to get us there.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
We need to begin to work with industries.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
So we've started roundtables

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
where we bring together the entire value chain,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
from producers

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
all the way to the retailers and brands.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
we bring in researchers and scientists

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
to have an informed discussion --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
sometimes a battle royale --

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
to figure out what are the key impacts

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
of these products,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.260
what is a global benchmark,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
what's an acceptable impact,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and design standards around that.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
It's not all fun and games.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
In salmon aquaculture,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
we kicked off a roundtable

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
almost six years ago.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Eight entities came to the table.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
We eventually got, I think, 60 percent

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
of global production at the table

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
and 25 percent of demand at the table.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And yet, next week, we launch

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
globally verified, vetted and certified

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
standards for salmon aquaculture.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
It can happen.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:33.260
(Applause)

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
So what brings

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
the different entities to the table?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
It's risk and demand.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
For the big companies, it's reputational risk,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
but more importantly,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
they don't care what the price of commodities is.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
They care about availability,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
so the big risk for them is not having product at all.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
For the producers,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that's what brings them to the table.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So it's the demand that brings them to the table.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
The good news is

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
we identified a hundred companies two years ago.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
In the last 18 months, we've signed agreements

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
with 40 of those hundred companies

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
to begin to work with them on their supply chain.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And in the next 18 months,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
we will have signed up to work with another 40,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and we think we'll get those signed as well.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
of these 80 companies together

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
to help twist the arms of the final 20,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
to bring them to the table,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
but we all need to be in this together.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
So we're pulling out all the stops.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
One company we're working with that's begun --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
in baby steps, perhaps --

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
They've funded research that shows

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
that we can double global palm oil production

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and do it all in Borneo alone

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
by planting on land that's already degraded.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
The study shows that the highest net present value

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
for palm oil

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
is on land that's been degraded.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
They're also undertaking a study to look at

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
all of their supplies of palm oil

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
to see if they could be certified

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
under a credible certification program.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Why is Cargill important?

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
of global palm oil.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
If Cargill makes a decision,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
the entire palm oil industry moves,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
That's not insignificant.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
More importantly, Cargill and one other company

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
ship 50 percent of the palm oil

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
that goes to China.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
We don't have to change the way

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
a single Chinese company works

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
if we get Cargill to only send

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
sustainable palm oil to China.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
It's a pre-competitive issue.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
All the palm oil going there is good.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Buy it.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Mars is also on a similar journey.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
but Mars has made sustainability pledges

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
to buy only certified product for all of its seafood.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
because of pet food.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and it all comes from the fact

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
that Mars wants to be in business in the future.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
And what they see is that they need to

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
improve chocolate production.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
On any given plantation,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
so Mars is looking at the genome,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and they're putting it in the public domain

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
because they want everybody to have access to this data,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
because they want everybody to help them

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
What they've realized

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
is that if they can identify the traits

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
on productivity and drought tolerance,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
on 40 percent of the land.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
The rest of the land can be used for something else.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
It's more with less and less again.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
That's what the future has got to be,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and putting it in the public domain is smart.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
but they want to be a chocolate company forever.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Now, the price of food, many people complain about,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
but in fact, the price of food is going down,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
and that's odd because in fact,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
If you take a look just at water,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
what we see is that,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
with four very common products,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
and then you look at how much water input was put into them,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
and then you look at what the farmer was paid.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
If you divide the amount of water

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
into what the farmer was paid,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
the farmer didn't receive enough money

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
That is an externality by definition.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
This is the subsidy from nature.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
with growers in Turkey

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
to sell juice into Europe,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
and they're doing that because they want to have a product

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
that's closer to the European market.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
But they're not just buying the juice;

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
they're also buying the carbon in the trees

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
to get the product into Europe.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
with coffee, with beef.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
back into the price of the commodity.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standards

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
of what the best producers in the world are doing

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
and use that to inform government regulation,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
so we can shift the entire performance curve.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
We can't just focus on identifying the best;

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.260
we've got to move the rest.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
These companies have begun to think differently.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
They're on a journey; there's no turning back.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
We're all on that same journey with them.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
We have to really begin to change

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
the way we think about everything.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
Thank you.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
(Applause)
