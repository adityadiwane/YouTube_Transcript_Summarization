00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:17.676
I grew up with my identical twin,

00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:20.925
who was an incredibly loving brother.

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:24.549
Now, one thing about being a twin is,

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:28.161
it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:32.809
If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie,

00:00:33.723 --> 00:00:35.075
I had questions.

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.517
And clearly, I wasn't starving.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.302
(Laughter)

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:44.996
When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.734
of a different kind;

00:00:46.758 --> 00:00:51.542
and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind.

00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:58.221
I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology,

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:02.499
and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say,

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:06.843
"Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor,"

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.007
as if it should say that on my card.

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.816
[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)]

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.442
(Laughter)

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:19.336
This favoritism we show the body
over the mind --

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.799
I see it everywhere.

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:23.385
I recently was at a friend's house,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.931
and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.560
He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth,

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:33.392
when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell.

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:36.968
He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up,

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:40.506
got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.294
to put one on his cut.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.987
Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces,

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:51.438
but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected,

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:54.798
and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day.

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.345
We all know how to maintain
our physical health

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.884
and how to practice dental hygiene, right?

00:02:00.908 --> 00:02:03.697
We've known it since
we were five years old.

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:09.066
But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health?

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.248
Well, nothing.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.568
What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.945
Nothing.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:23.215
How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:25.379
than we do our minds?

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:31.012
Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.705
than our psychological health?

00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:38.783
We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones,

00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:43.013
injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:45.808
And they can also get worse
if we ignore them,

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.722
and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways.

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.465
And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.382
we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries,

00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:58.962
we don't.

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:01.915
It doesn't even occur to us
that we should.

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:06.491
"Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head."

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.067
Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg:

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.677
"Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg."

00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:14.852
(Laughter)

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.107
It is time we closed the gap

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.219
between our physical
and our psychological health.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.362
It's time we made them more equal,

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:26.203
more like twins.

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:30.921
Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist.

00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:33.376
So he's not a real doctor, either.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.128
(Laughter)

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.680
We didn't study together, though.

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:42.095
In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.865
is move across the Atlantic
to New York City

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.776
to get my doctorate in psychology.

00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:50.661
We were apart then
for the first time in our lives,

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:53.970
and the separation was brutal
for both of us.

00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:57.542
But while he remained
among family and friends,

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.623
I was alone in a new country.

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.971
We missed each other terribly,

00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:05.148
but international phone calls
were really expensive then,

00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:09.601
and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.985
When our birthday rolled around,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.561
it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together.

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:15.914
We decided to splurge,

00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:18.104
and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes.

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:19.421
(Laughter)

00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:23.509
I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call --

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:25.311
and waiting ...

00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:27.280
and waiting.

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:29.248
But the phone didn't ring.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.143
Given the time difference, I assumed,

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.465
"OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later."

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.997
There were no cell phones then.

00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:38.108
But he didn't.

00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:43.675
And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months,

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:47.088
he no longer missed me
the way I missed him.

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.531
I knew he would call in the morning,

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:55.070
but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life.

00:04:56.717 --> 00:04:58.586
I woke up the next morning.

00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:00.335
I glanced down at the phone,

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.113
and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:04.814
when pacing the day before.

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:08.263
I stumbled out of bed,

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.500
I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later.

00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:13.424
And it was my brother,

00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:15.116
and boy, was he pissed.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.344
(Laughter)

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:20.618
It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well.

00:05:21.126 --> 00:05:23.537
Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said,

00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.780
"I don't understand.

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:26.719
If you saw I wasn't calling you,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.559
why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?"

00:05:31.057 --> 00:05:32.237
He was right.

00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:34.354
Why didn't I call him?

00:05:35.187 --> 00:05:36.861
I didn't have an answer then.

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:39.059
But I do today,

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:40.404
and it's a simple one:

00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:42.861
loneliness.

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:47.997
Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound,

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:51.721
one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking.

00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:57.498
It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do.

00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:00.328
It make us really afraid to reach out,

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:04.442
because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache

00:06:04.466 --> 00:06:07.519
when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand?

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:11.515
I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then,

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.408
but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me.

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:19.892
But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively.

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:26.179
It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected

00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:27.361
from those around you.

00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:28.542
And I did.

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.515
There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying.

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.599
Loneliness won't just make you miserable;

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:39.457
it will kill you.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.960
I'm not kidding.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:44.575
Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.495
by 14 percent.

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:48.267
Fourteen percent!

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.595
Loneliness causes high blood pressure,

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.784
high cholesterol.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:56.533
It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system,

00:06:56.557 --> 00:07:00.589
making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases.

00:07:00.613 --> 00:07:04.151
In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together,

00:07:04.175 --> 00:07:07.831
chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:10.624
for your long-term health and longevity

00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:11.996
as cigarette smoking.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:16.571
Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you."

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:18.777
But loneliness doesn't.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.260
And that's why it's so important

00:07:21.284 --> 00:07:24.347
that we prioritize
our psychological health,

00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:27.073
that we practice emotional hygiene.

00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:30.358
Because you can't treat
a psychological wound

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.401
if you don't even know you're injured.

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:36.920
Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound

00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:39.833
that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.803
Failure does that as well.

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:46.081
I once visited a day care center,

00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:50.592
where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.179
You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out.

00:07:55.817 --> 00:08:00.388
One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it,

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:03.206
and then she just sat back
and looked at the box

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.005
with her lower lip trembling.

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:08.080
The little boy next to her
watched this happen,

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:11.939
then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it.

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:16.583
Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of

00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:18.391
until she slid the red button,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:21.893
the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight.

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:26.209
So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys,

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:29.344
but with very different
reactions to failure.

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:33.788
The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button.

00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:37.566
The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.265
was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.624
Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time.

00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:51.181
In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:55.300
that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks.

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:58.180
Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure?

00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:00.009
You need to be.

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:04.406
Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.939
and you believe it,

00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:09.237
then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless

00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:12.520
and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all.

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:15.943
And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed.

00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:20.561
You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential.

00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:24.235
Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:27.687
convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.160
Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind.

00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:37.674
I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother.

00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:41.366
We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.070
when a police car stopped us.

00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:46.657
There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects.

00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:50.425
The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver,

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.847
then on my brother in the front seat,

00:09:53.285 --> 00:09:54.451
and then on me.

00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:56.859
And his eyes opened wide and he said,

00:09:57.283 --> 00:09:59.124
"Where have I seen your face before?"

00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:01.761
(Laughter)

00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:03.226
And I said,

00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:05.358
"In the front seat."

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:07.869
(Laughter)

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:10.525
But that made no sense to him whatsoever,

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:12.488
so now he thought I was on drugs.

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.072
(Laughter)

00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:16.667
So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me,

00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:18.518
he marches me over to the police car,

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:22.042
and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record,

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:25.576
could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.189
But even as we were driving away,

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:31.201
you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:33.269
that I was getting away with something.

00:10:33.293 --> 00:10:34.955
(Laughter)

00:10:35.293 --> 00:10:38.645
Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced.

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:42.109
So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:43.820
and defeated after you fail.

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:48.218
But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed.

00:10:48.242 --> 00:10:51.090
You have to fight
feelings of helplessness.

00:10:51.114 --> 00:10:54.369
You have to gain control
over the situation.

00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:56.985
And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:58.228
before it begins.

00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:00.167
[Stop Emotional Bleeding]

00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:02.602
Our minds and our feelings --

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:05.967
they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were.

00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:08.833
They're more like a really moody friend,

00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:13.540
who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next.

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:17.858
I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:20.287
and an extremely ugly divorce,

00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.548
was finally ready for her first date.

00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:24.595
She had met this guy online,

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:27.049
and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful,

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:30.605
and most importantly,
he seemed really into her.

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:33.387
So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress,

00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.002
and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink.

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:41.447
Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says,

00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:43.330
"I'm not interested," and walks out.

00:11:45.798 --> 00:11:48.913
Rejection is extremely painful.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.646
The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:53.801
All she could do was call a friend.

00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:58.388
Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect?

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:02.088
You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say.

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:05.027
Why would a handsome,
successful man like that

00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.259
ever go out with a loser like you?"

00:12:09.092 --> 00:12:12.103
Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel?

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:15.133
But it would be much less shocking

00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:17.623
if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that.

00:12:17.957 --> 00:12:19.976
It's what the woman said to herself.

00:12:20.893 --> 00:12:22.714
And that's something we all do,

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:25.227
especially after a rejection.

00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:28.696
We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.886
what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.265
We call ourselves names.

00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:34.775
Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.

00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:36.896
And it's interesting that we do,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.783
because our self-esteem
is already hurting.

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:42.761
Why would we want to go
and damage it even further?

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:45.858
We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose.

00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:48.784
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know --

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:52.344
I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it."

00:12:52.368 --> 00:12:55.949
But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time.

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:59.068
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.

00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:02.140
Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health.

00:13:02.862 --> 00:13:06.422
We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower,

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:09.907
you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety;

00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:12.605
that failures and rejections hurt more,

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:14.912
and it takes longer to recover from them.

00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:18.759
So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing

00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:20.844
is to revive your self-esteem,

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:23.827
not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.936
When you're in emotional pain,

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:30.497
treat yourself with the same compassion

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.154
you would expect from a truly good friend.

00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:35.249
[Protect Your Self-Esteem]

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:39.574
We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them.

00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:43.816
And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination.

00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:46.728
To ruminate means to chew over.

00:13:46.752 --> 00:13:48.941
It's when your boss yells at you

00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:51.586
or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.859
or you have big fight with a friend

00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:57.944
and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days,

00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:00.357
sometimes for weeks on end.

00:14:00.494 --> 00:14:05.493
Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit,

00:14:05.517 --> 00:14:06.966
and it's a very costly one,

00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:12.151
because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts,

00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:15.124
you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk

00:14:15.148 --> 00:14:16.885
for developing clinical depression,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.636
alcoholism,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.822
eating disorders,

00:14:19.846 --> 00:14:21.952
and even cardiovascular disease.

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:23.874
The problem is,

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:27.839
the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important,

00:14:27.863 --> 00:14:29.946
so it's a difficult habit to stop.

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.427
I know this for a fact,

00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:35.987
because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.101
You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.109
His cancer was extremely aggressive.

00:14:45.133 --> 00:14:48.199
He had visible tumors all over his body.

00:14:48.904 --> 00:14:52.260
And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy.

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:57.677
And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through.

00:14:58.586 --> 00:15:01.306
I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering,

00:15:02.322 --> 00:15:05.591
even though he never complained, not once.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.997
He had this incredibly positive attitude.

00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:11.508
His psychological health was amazing.

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:16.327
I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess.

00:15:17.303 --> 00:15:18.544
But I knew what to do.

00:15:18.568 --> 00:15:23.219
Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient

00:15:23.243 --> 00:15:25.697
to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.758
And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought,

00:15:29.782 --> 00:15:34.137
I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed.

00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:38.626
And within one week,
my whole outlook changed

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.378
and became more positive and more hopeful.

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.243
[Battle Negative Thinking]

00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:47.710
Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan,

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:50.524
and I was by his side
when he got the results.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:52.964
All the tumors were gone.

00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:57.271
He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go,

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:58.875
but we knew he would recover.

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.518
This picture was taken two weeks ago.

00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:08.312
By taking action when you're lonely,

00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:11.698
by changing your responses to failure,

00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.621
by protecting your self-esteem,

00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:16.927
by battling negative thinking,

00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:20.180
you won't just heal
your psychological wounds,

00:16:20.204 --> 00:16:22.763
you will build emotional resilience,

00:16:22.787 --> 00:16:24.015
you will thrive.

00:16:24.664 --> 00:16:28.700
A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene,

00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:33.518
and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent

00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:35.260
in just a matter of decades.

00:16:35.947 --> 00:16:40.036
I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.369
if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene.

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:46.257
Can you imagine
what the world would be like

00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:48.817
if everyone was psychologically healthier?

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.762
If there were less loneliness
and less depression?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.807
If people knew how to overcome failure?

00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:58.489
If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered?

00:16:58.513 --> 00:17:00.914
If they were happier and more fulfilled?

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.037
I can, because that's the world
I want to live in.

00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.707
And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well.

00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:15.271
And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well --

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:18.358
that's the world we can all live in.

00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:20.539
Thank you very much.
