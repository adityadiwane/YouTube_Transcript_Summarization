00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:15.067
I've been intrigued by this question

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.518
of whether we could evolve
or develop a sixth sense --

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:23.136
a sense that would give us seamless access

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.136
and easy access to meta-information
or information that may exist somewhere

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.136
that may be relevant to help us
make the right decision

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
about whatever it is
that we're coming across.

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:38.136
And some of you may argue,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.422
"Well, don't today's cell phones
do that already?"

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:43.136
But I would say no.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.136
When you meet someone here at TED --

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.199
and this is the top networking place,
of course, of the year --

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:51.081
you don't shake somebody's hand

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:53.136
and then say,
"Can you hold on for a moment

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.246
while I take out my phone and Google you?"

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.136
Or when you go to the supermarket

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.969
and you're standing there
in that huge aisle

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:04.509
of different types of toilet papers,

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.136
you don't take out your cell phone,
and open a browser,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.136
and go to a website to try to decide
which of these different toilet papers

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.220
is the most ecologically
responsible purchase to make.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:21.136
So we don't really have easy access
to all this relevant information

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.130
that can just help us
make optimal decisions

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:28.307
about what to do next
and what actions to take.

00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:31.136
And so my research group at the Media Lab

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.020
has been developing a series of inventions

00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:40.621
to give us access to this information
in a sort of easy way,

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:45.617
without requiring that the user
changes any of their behavior.

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:50.136
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.136
and most successful effort so far,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.970
which is still very much
a work in process.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:02:00.136
I'm actually wearing the device right now
and we've sort of cobbled it together

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.818
with components that are off the shelf --

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:08.737
and that, by the way, only cost
350 dollars at this point in time.

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:12.719
I'm wearing a camera,
just a simple web cam,

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:18.490
a portable, battery-powered
projection system with a little mirror.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:22.585
These components communicate
to my cell phone in my pocket

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.890
which acts as the communication
and computation device.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.834
And in the video here we see
my student Pranav Mistry,

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.136
who's really the genius
who's been implementing

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.527
and designing this whole system.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:41.136
And we see how this system
lets him walk up to any surface

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.136
and start using his hands
to interact with the information

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.852
that is projected in front of him.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:51.974
The system tracks
the four significant fingers.

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:55.664
In this case, he's wearing
simple marker caps

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:57.136
that you may recognize.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.850
But if you want a more stylish version,

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:03.551
you could also paint your nails
in different colors.

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:07.136
And the camera basically
tracks these four fingers

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.999
and recognizes any gestures
that he's making

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:15.525
so he can just go to,
for example, a map of Long Beach,

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.787
zoom in and out, etc.

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:23.905
The system also recognizes iconic gestures
such as the "take a picture" gesture,

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.347
and then takes a picture
of whatever is in front of you.

00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.136
And when he then walks
back to the Media Lab,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.605
he can just go up to any wall

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.541
and project all the pictures
that he's taken,

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.136
sort through them and organize them,
and re-size them, etc.,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.984
again using all natural gestures.

00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:47.067
So, some of you most likely
were here two years ago

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:51.345
and saw the demo by Jeff Han,
or some of you may think,

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.740
"Well, doesn't this look like
the Microsoft Surface Table?"

00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:59.136
And yes, you also interact
using natural gestures,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.136
both hands, etc.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.136
But the difference here
is that you can use any surface,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.136
you can walk up to any surface,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.136
including your hand,
if nothing else is available,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.657
and interact with this projected data.

00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:18.136
The device is completely
portable, and can be --

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.900
(Applause)

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:25.541
(Applause ends)

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:29.136
So, one important difference
is that it's totally mobile.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.894
Another even more important
difference is that in mass production,

00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:37.583
this would not cost more tomorrow
than today's cell phones

00:04:37.607 --> 00:04:41.585
and would actually not
sort of be a bigger packaging --

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:43.631
could look a lot more stylish

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:46.753
than this version
that I'm wearing around my neck.

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:53.039
But other than letting some of you
live out your fantasy

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:56.994
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise
in "Minority Report,"

00:04:57.018 --> 00:05:01.036
the reason why we're really
excited about this device

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.892
is that it really can act
as one of these sixth-sense devices

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:12.168
that gives you relevant information
about whatever is in front of you.

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:16.136
So we see Pranav here
going into the supermarket

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.500
and he's shopping for some paper towels.

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:21.428
And, as he picks up a product,

00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:24.506
the system can recognize
the product that he's picking up,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.766
using either image recognition
or marker technology,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.764
and give him the green light
or an orange light.

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:34.698
He can ask for additional information.

00:05:34.722 --> 00:05:38.483
So this particular choice here

00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:42.136
is a particularly good choice,
given his personal criteria.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.136
Some of you may want the toilet paper
with the most bleach in it

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.731
rather than the most ecologically
responsible choice.

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:52.908
(Laughter)

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:57.640
If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
he can get an Amazon rating --

00:05:57.664 --> 00:06:00.276
it gets projected
right on the cover of the book.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.136
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.868
which gets a great rating,
by the way, at Amazon.

00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:09.136
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.892
and can then see additional
information about the book --

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:19.136
reader comments, maybe sort of information
by his favorite critic, etc.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.136
If he turns to a particular page,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.453
he finds an annotation by maybe
an expert or a friend of ours

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:28.299
that gives him a little bit
of additional information

00:06:28.323 --> 00:06:31.348
about whatever is on that particular page.

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:35.749
Reading the newspaper --
it never has to be outdated.

00:06:35.773 --> 00:06:37.136
(Laughter)

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.949
You can get video annotations
of the events that you're reading about.

00:06:41.973 --> 00:06:45.136
You can get the latest sports scores, etc.

00:06:46.044 --> 00:06:48.136
This is a more controversial one.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.811
(Laughter)

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.136
As you interact with someone at TED,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.136
maybe you can see
a word cloud of the tags,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.888
the words that are associated
with that person

00:06:58.912 --> 00:07:01.660
in their blog and personal web pages.

00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:06.837
In this case, the student
is interested in cameras, etc.

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.817
On your way to the airport,

00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:12.910
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can
tell you that your flight is delayed,

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:15.570
that the gate has changed, etc.

00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:18.714
And, if you need to know
what the current time is,

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:22.136
it's as simple as drawing a watch --

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.365
(Laughter)

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:24.524
(Applause)

00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:26.136
on your arm.

00:07:27.774 --> 00:07:34.136
So that's where we're at so far
in developing this sixth sense

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.886
that would give us seamless access
to all this relevant information

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.728
about the things that we may come across.

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:46.146
My student Pranav, who's really,
like I said, the genius behind this.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.422
(Applause and cheering)

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:08.136
(Applause ends)

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.136
He does deserve a lot of applause,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.508
because I don't think he's slept much
in the last three months, actually.

00:08:15.532 --> 00:08:18.934
And his girlfriend is probably
not very happy about him either.

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.813
But it's not perfect yet,
it's very much a work in progress.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.770
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years

00:08:26.794 --> 00:08:31.136
we'll be here with the ultimate
sixth sense brain implant.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.207
Thank you.

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.350
(Applause)
