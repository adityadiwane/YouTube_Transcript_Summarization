00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.586
Whoa, dude.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.826
(Laughter)

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.690
Check out those killer equations. Sweet.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.986
Actually, for the next 18 minutes
I'm going to do the best I can

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
to describe the beauty
of particle physics without equations.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.650
It turns out there's a lot
we can learn from coral.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.146
A coral is a very beautiful
and unusual animal.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.706
Each coral head consists
of thousands of individual polyps.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.266
These polyps are continually
budding and branching

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.170
into genetically identical neighbors.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.186
If we imagine this
to be a hyperintelligent coral,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.386
we can single out an individual
and ask him a reasonable question.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.786
We can ask how exactly
he got to be in this particular location

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.506
compared to his neighbors --

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.090
if it was just chance,
or destiny, or what?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.490
Now, after admonishing us
for turning the temperature up too high,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.146
he would tell us that our question
was completely stupid.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.170
These corals can be kind of mean, you see,

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:19.052
and I have surfing scars to prove that.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.786
But this polyp would continue and tell us

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.866
that his neighbors were
quite clearly identical copies of him.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.226
That he was in all
these other locations as well,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.410
but experiencing them
as separate individuals.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.946
For a coral, branching
into different copies

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.828
is the most natural thing in the world.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.026
Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.850
would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.906
The mathematics of quantum mechanics

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.466
very accurately describes
how our universe works.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.348
And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities,

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:51.572
just like a coral.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.546
It's a weird thing for us humans
to wrap our minds around,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.426
since we only ever get
to experience one possibility.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.450
This quantum weirdness was first described

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.226
by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.946
The cat likes this version better.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.330
(Laughter)

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.426
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box
with a radioactive sample

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.346
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,
branches into a state

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.210
in which it is radiated
and a state in which it is not.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.946
(Laughter)

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.986
In the branch in which
the sample radiates,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.386
it sets off a trigger that releases poison
and Schrödinger is dead.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.306
But in the other branch of reality,
he remains alive.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.235
These realities are experienced
separately by each individual.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.186
As far as either can tell,
the other one doesn't exist.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.426
This seems weird to us,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.306
because each of us
only experiences an individual existence,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.426
and we don't get to see other branches.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.746
It's as if each of us,
like Schrödinger here,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.930
are a kind of coral
branching into different possibilities.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.346
The mathematics
of quantum mechanics tells us

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.666
this is how the world
works at tiny scales.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.650
It can be summed up in a single sentence:

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.666
Everything that can happen, does.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.146
That's quantum mechanics.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.906
But this does not mean everything happens.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.330
The rest of physics is about describing
what can happen and what can't.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.426
What physics tells us
is that everything comes down to geometry

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.570
and the interactions
of elementary particles.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.650
And things can happen only if
these interactions are perfectly balanced.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.986
Now I'll go ahead and describe
how we know about these particles,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.050
what they are and how this balance works.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.386
In this machine,
a beam of protons and antiprotons

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.426
are accelerated to near the speed of light

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.106
and brought together in a collision,
producing a burst of pure energy.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.026
This energy is immediately converted
into a spray of subatomic particles,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.346
with detectors and computers
used to figure out their properties.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.626
This enormous machine --

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.826
the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Geneva --

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.546
has a circumference of 17 miles
and, when it's operating,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.170
draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.026
We can't predict specifically

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.986
what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.730
Quantum mechanics tells us
all possibilities are realized.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.050
But physics does tell us
what particles can be produced.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.386
These particles must have
just as much mass and energy

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.770
as is carried in
by the proton and antiproton.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.146
Any particles more massive
than this energy limit aren't produced,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.570
and remain invisible to us.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.226
This is why this new
particle accelerator is so exciting.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.506
It's going to push
this energy limit seven times

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.266
beyond what's ever been done before,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.010
so we're going to get to see
some new particles very soon.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.826
But before talking
about what we might see,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.170
let me describe the particles
we already know of.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.890
There's a whole zoo
of subatomic particles.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.426
Most of us are familiar with electrons.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.666
A lot of people in this room
make a good living pushing them around.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.866
(Laughter)

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.906
But the electron also has
a neutral partner called the neutrino,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.050
with no electric charge
and a very tiny mass.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.186
In contrast, the up and down quarks
have very large masses,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.410
and combine in threes to make
the protons and neutrons inside atoms.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.426
All of these matter particles
come in left- and right-handed varieties,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.212
and have antiparticle partners
that carry opposite charges.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.946
These familiar particles

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.986
also have less familiar
second and third generations,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.530
which have the same charges as the first
but have much higher masses.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.546
These matter particles all interact
with the various force particles.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.786
The electromagnetic force
interacts with electrically charged matter

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.626
via particles called photons.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.186
There is also a very weak force

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.943
called, rather unimaginatively,
the weak force ...

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.106
(Laughter)

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.538
that interacts
only with left-handed matter.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.786
The strong force acts between quarks

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.946
which carry a different kind of charge,
called color charge,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.746
and come in three different varieties:
red, green and blue.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.970
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann
for these names -- they're his fault.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.586
Finally, there's the force of gravity,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.706
which interacts with matter
via its mass and spin.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.946
The most important thing
to understand here

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.770
is that there's a different kind of charge
associated with each of these forces.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.586
These four different forces
interact with matter

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.515
according to the corresponding charges
that each particle has.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.146
A particle that hasn't been seen yet,
but we're pretty sure exists,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.866
is the Higgs particle, which gives masses
to all these other particles.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.026
The main purpose
of the Large Hadron Collider

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.090
is to see this Higgs particle,
and we're almost certain it will.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.330
But the greatest mystery
is what else we might see.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.906
And I'm going to show you
one beautiful possibility

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.311
towards the end of this talk.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.866
Now, if we count up
all these different particles

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.746
using their various spins and charges,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.090
there are 226.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.770
That's a lot of particles
to keep track of.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.426
And it seems strange

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.010
that nature would have
so many elementary particles.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.666
But if we plot them out
according to their charges,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.330
some beautiful patterns emerge.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.730
The most familiar charge
is electric charge.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.826
Electrons have an electric charge,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.066
a negative one,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.106
and quarks have
electric charges in thirds.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.386
So when two up quarks and a down quark
are combined to make a proton,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.426
it has a total
electric charge of plus one.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.706
These particles also have antiparticles,
which have opposite charges.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.546
Now, it turns out the electric charge

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.066
is actually a combination
of two other charges:

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.690
hypercharge and weak charge.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.090
If we spread out
the hypercharge and weak charge

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.426
and plot the charges of particles
in this two-dimensional charge space,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.706
the electric charge
is where these particles sit

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.130
along the vertical direction.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.426
The electromagnetic
and weak forces interact with matter

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.666
according to their hypercharge
and weak charge,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.946
which make this pattern.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.106
This is called
the unified electroweak model,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.330
and it was put together back in 1967.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.906
The reason most of us
are only familiar with electric charge

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.530
and not both of these
is because of the Higgs particle.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.466
The Higgs, over here on the left,
has a large mass

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.946
and breaks the symmetry
of this electroweak pattern.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.546
It makes the weak force very weak
by giving the weak particles a large mass.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.666
Since this massive Higgs sits along
the horizontal direction in this diagram,

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.986
the photons of electromagnetism
remain massless

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.946
and interact with electric charge
along the vertical direction

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.210
in this charge space.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.146
So the electromagnetic and weak forces

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.506
are described by this pattern
of particle charges

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.906
in two-dimensional space.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.450
We can include the strong force
by spreading out its two charge directions

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.626
and plotting the charges
of the force particles in quarks

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.890
along these directions.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.226
The charges of all known particles

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.626
can be plotted in
a four-dimensional charge space,

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.826
and projected down to two dimensions
like this so we can see them.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.626
Whenever particles interact,
nature keeps things in a perfect balance

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.810
along all four of these charge directions.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.506
If a particle and an antiparticle collide,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.186
it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.650
in all four charge directions.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.266
At this point, anything can be created

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.650
as long as it has the same energy
and maintains a total charge of zero.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.706
For example, this weak force particle
and its antiparticle

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.506
can be created in a collision.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.426
In further interactions,
the charges must always balance.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.770
One of the weak particles could decay
into an electron and an antineutrino,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.146
and these three
still add to zero total charge.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.249
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:56.066
So these patterns of charges
are not just pretty.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.586
They tell us what interactions
are allowed to happen.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.225
And we can rotate this charge space
in four dimensions

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.026
to get a better look
at the strong interaction,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.306
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.666
In a strong interaction,
a strong force particle,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.906
such as this one,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.690
interacts with a colored quark,
such as this green one,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.395
to give a quark with a different
color charge -- this red one.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.106
And strong interactions
are happening millions of times

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.266
each second in every atom of our bodies,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.970
holding the atomic nuclei together.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.186
But these four charges
corresponding to three forces

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.610
are not the end of the story.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.186
We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.506
When we include these,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.186
each matter particle
has two different spin charges,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.186
spin-up and spin-down.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.266
So they all split and give a nice pattern
in six-dimensional charge space.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.266
We can rotate this pattern
in six dimensions

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.810
and see that it's quite pretty.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.066
Right now, this pattern
matches our best current knowledge

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.490
of how nature is built at the tiny scales
of these elementary particles.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.986
This is what we know for certain.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.146
Some of these particles
are at the very limit

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.546
of what we've been able to reach
with experiments.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.786
From this pattern

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.146
we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales --

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.050
the way the universe works
at these tiny scales is very beautiful.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.866
But now I'm going to discuss
some new and old ideas

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.410
about things we don't know yet.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.146
We want to expand this pattern
using mathematics alone,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.786
and see if we can get our hands
on the whole enchilada.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.906
We want to find
all the particles and forces

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.066
that make a complete picture
of our universe.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.746
And we want to use this picture
to predict new particles

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.294
that we'll see when experiments
reach higher energies.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.506
So there's an old idea in particle physics

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.266
that this known pattern of charges,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.866
which is not very symmetric,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.746
could emerge from a more perfect pattern
that gets broken --

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.786
similar to how the Higgs particle
breaks the electroweak pattern

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.466
to give electromagnetism.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.546
In order to do this,
we need to introduce new forces

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.890
with new charge directions.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.506
When we introduce a new direction,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.946
we get to guess what charges
the particles have along this direction,

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.090
and then we can rotate it
in with the others.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.546
If we guess wisely,
we can construct the standard charges

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.266
in six charge dimensions
as a broken symmetry

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.690
of this more perfect pattern
in seven charge dimensions.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.346
This particular choice
corresponds to a grand unified theory

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.050
introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.506
When we look at this new unified pattern,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.490
we can see a couple of gaps
where particles seem to be missing.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.530
This is the way
theories of unification work.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.826
A physicist looks for larger,
more symmetric patterns

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.170
that include the established
pattern as a subset.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.146
The larger pattern allows us
to predict the existence of particles

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.410
that have never been seen.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.826
This unification model
predicts the existence

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.346
of these two new force particles,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.010
which should act a lot
like the weak force, only weaker.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.226
Now, we can rotate this set
of charges in seven dimensions

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.810
and consider an odd fact
about the matter particles:

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.986
the second and third generations of matter

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.906
have exactly the same charges
in six-dimensional charge space

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.170
as the first generation.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.890
These particles are not
uniquely identified by their six charges.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.490
They sit on top of one another
in the standard charge space.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.346
However, if we work
in eight-dimensional charge space,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.970
then we can assign
unique new charges to each particle.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.090
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.770
and see what the whole pattern looks like.

00:12:30.313 --> 00:12:33.266
Here we can see the second
and third generations of matter now,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.410
related to the first generation
by a symmetry called "triality."

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.346
This particular pattern
of charges in eight dimensions

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.890
is actually part of the most beautiful
geometric structure in mathematics.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.170
It's a pattern of the largest
exceptional Lie group, E8.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.066
This Lie group is a smooth,
curved shape with 248 dimensions.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.066
Each point in this pattern
corresponds to a symmetry

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.130
of this very complex and beautiful shape.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.866
One small part of this E8 shape
can be used to describe

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.506
the curved space-time
of Einstein's general relativity,

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.770
explaining gravity.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.226
Together with quantum mechanics,

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.706
the geometry of this shape
could describe everything

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.346
about how the universe works
at the tiniest scales.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.666
The pattern of this shape living
in eight-dimensional charge space

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.970
is exquisitely beautiful,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.826
and it summarizes thousands
of possible interactions

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.546
between these elementary particles,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.210
each of which is just a facet
of this complicated shape.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.746
As we spin it, we can see
many of the other intricate patterns

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.010
contained in this one.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.586
And with a particular rotation,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.786
we can look down through this pattern
in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.626
and see all the particles at once.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.226
It's a very beautiful object,

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.626
and as with any unification,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.010
we can see some holes where new particles
are required by this pattern.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.906
There are 20 gaps
where new particles should be,

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.666
two of which have been filled
by the Pati-Salam particles.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.946
From their location in this pattern,
we know that these new particles

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.306
should be scalar fields
like the Higgs particle,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.010
but have color charge
and interact with the strong force.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.106
Filling in these new particles
completes this pattern,

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.466
giving us the full E8.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.506
This E8 pattern has
very deep mathematical roots.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.010
It's considered by many to be the most
beautiful structure in mathematics.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.746
It's a fantastic prospect that this object
of great mathematical beauty

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.106
could describe the truth
of particle interactions

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.770
at the smallest scales imaginable.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.986
And this idea that nature is described
by mathematics is not at all new.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.730
In 1623, Galileo wrote this:

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.386
"Nature's grand book,
which stands continually open to our gaze,

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.906
is written in the language of mathematics.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.546
Its characters are triangles,
circles and other geometrical figures,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.426
without which it is humanly impossible
to understand a single word of it;

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.730
without these, one is wandering around
in a dark labyrinth."

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.130
I believe this to be true,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.786
and I've tried
to follow Galileo's guidance

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.146
in describing the mathematics
of particle physics

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.546
using only triangles, circles
and other geometrical figures.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.306
Of course, when other physicists
and I actually work on this stuff,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.530
the mathematics
can resemble a dark labyrinth.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.106
But it's reassuring that at the heart
of this mathematics

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.050
is pure, beautiful geometry.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.226
Joined with quantum mechanics,

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.186
this mathematics describes our universe
as a growing E8 coral,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.826
with particles interacting
at every location in all possible ways

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.450
according to a beautiful pattern.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.786
And as more of the pattern
comes into view using new machines

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.626
like the Large Hadron Collider,

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.490
we may be able to see whether nature
uses this E8 pattern or a different one.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.330
This process of discovery is
a wonderful adventure to be involved in.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.306
If the LHC finds particles
that fit this E8 pattern,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.930
that will be very, very cool.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.426
If the LHC finds new particles,
but they don't fit this pattern --

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.946
well, that will be very interesting,
but bad for this E8 theory.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.466
And, of course, bad for me personally.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.666
(Laughter)

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.466
Now, how bad would that be?

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.586
Well, pretty bad.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.850
(Laughter)

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.530
But predicting how nature works
is a very risky game.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.490
This theory and others like it
are long shots.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.266
One does a lot of hard work
knowing that most of these ideas

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.466
probably won't end up
being true about nature.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.666
That's what doing
theoretical physics is like:

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.106
there are a lot of wipeouts.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.490
In this regard, new physics theories
are a lot like start-up companies.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.106
As with any large investment,

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.026
it can be emotionally difficult
to abandon a line of research

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.346
when it isn't working out.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.426
But in science,
if something isn't working,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.650
you have to toss it out
and try something else.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.226
Now, the only way to maintain sanity

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.866
and achieve happiness
in the midst of this uncertainty

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.930
is to keep balance
and perspective in life.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.306
I've tried the best I can
to live a balanced life.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.210
(Laughter)

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.466
I try to balance my life equally
between physics, love and surfing --

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.306
my own three charge directions.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.466
(Laughter)

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.186
This way, even if the physics
I work on comes to nothing,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.930
I still know I've lived a good life.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.466
And I try to live in beautiful places.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.546
For most of the past ten years
I've lived on the island of Maui,

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.810
a very beautiful place.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.866
Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries
in the universe to my parents

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.746
how I managed to survive all that time

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.665
without engaging in anything
resembling full-time employment.

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:25.649
(Laughter)

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.169
I'm going to let you in on that secret.

00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:32.850
This was a view
from my home office on Maui.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.090
And this is another,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.466
and another.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.506
And you may have noticed
that these beautiful views are similar,

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.130
but in slightly different places.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.386
That's because this used to be
my home and office on Maui.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.186
(Laughter)

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.850
I've chosen a very unusual life.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.386
But not worrying about rent

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.570
allowed me to spend my time
doing what I love.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.826
Living a nomadic existence
has been hard at times,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.066
but it's allowed me
to live in beautiful places

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.066
and keep a balance in my life
that I've been happy with.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.450
It allows me to spend a lot of my time
hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.346
But I also greatly enjoy
the company of hyperintelligent people.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.751
So I'm very happy
to have been invited here to TED.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.866
Thank you very much.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:25.506
(Applause)

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.316
Chris Anderson: Stay here one second.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.922
(Applause)

00:18:30.946 --> 00:18:32.946
I probably understood two percent of that,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.570
but I still absolutely loved it.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.186
So I'm going to sound dumb.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.546
Your theory of everything --

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.146
Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.426
CA: That's right.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.786
The reason it's got
a few people at least excited

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.186
is because, if you're right, it brings
gravity and quantum theory together.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.026
So are you saying that we should
think of the universe, at its heart --

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.746
that the smallest things that there are,

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:02.946
are somehow an E8 object of possibility?

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.986
I mean, is there a scale to it,
at the smallest scale, or ...?

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.866
GL: Well, right now
the pattern I showed you

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.506
that corresponds to what we know
about elementary particle physics --

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.946
that already corresponds
to a very beautiful shape.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.386
And that's the one
that I said we knew for certain.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.506
And that shape
has remarkable similarities --

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.370
and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,
which could be the rest of the picture.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.906
And these patterns of points
that I've shown for you

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.746
actually represent symmetries
of this high-dimensional object

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.546
that would be warping
and moving and dancing

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.666
over the space-time that we experience.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.346
And that would be what explains all these
elementary particles that we see.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.746
CA: But a string theorist,
as I understand it,

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.786
explains electrons in terms
of much smaller strings vibrating --

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.106
I know, you don't like string theory --
vibrating inside it.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.946
How should we think
of an electron in relation to E8?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.370
GL: Well, it would be one
of the symmetries of this E8 shape.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.506
So what's happening is, as the shape
is moving over space-time, it's twisting.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.986
And the direction it's twisting
as it moves is what particle we see.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.226
So it would be --

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.426
CA: The size of the E8 shape,
how does that relate to the electron?

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.666
I feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.167
GL: As far as we know,
electrons are point particles,

00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:24.026
so this would be going down
to the smallest possible scales.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.866
So the way these things are explained
in quantum field theory is,

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.546
all possibilities are expanding
and developing at once.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.610
And this is why
I use the analogy to coral.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.730
And --

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.226
in this way, the way that E8 comes in

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.690
is it will be as a shape that's attached
at each point in the space-time.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.066
And, as I said,
the way the shape twists --

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.586
the directional along which way
the shape is twisting

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.666
as it moves over this curved surface --

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.466
is what the elementary particles
are, themselves.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.146
So through quantum field theory,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.386
they manifest themselves as points
and interact that way.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.946
I don't know if I'll be able
to make this any clearer.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.906
(Laughter)

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.346
CA: It doesn't really matter.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.386
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.186
and I certainly
want to understand more of this.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.346
But thank you so much for coming.
That was absolutely fascinating.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.210
(Applause)
