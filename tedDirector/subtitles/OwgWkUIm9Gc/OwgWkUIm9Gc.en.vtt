00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.025
One day in 1819,

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:20.784
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:23.714
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.754
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:29.934
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.835
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.164
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:39.477
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.740
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.963
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:47.167
In their small boats, they carried only

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.733
rudimentary navigational equipment

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.381
and limited supplies of food and water.

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.585
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:57.240
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.189
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.115
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.340
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.252
No search party was coming to look for these men.

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:11.114
So most of us have never experienced a situation

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:14.617
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:16.484
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:18.778
We know how fear feels,

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.882
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:22.527
what our fears mean.

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:25.364
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:28.277
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:31.095
like baby teeth or roller skates.

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:33.590
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.197
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.936
are hard-wired to be optimists.

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:41.719
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.697
as a danger in and of itself.

00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:46.694
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:49.343
In English, fear is something we conquer.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:53.176
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:55.381
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:59.524
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

00:01:59.524 --> 00:02:01.902
something that can be as profound and insightful

00:02:01.902 --> 00:02:04.556
as storytelling itself?

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:07.149
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.428
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:12.709
When I was a child, I lived in California,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.398
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:19.406
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.447
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:24.880
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.055
during every minor earthquake,

00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:29.358
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.879
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.751
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:37.979
is that they have a vivid imagination.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.369
But at a certain point, most of us learn

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.255
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:46.012
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:48.992
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:52.400
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.511
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:59.372
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:02.229
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.568
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:10.024
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.953
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:16.257
from visionaries and young children?

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:19.117
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:22.804
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:24.923
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:28.679
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.228
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:34.931
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.657
but they had very few options.

00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:40.088
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:42.828
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:47.228
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:49.528
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:53.304
were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.

00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:55.826
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.504
They'd been told that these islands,

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:01.748
and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.

00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:04.124
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:05.765
and eaten for dinner.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.517
Another possible destination was Hawaii,

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:10.389
but given the season, the captain was afraid

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.610
they'd be struck by severe storms.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.402
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:21.026
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:22.915
a certain band of winds that could eventually

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:25.179
push them toward the coast of South America.

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:27.900
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.411
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.817
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:38.178
to starve to death before reaching land.

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.570
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.469
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.123
would govern whether they lived or died.

00:04:47.123 --> 00:04:51.333
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.611
What if instead of calling them fears,

00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:55.222
we called them stories?

00:04:55.222 --> 00:04:57.455
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

00:04:57.455 --> 00:05:00.515
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:03.445
that we are all born knowing how to do.

00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:06.208
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:08.073
They have the same architecture.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:10.750
Like all stories, fears have characters.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.173
In our fears, the characters are us.

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:17.475
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:21.591
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:24.159
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.508
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:30.464
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.671
sinking into human skin,

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:35.725
human flesh roasting over a fire.

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:38.461
Fears also have suspense.

00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:40.751
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.259
you should be wondering what happened

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.360
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.605
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:52.158
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention

00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:56.097
on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:

00:05:56.097 --> 00:05:58.854
What will happen next?

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:01.558
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

00:06:01.558 --> 00:06:03.576
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable

00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:05.246
of thinking about the future in this way,

00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:08.137
of projecting ourselves forward in time,

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:10.549
and this mental time travel is just one more thing

00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:14.171
that fears have in common with storytelling.

00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:16.664
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:18.547
is learning to predict how one event in a story

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:20.291
will affect all the other events,

00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:22.340
and fear works in that same way.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.517
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:30.163
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:33.124
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:36.313
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.205
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

00:06:39.205 --> 00:06:41.248
What would happen to our minds?

00:06:41.248 --> 00:06:44.354
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:46.475
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:48.712
as a child frightened in the night.

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:51.243
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:55.109
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:59.809
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:02.312
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:05.239
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:07.470
as the authors of those stories.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.432
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

00:07:09.432 --> 00:07:11.936
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:16.271
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.272
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.193
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:24.819
and the author found that these people shared a habit

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.178
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:30.699
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.362
these people read them closely, they studied them,

00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:36.962
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

00:07:36.962 --> 00:07:38.879
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:40.957
their businesses were ready.

00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:45.308
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.

00:07:45.308 --> 00:07:48.467
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:53.389
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.784
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears

00:07:56.784 --> 00:07:59.182
that our imaginations concoct.

00:07:59.182 --> 00:08:01.166
So how can we tell the difference between

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:04.986
the fears worth listening to and all the others?

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:07.463
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex

00:08:07.463 --> 00:08:11.746
offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.

00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:16.473
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

00:08:16.473 --> 00:08:20.346
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:22.673
and instead embarked on the longer

00:08:22.673 --> 00:08:25.800
and much more difficult route to South America.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.270
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.349
as they knew they might,

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:33.044
and they were still quite far from land.

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:35.931
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:40.417
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:45.320
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.683
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"

00:08:48.683 --> 00:08:52.563
wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,

00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:55.187
"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex

00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:57.876
might in all human probability have been avoided

00:08:57.876 --> 00:09:00.443
had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,

00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:02.324
steered straight for Tahiti.

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:06.889
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:09.935
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals

00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:14.124
so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?

00:09:14.124 --> 00:09:15.991
Why were they swayed by one story

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.630
so much more than the other?

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.152
Looked at from this angle,

00:09:20.152 --> 00:09:23.451
theirs becomes a story about reading.

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:26.107
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.906
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:31.756
the artistic and the scientific.

00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:34.260
A good reader has an artist's passion,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.683
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

00:09:36.683 --> 00:09:38.794
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:42.005
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.496
which acts to temper and complicate

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:46.894
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:50.099
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:53.739
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:57.728
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.

00:09:57.728 --> 00:09:59.852
Of all the narratives their fears wrote,

00:09:59.852 --> 00:10:03.503
they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:06.722
the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.673
cannibals.

00:10:08.673 --> 00:10:10.954
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears

00:10:10.954 --> 00:10:14.435
more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.195
they would have listened instead to the less violent

00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:20.483
but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,

00:10:20.483 --> 00:10:26.063
and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.

00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:28.931
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,

00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:30.908
we too would be less often swayed

00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:32.784
by the most salacious among them.

00:10:32.784 --> 00:10:34.452
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about

00:10:34.452 --> 00:10:36.640
serial killers and plane crashes,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.506
and more time concerned with the subtler

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:40.560
and slower disasters we face:

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.308
the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:45.851
the gradual changes in our climate.

00:10:45.851 --> 00:10:49.500
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.948
so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.

00:10:53.948 --> 00:10:56.845
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:59.777
of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,

00:10:59.777 --> 00:11:02.012
a way of glimpsing what might be the future

00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:05.447
when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:08.843
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious

00:11:08.843 --> 00:11:11.000
as our favorite works of literature:

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.045
a little wisdom, a bit of insight

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:16.619
and a version of that most elusive thing --

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:17.870
the truth.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.901
Thank you. (Applause)
