00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:17.106
Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:21.594
made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:25.698
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:29.154
all harbor resident microbial landscapes.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.914
As we design these things, we could be thinking

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:34.728
about designing these invisible worlds,

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:36.971
and also thinking about how they interact

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:39.727
with our personal ecosystems.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:43.370
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.730
and these creatures define who we are.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.608
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:53.066
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.075
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:57.547
or not,

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.526
and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.594
interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:05.186
So, for example, when you touch a pencil,

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:08.018
microbial exchange happens.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:12.914
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,

00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:15.537
this opens a path to influencing

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:18.928
our health in unprecedented ways.

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:21.392
I get asked all of the time from people,

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:25.462
"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:28.010
And I believe the answer is yes.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.935
I think we're doing it right now,

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.043
but we're doing it unconsciously.

00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:35.008
I'm going to share data with you

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.736
from one aspect of my research focused on architecture

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:41.862
that demonstrates how, through both conscious

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:44.072
and unconscious design,

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:47.081
we're impacting these invisible worlds.

00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:51.310
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.994
and I worked with a team of architects and biologists

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:58.168
to sample over 300 rooms in this building.

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:02.178
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:05.488
and to do this, we sampled dust.

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:09.396
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.800
broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.527
This means that people in my group

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:17.840
were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.360
This is a picture of Tim, who,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.814
right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:25.384
he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.355
I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:32.112
and things have changed dramatically for me."

00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:35.864
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.940
and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.480
that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.952
The way that you look at this data is,

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:48.530
first, look around the outside of the circle.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.552
You'll see broad bacterial groups,

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:54.392
and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,

00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:57.408
it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.

00:02:57.408 --> 00:02:59.904
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of

00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:02.465
alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:06.660
you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.023
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.045
If you look inside the restrooms,

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:16.175
they all have really similar ecosystems,

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.503
and if you were to look inside the classrooms,

00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:21.369
those also have similar ecosystems.

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.783
But if you look across these space types,

00:03:23.783 --> 00:03:26.180
you can see that they're fundamentally different

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.335
from one another.

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:31.328
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.815
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:37.854
it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:42.377
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:46.589
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:50.016
because you can bring on principles of ecology,

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:52.928
and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,

00:03:52.928 --> 00:03:55.655
the way organisms move around.

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:59.839
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:00.910
and by air.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.747
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building

00:04:03.747 --> 00:04:05.600
was look at the air system.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.832
Mechanical engineers design air handling units

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.024
to make sure that people are comfortable,

00:04:11.024 --> 00:04:13.577
that the air flow and temperature is just right.

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:17.121
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:21.495
but they could also be using biology.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.607
If you look at the microbes

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:26.657
in one of the air handling units in this building,

00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:30.648
you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:34.183
And if you compare this to the microbes

00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:36.327
in a different air handling unit,

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:39.039
you'll see that they're fundamentally different.

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.590
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.447
and what that means is that mechanical engineers

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:48.123
are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability

00:04:48.123 --> 00:04:53.707
to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:57.815
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.982
and designers often cluster rooms together

00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:03.037
to facilitate interactions among people,

00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:06.509
or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.183
Given that microbes travel around with people,

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.856
you might expect to see rooms that are close together

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:14.111
have really similar biomes.

00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.591
And that is exactly what we found.

00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:19.758
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.957
they have very similar ecosystems,

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:25.096
but if you go to an office

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:28.144
that is a farther walking distance away,

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.880
the ecosystem is fundamentally different.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.425
And when I see the power that dispersal has

00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:37.705
on these biogeographic patterns,

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:40.264
it makes me think that it's possible

00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:44.000
to tackle really challenging problems,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.461
like hospital-acquired infections.

00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:49.067
I believe this has got to be, in part,

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:52.710
a building ecology problem.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.502
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:59.967
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.508
He's an architect,

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:06.841
and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.

00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:09.785
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:12.881
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.057
to study in a quantitative way

00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:17.633
how his design choices impacted

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.593
the ecology and biology of this building,

00:06:20.593 --> 00:06:25.102
he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:26.970
He went from thinking just about energy

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.458
to also starting to think about human health.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:34.319
He helped design some of the air handling systems

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.513
in this building and the way it was ventilated.

00:06:36.513 --> 00:06:39.235
So what I'm first going to show you is

00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:42.794
air that we sampled outside of the building.

00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:46.961
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities

00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:50.937
in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.

00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:53.925
Next I'm going to show you what happened

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:57.574
when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.

00:06:57.574 --> 00:06:59.189
We blocked them off at night

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.455
so that they got no ventilation.

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.632
A lot of buildings are operated this way,

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.383
probably where you work,

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.354
and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:12.281
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant

00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:15.340
until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.922
When you walked into those rooms,

00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.897
they smelled really bad,

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.999
and our data suggests that it had something to do with

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:25.066
leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:27.745
from people the day before.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:29.917
Contrast this to rooms

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:34.198
that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy

00:07:34.198 --> 00:07:37.978
where air came in from the outside through louvers.

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:42.775
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,

00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:44.910
and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.021
He felt like he had made a good choice

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:48.755
with the design process

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:51.150
because it was both energy efficient

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.439
and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:59.481
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,

00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:01.994
but they're relevant to the design of anything.

00:08:01.994 --> 00:08:06.164
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want

00:08:06.164 --> 00:08:07.582
in a plane

00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:10.515
or on a phone.

00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.969
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:15.849
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:18.033
to both ward off pathogens

00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:20.178
and give you good breath.

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:26.197
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:28.567
A conscious approach to design,

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:31.448
I'm calling it bioinformed design,

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:32.934
and I think it's possible.

00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:34.372
Thank you.

00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:38.125
(Applause)
