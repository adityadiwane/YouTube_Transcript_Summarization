00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.641
Someone who looks like me
walks past you in the street.

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:20.751
Do you think they're a mother,

00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:22.199
a refugee

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.253
or a victim of oppression?

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.454
Or do you think they're a cardiologist,

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:27.496
a barrister

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.285
or maybe your local politician?

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:32.283
Do you look me up and down,

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:33.775
wondering how hot I must get

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:37.504
or if my husband has forced me
to wear this outfit?

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.261
What if I wore my scarf like this?

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.763
I can walk down the street
in the exact same outfit

00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.420
and what the world expects of me
and the way I'm treated

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.771
depends on the arrangement
of this piece of cloth.

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.885
But this isn't going to be
another monologue about the hijab

00:00:55.885 --> 00:00:59.861
because Lord knows, Muslim women
are so much more than the piece of cloth

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:03.820
they choose, or not,
to wrap their head in.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.564
This is about looking beyond your bias.

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:10.084
What if I walked past you and later on

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:13.678
you'd found out that actually
I was a race car engineer,

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:17.122
and that I designed my own race car
and I ran my university's race team,

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.627
because it's true.

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:24.127
What if I told you that I was actually
trained as a boxer for five years,

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:25.654
because that's true, too.

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:29.038
Would it surprise you?

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:30.527
Why?

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.319
Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.347
that surprise and the behaviors
associated with it

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:39.000
are the product of something 
called unconscious bias,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.372
or implicit prejudice.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:43.613
And that results in the
ridiculously detrimental

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.351
lack of diversity in our workforce,

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:47.714
particularly in areas of influence.

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:50.246
Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.318
(Applause)

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:55.327
Let me just set something out
from the outset:

00:01:55.327 --> 00:01:58.689
Unconscious bias is not the same
as conscious discrimination.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.199
I'm not saying that in all of you, 
there's a secret sexist or racist

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:04.841
or ageist lurking within, 
waiting to get out.

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.578
That's not what I'm saying.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:08.530
We all have our biases.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.869
They're the filters through which
we see the world around us.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.844
I'm not accusing anyone,

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.338
bias is not an accusation.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:17.879
Rather, it's something that 
has to be identified,

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.082
acknowledged and mitigated against.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.476
Bias can be about race,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.680
it can be about gender.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.383
It can also be about class,
education, disability.

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:30.406
The fact is, we all have biases
against what's different,

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:33.335
what's different to our social norms.

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:36.359
The thing is, if we want 
to live in a world

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.494
where the circumstances of your birth

00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:41.935
do not dictate your future

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:44.140
and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.697
then each and every one of us
has a role to play

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:50.960
in making sure unconscious bias
does not determine our lives.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.909
There's this really famous experiment
in the space of unconscious bias

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.637
and that's in the space of gender
in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:03.672
So orchestras, back in the day,
were made up mostly of dudes,

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:06.473
up to only five percent were female.

00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:09.741
And apparently, that was because
men played it differently,

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:12.555
presumably better, presumably.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:15.517
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra

00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:17.282
started an experiment.

00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:19.125
They started blind auditions.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.954
So rather than face-to-face auditions,
you would have to play behind a screen.

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:24.466
Now funnily enough,

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:26.754
no immediate change was registered

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:29.890
until they asked the audition-ers
to take their shoes off

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.578
before they entered the room.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.618
because the clickity-clack 
of the heels

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:35.559
against the hardwood floors

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.828
was enough to give the ladies away.

00:03:37.828 --> 00:03:39.334
Now get this,

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.196
there results of the audition showed

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.196
that there was a 50 percent
increased chance

00:03:44.196 --> 00:03:47.126
a woman would progress past
the preliminary stage.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:51.580
And it almost tripled 
their chances of getting in.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.093
What does that tell us?

00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:56.929
Well, unfortunately for the guys,
men actually didn't play differently,

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.829
but there was the perception
that they did.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.146
And it was that bias that was
determining their outcome.

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:06.244
So what we're doing here 
is identifying and acknowledging

00:04:06.244 --> 00:04:07.292
that a bias exists.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.910
And look, we all do it.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.697
Let me give you an example.

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:14.475
A son and his father are in 
a horrible car accident.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:16.339
The father dies on impact

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.999
and the son, who's severely injured,
is rushed to hospital.

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.381
The surgeon looks at the son
when they arrive and is like,

00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.788
"I can't operate."

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:27.694
Why?

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:30.900
"The boy is my son."

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.248
How can that be?

00:04:32.248 --> 00:04:33.468
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:36.334
the surgeon is his mother.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:38.077
Now hands up -- and it's okay --

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.837
but hands up if you initially assumed
the surgeon was a guy?

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.838
There's evidence that
that unconscious bias exists,

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:48.870
but we all just have
to acknowledge that it's there

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.554
and then look at ways 
that we can move past it

00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:54.258
so that we can look at solutions.

00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:57.075
Now one of the interesting things

00:04:57.075 --> 00:05:00.357
around the space of unconscious bias
is the topic of quotas.

00:05:00.357 --> 00:05:02.682
And this something 
that's often brought up.

00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:05.993
And of of the criticisms 
is this idea of merit.

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:09.165
Look, I don't want to be picked 
because I'm a chick,

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:11.432
I want to be picked because 
I have merit,

00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:13.608
because I'm the best person for the job.

00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:16.507
It's a sentiment that's pretty common
among female engineers

00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:18.413
that I work with and that I know.

00:05:18.413 --> 00:05:20.314
And yeah, I get it, I've been there.

00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:22.653
But, if the merit idea was true,

00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:27.420
why would identical resumes, 
in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.014
identical resumes sent out
for a lab technician,

00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:35.230
why would Jennifers
be deemed less competent,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.494
be less likely to be offered the job,

00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:41.171
and be paid less than Johns.

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:43.624
The unconscious bias is there,

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.060
but we just have to look at
how we can move past it.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.681
And, you know, it's interesting,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.494
there's some research that talks about

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:52.346
why this is the case and
it's called the merit paradox.

00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:54.867
And in organizations --
and this is kind of ironic --

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:58.694
in organizations that talk about merit
being their primary value-driver

00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:00.066
in terms of who they hire,

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.561
they were more likely to hire dudes
and more likely to pay the guys more

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:07.168
because apparently merit 
is a masculine quality.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.430
But, hey.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.744
So you guys think you've got 
a good read on me,

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:14.175
you kinda think you know what's up.

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:17.748
Can you imagine me running one of these?

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:20.035
Can you imagine me walking in
and being like,

00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:23.140
"Hey boys, this is what's up.
This is how it's done."

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.680
Well, I'm glad you can.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.163
(Applause)

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:40.310
Because ladies and gentlemen,
that's my day job.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.247
And the cool thing about it is
that it's pretty entertaining.

00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:44.935
Actually, in places like Malaysia,

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:47.395
Muslim women on rigs 
isn't even comment-worthy.

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:48.764
There are that many of them.

00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:49.992
But, it is entertaining.

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:52.049
I remember, I was telling one of the guys,

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:54.620
"Hey, mate, look, I really want 
to learn how to surf."

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.181
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't
know how you can surf

00:06:57.181 --> 00:06:59.552
with all that gear you've got on,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:02.226
and I don't know any women-only beaches."

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:04.510
And then, the guy came up 
with a brilliant idea,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.768
he was like, "I know, you run
that organization

00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:08.628
Youth Without Borders, right?

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:13.282
Why don't you start a clothing line
for Muslim chicks in beaches.

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:15.919
You can call it 
Youth Without Boardshorts."

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.435
(Laughter)

00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:19.250
And I was like, "Thanks, guys."

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.356
And I remember another bloke 
telling me that

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:24.169
I should eat all the yogurt I could

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.387
because that was the only culture 
I was going to get around there.

00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:32.366
But, the problem is, it's kind of true

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:35.704
because there's an intense 
lack of diversity in our workforce,

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:37.992
particularly in places of influence.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.352
Now, in 2010, 

00:07:39.352 --> 00:07:41.825
The Australian National University
did an experiment

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:45.431
where they sent out
4,000 identical applications

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:48.963
to entry level jobs, essentially.

00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:53.177
To get the same number of interviews
as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,

00:07:53.177 --> 00:07:57.674
if you were Chinese, you had 
to send out 68 percent more applications.

00:07:57.674 --> 00:08:00.368
If you were Middle Eastern --
Abdel-Magied --

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:02.418
you had to send out 64 percent,

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:04.581
and if you're Italian, 
you're pretty lucky,

00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:07.142
you only have to send out 12 percent more.

00:08:07.142 --> 00:08:10.151
In places like Silicon Valley,
it's not that much better.

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:12.448
In Google, they put out 
some diversity results

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:19.390
and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian
and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.717
all that kind of thing.

00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:23.345
And the rest of the tech world
is not that much better

00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:24.677
and they've acknowledged it,

00:08:24.677 --> 00:08:27.225
but I'm not really sure
what they're doing about it.

00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.445
The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:31.203
In a study done by Green Park,

00:08:31.203 --> 00:08:35.275
who are a British senior exec supplier,

00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:39.738
they said that over half
of the FTSE 100 companies

00:08:39.738 --> 00:08:42.138
don't have a nonwhite leader
at their board level,

00:08:42.138 --> 00:08:43.593
executive or non-executive.

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:47.686
And two out of every three
don't have an executive

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.956
who's from a minority.

00:08:49.956 --> 00:08:52.778
And most of the minorities 
that are at that sort of level

00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:54.420
are non-executive board directors.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.086
So their influence isn't that great.

00:08:57.086 --> 00:08:59.301
I've told you a bunch of terrible things.

00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:02.722
You're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that?
What can I do about it?"

00:09:03.662 --> 00:09:05.815
Well, fortunately,

00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:07.857
we've identified that there's a problem.

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:12.793
There's a lack of opportunity,
and that's due to unconscious bias.

00:09:13.713 --> 00:09:15.672
But you might be sitting 
there thinking,

00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:19.482
"I ain't brown. What's that got
to do with me?"

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:22.466
Let me offer you a solution.

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:23.717
And as I've said before,

00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:27.568
we live in a world where
we're looking for an ideal.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.208
And if we want to create a world

00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.809
where the circumstances
of your birth don't matter,

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:33.838
we all have to be part of the solution.

00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:36.913
And interestingly, the author
of the lab resume experiment

00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:38.514
offered some sort of a solution.

00:09:38.514 --> 00:09:42.248
She said the one thing that brought
the successful women together,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.227
the one thing that they had in common,

00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:46.694
was the fact that they had good mentors.

00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:49.139
So mentoring, we've all kind of
heard that before,

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:51.577
it's in the vernacular.

00:09:52.267 --> 00:09:54.661
Here's another challenge for you.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.861
I challenge each and every one of you
to mentor someone different.

00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:00.988
Think about it.

00:10:00.988 --> 00:10:04.034
Everyone wants to mentor someone
who kind of is familiar,

00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:04.893
who looks like us,

00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:06.367
we have shared experiences.

00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:09.028
If I see a Muslim chick 
who's got a bit of attitude,

00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:10.881
I'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."

00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:14.117
You walk into a room and there's someone
who went to the same school,

00:10:14.117 --> 00:10:15.428
you play the same sports,

00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:18.982
there's a high chance that you're
going to want to help that person out.

00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:22.509
But for the person in the room
who has no shared experiences with you

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:25.415
it becomes extremely difficult 
to find that connection.

00:10:25.415 --> 00:10:27.834
The idea of finding someone 
different to mentor,

00:10:27.834 --> 00:10:30.505
someone who doesn't come
from the same background as you,

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.988
whatever that background is,

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:35.336
is about opening doors 
for people who couldn't even get

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.331
to the damn hallway.

00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:41.566
Because ladies and gentlemen,
the world is not just.

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:43.699
People are not born 
with equal opportunity.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:46.986
I was born in one of the poorest
cities in the world, Khartoum.

00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:49.107
I was born brown, I was born female,

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:52.941
and I was born Muslim in a world
that is pretty suspicious of us

00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:56.186
for reasons I can't control.

00:10:56.186 --> 00:11:00.156
However, I also acknowledge the fact
that I was born with privilege.

00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:01.825
I was born with amazing parents,

00:11:01.825 --> 00:11:03.430
I was given an education

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.067
and had the blessing
of migrating to Australia.

00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:08.658
But also, I've been blessed
with amazing mentors

00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:11.674
who've opened doors for me 
that I didn't even know were there.

00:11:11.674 --> 00:11:13.032
A mentor who said to me,

00:11:13.032 --> 00:11:14.635
"Hey, your story's interesting.

00:11:14.635 --> 00:11:17.862
Let's write something about it
so that I can share it with people."

00:11:17.862 --> 00:11:18.868
A mentor who said,

00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:22.219
"I know you're all those things that don't
belong on an Australian rig,

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:23.548
but come on anyway."

00:11:23.548 --> 00:11:25.055
And here I am, talking to you.

00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:26.393
And I'm not the only one.

00:11:26.393 --> 00:11:28.862
There's all sorts of people
in my communities

00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:31.026
that I see have been
helped out by mentors.

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:32.805
A young Muslim man in Sydney

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:35.973
who ended up using his mentor's help

00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:39.476
to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:41.098
and now it's a huge thing.

00:11:41.098 --> 00:11:44.218
And he's able to change the lives
of so many other young people.

00:11:44.218 --> 00:11:45.542
Or a lady here in Brisbane,

00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:47.400
an Afghan lady who's a refugee,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.151
who could barely speak English
when she came to Australia,

00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:52.030
her mentors helped her become a doctor

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.253
and she took our Young Queenslander 
of the Year Award in 2008.

00:11:55.253 --> 00:11:57.526
She's an inspiration.

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:03.976
This is so not smooth.

00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:08.940
This is me.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.812
But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:15.611
and I'm also the woman who was
in the abaya at the beginning.

00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:18.709
Would you have chosen to mentor me
if you had seen me

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:20.962
in one of those other versions
of who I am?

00:12:20.962 --> 00:12:23.470
Because I'm that same person.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.014
We have to look past our unconscious bias,

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:30.206
find someone to mentor who's at
the opposite end of your spectrum

00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:32.591
because structural change takes time,

00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:36.707
and I don't have that level of patience.

00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:38.468
So if we're going to create a change,

00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:40.030
if we're going to create a world

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.286
where we all have
those kinds of opportunities,

00:12:42.286 --> 00:12:44.657
then choose to open doors for people.

00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:48.471
Because you might think that
diversity has nothing to do with you,

00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:50.205
but we are all part of this system

00:12:50.205 --> 00:12:52.301
and we can all be part of that solution.

00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.855
And if you don't know
where to find someone different,

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:56.833
go to the places you wouldn't usually go.

00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.996
If you enroll in
private high school tutoring,

00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.463
go to your local state school

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:03.893
or maybe just drop into your
local refugee tutoring center.

00:13:03.893 --> 00:13:05.616
Or perhaps you work at an office.

00:13:05.616 --> 00:13:08.614
Take out that new grad who looks
totally out of place --

00:13:08.614 --> 00:13:09.942
'cause that was me --

00:13:09.942 --> 00:13:11.270
and open doors for them,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.900
not in a tokenistic way,
because we're not victims,

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.968
but show them the opportunities

00:13:15.968 --> 00:13:18.070
because opening up your world

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.741
will make you realize that 
you have access to doors

00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:22.565
that they didn't even know existed

00:13:22.565 --> 00:13:25.501
and you didn't even know
they didn't have.

00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:28.358
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:31.907
there is a problem in our community
with lack of opportunity,

00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:33.750
especially due to unconscious bias.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.782
But each and every one one of you
has the potential to change that.

00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:40.654
I know you've been given a lot
of challenges today,

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:44.495
but if you can take this one piece
and think about it a little differently,

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:47.736
because diversity is magic.

00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:51.554
And I encourage you to look past
your initial perceptions

00:13:51.554 --> 00:13:53.378
because I bet you,

00:13:53.378 --> 00:13:55.199
they're probably wrong.

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:57.624
Thank you.

00:13:57.624 --> 00:14:01.015
(Applause)
