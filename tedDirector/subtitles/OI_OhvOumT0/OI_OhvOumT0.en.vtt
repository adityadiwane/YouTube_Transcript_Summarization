00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:15.306
So this is a talk about gene drives,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.883
but I'm going to start
by telling you a brief story.

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.844
20 years ago, a biologist
named Anthony James

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:24.187
got obsessed with the idea
of making mosquitos

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.790
that didn't transmit malaria.

00:00:27.683 --> 00:00:31.739
It was a great idea,
and pretty much a complete failure.

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:35.256
For one thing, it turned out
to be really hard

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.287
to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.913
James managed it, finally,
just a few years ago,

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.008
by adding some genes
that make it impossible

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:46.746
for the malaria parasite
to survive inside the mosquito.

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.373
But that just created another problem.

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:52.885
Now that you've got
a malaria-resistant mosquito,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.495
how do you get it to replace
all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?

00:00:58.107 --> 00:00:59.580
There are a couple options,

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:01.627
but plan A was basically to breed up

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.738
a bunch of the new
genetically-engineered mosquitos

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:06.088
release them into the wild

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:08.079
and hope that they pass on their genes.

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:10.787
The problem was that you'd have to release

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:15.111
literally 10 times the number
of native mosquitos to work.

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:17.222
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.325
you release an extra 100,000.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.379
As you might guess,

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:24.157
this was not a very popular strategy
with the villagers.

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:25.331
(Laughter)

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:30.667
Then, last January,
Anthony James got an email

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.642
from a biologist named Ethan Bier.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.259
Bier said that he
and his grad student Valentino Gantz

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:39.227
had stumbled on a tool
that could not only guarantee

00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:41.925
that a particular genetic trait
would be inherited,

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:44.028
but that it would spread
incredibly quickly.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.400
If they were right,
it would basically solve the problem

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:49.805
that he and James had been
working on for 20 years.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.108
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos
to carry the anti-malaria gene

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.291
and also this new tool, a gene drive,

00:01:57.315 --> 00:01:58.806
which I'll explain in a minute.

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:01.839
Finally, they set it up
so that any mosquitos

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:03.801
that had inherited the anti-malaria gene

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:07.824
wouldn't have the usual white eyes,
but would instead have red eyes.

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:10.732
That was pretty much just for convenience

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:13.293
so they could tell just at a glance
which was which.

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:16.949
So they took their two
anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:19.632
and put them in a box
with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:20.830
and let them breed.

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:25.240
In two generations, those had produced
3,800 grandchildren.

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:28.010
That is not the surprising part.

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:30.638
This is the surprising part:

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:33.569
given that you started
with just two red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:34.927
and 30 white-eyed ones,

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.712
you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:41.538
Instead, when James opened the box,

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:44.903
all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:47.355
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.894
he became so excited that he was literally
shouting into the phone.

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:54.049
That's because getting
only red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.021
violates a rule that is the absolute
cornerstone of biology,

00:02:57.045 --> 00:02:58.287
Mendelian genetics.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.081
I'll keep this quick,

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:02.869
but Mendelian genetics
says when a male and a female mate,

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:05.535
their baby inherits half
of its DNA from each parent.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.154
So if our original mosquito was aa
and our new mosquito is aB,

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:10.980
where B is the anti-malarial gene,

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.391
the babies should come out
in four permutations:

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.988
aa, aB, aa, Ba.

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:19.173
Instead, with the new gene drive,

00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:20.709
they all came out aB.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.452
Biologically, that shouldn't
even be possible.

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:25.780
So what happened?

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.153
The first thing that happened

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:31.447
was the arrival of a gene-editing tool
known as CRISPR in 2012.

00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:34.811
Many of you have probably
heard about CRISPR,

00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:38.136
so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR
is a tool that allows researchers

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.739
to edit genes very precisely,
easily and quickly.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:45.262
It does this by harnessing a mechanism
that already existed in bacteria.

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:47.912
Basically, there's a protein
that acts like a scissors

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.170
and cuts the DNA,

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:51.677
and there's an RNA molecule
that directs the scissors

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.419
to any point on the genome you want.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:56.133
The result is basically
a word processor for genes.

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:58.783
You can take an entire gene
out, put one in,

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.252
or even edit just a single
letter within a gene.

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:03.599
And you can do it in nearly any species.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:09.042
OK, remember how I said that gene drives
originally had two problems?

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:12.955
The first was that it was hard
to engineer a mosquito

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.366
to be malaria-resistant.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.517
That's basically gone now,
thanks to CRISPR.

00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:18.879
But the other problem was logistical.

00:04:19.307 --> 00:04:21.109
How do you get your trait to spread?

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:23.672
This is where it gets clever.

00:04:24.943 --> 00:04:28.545
A couple years ago, a biologist
at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.919
wondered what would happen

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:33.570
if you made it so that
CRISPR inserted not only your new gene

00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:36.435
but also the machinery
that does the cutting and pasting.

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:41.073
In other words, what if CRISPR
also copied and pasted itself.

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:45.276
You'd end up with a perpetual
motion machine for gene editing.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.192
And that's exactly what happened.

00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:51.915
This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:55.582
not only guarantees
that a trait will get passed on,

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:58.044
but if it's used in the germline cells,

00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.644
it will automatically copy and paste
your new gene

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:03.314
into both chromosomes
of every single individual.

00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:06.140
It's like a global search and replace,

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:09.385
or in science terms, it makes
a heterozygous trait homozygous.

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:13.656
So, what does this mean?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.404
For one thing, it means we have
a very powerful,

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:19.085
but also somewhat alarming new tool.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.465
Up until now, the fact that gene drives
didn't work very well

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.972
was actually kind of a relief.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.107
Normally when we mess around
with an organism's genes,

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:30.480
we make that thing
less evolutionarily fit.

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.337
So biologists can make
all the mutant fruit flies they want

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:34.614
without worrying about it.

00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:37.645
If some escape, natural selection
just takes care of them.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.973
What's remarkable and powerful
and frightening about gene drives

00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:43.757
is that that will no longer be true.

00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:48.656
Assuming that your trait does not have
a big evolutionary handicap,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.759
like a mosquito that can't fly,

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:54.236
the CRISPR-based gene drive
will spread the change relentlessly

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.266
until it is in every single individual
in the population.

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:01.990
Now, it isn't easy to make
a gene drive that works that well,

00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:04.188
but James and Esvelt think that we can.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.163
The good news is that this opens
the door to some remarkable things.

00:06:09.187 --> 00:06:11.091
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive

00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:13.315
in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.091
the species that transmits malaria,

00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:19.607
researchers estimate that it would spread
to the entire population in a year.

00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:23.047
So in a year, you could virtually
eliminate malaria.

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:27.327
In practice, we're still a few years out
from being able to do that,

00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:30.069
but still, a 1,000 children
a day die of malaria.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:32.283
In a year, that number
could be almost zero.

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:35.862
The same goes for dengue fever,
chikungunya, yellow fever.

00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:38.616
And it gets better.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.691
Say you want to get rid
of an invasive species,

00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:43.838
like get Asian carp
out of the Great Lakes.

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:46.458
All you have to do is release a gene drive

00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:48.799
that makes the fish produce
only male offspring.

00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:53.584
In a few generations,
there'll be no females left, no more carp.

00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:56.687
In theory, this means we could restore
hundreds of native species

00:06:56.711 --> 00:06:58.378
that have been pushed to the brink.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.697
OK, that's the good news,

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.013
this is the bad news.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.098
Gene drives are so effective

00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:10.947
that even an accidental release
could change an entire species,

00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:12.161
and often very quickly.

00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:15.304
Anthony James took good precautions.

00:07:15.328 --> 00:07:17.494
He bred his mosquitos
in a bio-containment lab

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:20.106
and he also used a species
that's not native to the US

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.685
so that even if some did escape,

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:24.724
they'd just die off, there'd be nothing
for them to mate with.

00:07:24.748 --> 00:07:28.771
But it's also true that if a dozen
Asian carp with the all-male gene drive

00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:32.724
accidentally got carried
from the Great Lakes back to Asia,

00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:36.177
they could potentially wipe out
the native Asian carp population.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.842
And that's not so unlikely,
given how connected our world is.

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:43.437
In fact, it's why we have
an invasive species problem.

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:45.080
And that's fish.

00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:48.016
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.000
there's literally no way to contain them.

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:52.135
They cross borders
and oceans all the time.

00:07:53.754 --> 00:07:55.936
OK, the other piece of bad news

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.278
is that a gene drive
might not stay confined

00:07:58.302 --> 00:08:00.115
to what we call the target species.

00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:02.055
That's because of gene flow,

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.676
which is a fancy way of saying
that neighboring species

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.948
sometimes interbreed.

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:09.123
If that happens, it's possible
a gene drive could cross over,

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:11.674
like Asian carp could infect
some other kind of carp.

00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:15.413
That's not so bad if your drive
just promotes a trait, like eye color.

00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:17.684
In fact, there's a decent
chance that we'll see

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:20.279
a wave of very weird fruit flies
in the near future.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.653
But it could be a disaster

00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:25.581
if your drive is deigned
to eliminate the species entirely.

00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:29.879
The last worrisome thing
is that the technology to do this,

00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:33.594
to genetically engineer an organism
and include a gene drive,

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:36.952
is something that basically any lab
in the world can do.

00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:38.316
An undergraduate can do it.

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:42.491
A talented high schooler
with some equipment can do it.

00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:46.835
Now, I'm guessing
that this sounds terrifying.

00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.557
(Laughter)

00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:52.471
Interestingly though,
nearly every scientist I talk to

00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:56.376
seemed to think that gene drives were not
actually that frightening or dangerous.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.028
Partly because they believe
that scientists will be

00:08:59.052 --> 00:09:01.256
very cautious and responsible
about using them.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.294
(Laughter)

00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:03.548
So far, that's been true.

00:09:04.302 --> 00:09:06.998
But gene drives also have
some actual limitations.

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:10.331
So for one thing, they work
only in sexually reproducing species.

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:14.132
So thank goodness, they can't be used
to engineer viruses or bacteria.

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:17.346
Also, the trait spreads
only with each successive generation.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.363
So changing or eliminating a population

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:22.713
is practical only if that species
has a fast reproductive cycle,

00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:25.537
like insects or maybe
small vertebrates like mice or fish.

00:09:26.438 --> 00:09:28.699
In elephants or people,
it would take centuries

00:09:28.723 --> 00:09:31.103
for a trait to spread
widely enough to matter.

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:37.221
Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy
to engineer a truly devastating trait.

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:39.808
Say you wanted to make a fruit fly

00:09:39.832 --> 00:09:42.387
that feeds on ordinary fruit
instead of rotting fruit,

00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.044
with the aim of sabotaging
American agriculture.

00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:46.598
First, you'd have to figure out

00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:49.394
which genes control
what the fly wants to eat,

00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:51.965
which is already a very long
and complicated project.

00:09:52.489 --> 00:09:55.793
Then you'd have to alter those genes
to change the fly's behavior

00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:57.355
to whatever you'd want it to be,

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.180
which is an even longer
and more complicated project.

00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:01.522
And it might not even work,

00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:04.040
because the genes
that control behavior are complex.

00:10:04.064 --> 00:10:06.072
So if you're a terrorist
and have to choose

00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:08.454
between starting a grueling
basic research program

00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:12.005
that will require years of meticulous
lab work and still might not pan out,

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.376
or just blowing stuff up?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.055
You'll probably choose the later.

00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:17.918
This is especially true
because at least in theory,

00:10:17.942 --> 00:10:21.076
it should be pretty easy
to build what's called a reversal drive.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.798
That's one that basically overwrites
the change made by the first gene drive.

00:10:24.822 --> 00:10:27.116
So if you don't like
the effects of a change,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.973
you can just release a second drive
that will cancel it out,

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.147
at least in theory.

00:10:33.374 --> 00:10:35.096
OK, so where does this leave us?

00:10:36.604 --> 00:10:40.199
We now have the ability
to change entire species at will.

00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:42.183
Should we?

00:10:42.552 --> 00:10:43.917
Are we gods now?

00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:47.305
I'm not sure I'd say that.

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:49.321
But I would say this:

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:52.187
first, some very smart people

00:10:52.211 --> 00:10:55.067
are even now debating
how to regulate gene drives.

00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:58.162
At the same time,
some other very smart people

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:00.297
are working hard to create safeguards,

00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:03.873
like gene drives that self-regulate
or peter out after a few generations.

00:11:04.644 --> 00:11:05.844
That's great.

00:11:06.313 --> 00:11:08.860
But this technology still requires
a conversation.

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:11.789
And given the nature of gene drives,

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:13.503
that conversation has to be global.

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.838
What if Kenya wants to use a drive
but Tanzania doesn't?

00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:20.608
Who decides whether to release
a gene drive that can fly?

00:11:22.874 --> 00:11:24.828
I don't have the answer to that question.

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.626
All we can do going forward, I think,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.484
is talk honestly
about the risks and benefits

00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:32.730
and take responsibility for our choices.

00:11:33.817 --> 00:11:37.730
By that I mean, not just the choice
to use a gene drive,

00:11:37.754 --> 00:11:39.753
but also the choice not to use one.

00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:44.088
Humans have a tendency to assume
that the safest option

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:45.904
is to preserve the status quo.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:48.477
But that's not always the case.

00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.112
Gene drives have risks,
and those need to be discussed,

00:11:53.136 --> 00:11:56.286
but malaria exists now
and kills 1,000 people a day.

00:11:56.977 --> 00:12:00.541
To combat it, we spray pesticides
that do grave damage to other species,

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:02.135
including amphibians and birds.

00:12:03.668 --> 00:12:06.532
So when you hear about gene drives
in the coming months,

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:08.810
and trust me, you will
be hearing about them,

00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:10.378
remember that.

00:12:10.402 --> 00:12:12.422
It can be frightening to act,

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.583
but sometimes, not acting is worse.

00:12:16.746 --> 00:12:24.566
