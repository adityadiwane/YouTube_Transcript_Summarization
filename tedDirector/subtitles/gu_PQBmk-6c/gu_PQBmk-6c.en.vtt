00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
tell a very well known interviewer on television,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I just wish it were more organized."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So ...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If I controlled the Internet,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you could auction your broken heart on eBay.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Take the money; go to Amazon;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If I were in charge of the Internet,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
U-turn on silent treatment,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but I still stretch miles in all directions.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
would be one big website.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That way you could listen to cool music

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
while you pretend to look for a job

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and you're really just chattin' with your pals.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(Laughter)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They would not email you back

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but you'd get an automated reply.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Their name in your inbox

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's all you wanted anyway.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now follow me, OK?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
(Laughter)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
One, two, three.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That is my grandfather.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
He forms an attachment to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
who grows up to be me --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the guy who usually goes too far.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So if I were emperor of the Internet,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But at that point, I would probably

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
already have the lowest possible mortgage

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and the most enlarged possible penis

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Laughter) --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I wouldn't need it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
pop! -- I'd go wireless.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
(Laughter)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you want to bet just how whack and un-PC

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I guess it's just like life.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It is not a question of if you can --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it's: do ya?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We can interfere with the interface.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
every lucky time we log on.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You don't say a prayer.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You don't write a psalm.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You don't chant an "om."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Thank you, TED.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Applause)
