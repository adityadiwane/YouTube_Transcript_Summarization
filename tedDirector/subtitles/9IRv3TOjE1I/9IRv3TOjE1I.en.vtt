00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm here today to share with you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
an extraordinary journey -

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
extraordinarily rewarding journey,
actually -

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
which brought me into

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
training rats

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
to save human lives

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
by detecting landmines

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and tuberculosis.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
As a child, I had two passions.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
One was a passion for rodents.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I had all kinds of rats,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
mice, hamsters,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
gerbils, squirrels.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
(Laughter)

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I also had a passion for Africa.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Growing up in a multicultural environment,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
we had African students in the house,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and I learned about their stories,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
so different backgrounds,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
dependency on imported know-how,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
goods, services,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
exuberant cultural diversity.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Africa was truly fascinating for me.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
I became an industrial engineer,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
engineer in product development,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
actually the first appropriate technologies

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
for developing countries.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
I started working in the industry,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
but I wasn't really happy to contribute

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to a material consumer society

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
in a linear, extracting

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and manufacturing mode.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
landmines.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
We're talking '95 now.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Princess Diana is announcing on TV

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that landmines form a structural barrier

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to any development, which is really true.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
As long as these devices are there,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
or there is suspicion of landmines,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
you can't really enter into the land.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
for new detectors

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
sustainable in the environments

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
where they're needed to produce,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
which is mainly in the developing world.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
We chose rats.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Why would you choose rats?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Because, aren't they vermin?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Well, actually rats are,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in contrary to what most people think about them,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
rats are highly sociable creatures.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And actually, our product -- what you see here.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
There's a target somewhere here.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
You see an operator, a trained African

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
with his rats in front

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
who actually are left and right.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
There, the animal finds a mine.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
It scratches on the soil.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And the animal comes back for a food reward.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Very, very simple.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Very sustainable in this environment.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Here, the animal gets its food reward.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And that's how it works.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Very, very simple.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Now why would you use rats?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Rats have been used since the '50s last century,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
in all kinds of experiments.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Rats have more genetic material

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
allocated to olfaction

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
than any other mammal species.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
They're extremely sensitive to smell.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and to communicate about it.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Now how do we communicate with rats?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Well don't talk rat,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
but we have a clicker,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
a standard method for animal training,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
which you see there.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
A clicker, which makes a particular sound

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Once the animal knows click, food,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
click, food, click, food --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
so click is food --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
we bring it in a cage with a hole,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and actually the animal learns

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to stick the nose in the hole

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
under which a target scent is placed,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and to do that for five seconds --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
five seconds, which is long for a rat.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
It learns how to find the target smell

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Then the animal learns

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
to walk on a leash in the open

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and find targets.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
In the next step, animals learn

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to find real mines in real minefields.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
They are tested and accredited

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
according to International Mine Action Standards,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
just like dogs have to pass a test.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
This consists of 400 square meters.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
There's a number of mines

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
placed blindly,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and the team of trainer and their rat

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
have to find all the targets.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
If the animal does that, it gets a license

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
as an accredited animal

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
to be operational in the field --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
just like dogs, by the way.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Maybe one slight difference:

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
we can train rats at a fifth of the price

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
of training the mining dog.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
This is our team in Mozambique:

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
one Tanzanian trainer,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
who transfers the skills

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
to these three Mozambican fellows.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
They have a skill,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
which makes them much less dependent

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
on foreign aid.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Moreover, this small team

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and the manual de-miners to follow-up.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
But with this small investment in a rat capacity,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
we have demonstrated in Mozambique

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
up to 60 percent

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
of what is currently normal --

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and we can still bring that price down.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Question of scale.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
If you can bring in more rats,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
we can actually make the output even bigger.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Eleven African governments

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
have seen that they can become less dependent

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
by using this technology.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
They have signed the pact for peace

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and treaty in the Great Lakes region,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
and they endorse hero rats

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to clear their common borders of landmines.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But let me bring you to a very different problem.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And there's about 6,000 people last year

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that walked on a landmine,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
but worldwide last year,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
as a first cause of infection.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Especially in Africa

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.260
there is a huge common problem.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
It means that, if you have T.B.,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
you have more chance that you won't be detected,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And if, however,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
you are detected very early, diagnosed early,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
treatment can start,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
You can actually cure T.B.,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
even in HIV-positives.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So in our common language, Dutch,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
the name for T.B.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
is "tering,"

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
which, etymologically,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
refers to the smell of tar.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Already the old Chinese

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and the Greek, Hippocrates,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
have actually published,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
based on the volatiles

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
exuding from patients.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
So what we did is we collected some samples --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
just as a way of testing --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
from hospitals,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
trained rats on them

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and see if this works,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and wonder, well,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
86 percent specificity

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
using multiple rats in a row.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
This is how it works,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and really, this is a generic technology.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
but can you imagine,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
you can actually put anything under there.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
So how does it work?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
You have a cassette with 10 samples.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Here it's already at the third sample.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
This is a positive sample.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And by doing so, very fast,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
we can have like a second-line opinion

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
to see which patients are positive,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
which are negative.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Just as an indication,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
whereas a microscopist can process

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
40 samples in a day,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
a rat can process

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
the same amount of samples

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
in seven minutes only.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
A cage like this --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.260
(Applause)

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and we have now currently

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
25 tuberculosis rats --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
a cage like this, operating throughout the day,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
can process 1,680 samples.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
environmental detection

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
of pollutants in soils,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
customs applications,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I just want to briefly highlight,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
the blue rods

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
are the scores of microscopy only

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
on a population of 500,000 people,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
where 15,000 reported to get a test done.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and looping those results back,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
we were able to increase case detection rates

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
by over 30 percent.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Throughout last year,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
we've been consistently

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
increasing case detection rates

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
between 30 and 40 percent.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So this is really considerable.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
infects up to 15 people,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
healthy people, per year,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
you can be sure

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that we have saved lots of lives.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
The way forward for us

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
is now to standardize this technology.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And there are simple things

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.260
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
where the animal has to stick for five seconds.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
So, to standardize this.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
Also, to standardize the pellets,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
the food rewards,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and to semi-automate this

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
in order to replicate this on a much larger scale

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and affect the lives of many more people.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Here is a first prototype

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
of our camera rat,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
which is a rat with a rat backpack

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
with a camera that can go under rubble

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
to detect for victims

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
after earthquake and so on.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
This is in a prototype stage.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
We don't have a working system here yet.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
To conclude, I would actually like to say,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
you may think this is about rats, these projects,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
but in the end it is about people.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It is about empowering vulnerable communities

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
to tackle difficult, expensive

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and doing that with a local resource,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
plenty available.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
So something completely different

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
is to keep on challenging your perception

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
about the resources surrounding you,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
whether they are environmental,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
technological, animal, or human.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And to respectfully harmonize with them

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in order to foster a sustainable world.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Thank you very much.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
(Applause)
