00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:15.428
I want you to, for a moment,

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:18.522
think about playing a game of Monopoly.

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:24.508
Except in this game,
that combination of skill, talent and luck

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:27.287
that helped earn you success
in games, as in life,

00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:28.712
has been rendered irrelevant,

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:30.892
because this game's been rigged,

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.391
and you've got the upper hand.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:34.579
You've got more money,

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:37.140
more opportunities to move
around the board,

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.906
and more access to resources.

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:41.268
And as you think about that experience,

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:42.718
I want you to ask yourself:

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:48.152
How might that experience of being
a privileged player in a rigged game

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:50.470
change the way you think about yourself

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.580
and regard that other player?

00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:57.995
So, we ran a study
on the UC Berkeley campus

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.259
to look at exactly that question.

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:03.976
We brought in more than 100 pairs
of strangers into the lab,

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:06.571
and with the flip of a coin,

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.636
randomly assigned one of the two
to be a rich player in a rigged game.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.406
They got two times as much money;

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.561
when they passed Go,
they collected twice the salary;

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.620
and they got to roll
both dice instead of one,

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:21.938
so they got to move
around the board a lot more.

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.568
(Laughter)

00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:25.726
And over the course of 15 minutes,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.241
we watched through
hidden cameras what happened.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:31.353
What I want to do today,
for the first time,

00:01:31.377 --> 00:01:33.525
is show you a little bit of what we saw.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.850
You'll to have to pardon
the sound quality,

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:37.847
because again, these were hidden cameras.

00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:39.556
So we've provided subtitles.

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.266
[Video] Rich Player: How many
500s did you have?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.441
Poor Player: Just one.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:44.885
RP: Are you serious?
PP: Yeah.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.040
RP: I have three. (Laughs)
I don't know why they gave me so much.

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:51.429
Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent
to players that something was up.

00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:54.580
One person clearly has
a lot more money than the other person,

00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:57.160
and yet, as the game unfolded,

00:01:57.184 --> 00:02:01.714
we saw very notable differences,
dramatic differences begin to emerge

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:03.147
between the two players.

00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:07.807
The rich player started to move
around the board louder,

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.855
literally smacking the board
with the piece as he went around.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.586
(Game piece smacks board)

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.559
We were more likely
to see signs of dominance

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:19.596
and nonverbal signs, displays of power

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.294
and celebration among the rich players.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.185
We had a bowl of pretzels
positioned off to the side.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.751
It's on the bottom right corner.

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:31.234
That allowed us to watch
participants' consummatory behavior.

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:34.236
So we're just tracking
how many pretzels participants eat.

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:37.729
[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?

00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:39.297
PP: I don't know.

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:42.828
Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises,
people are on to us.

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:46.344
They wonder what that bowl of pretzels
is doing there in the first place.

00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:48.002
One even asks, like you just saw,

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:50.684
"Is that bowl of pretzels
there as a trick?"

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:54.079
And yet, despite that,
the power of the situation

00:02:54.103 --> 00:02:56.313
seems to inevitably dominate,

00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:59.372
and those rich players
start to eat more pretzels.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:00.782
(Laughter)

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.702
[Video] RP: I love pretzels.

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:07.396
(Laughter)

00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:12.316
Paul Piff: And as the game went on,

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.923
one of the really interesting
and dramatic patterns

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:17.599
that we observed begin to emerge

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:21.056
was that the rich players
actually started to become ruder

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.492
toward the other person --

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:26.705
less and less sensitive to the plight
of those poor, poor players,

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.735
and more and more demonstrative
of their material success,

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:33.741
more likely to showcase
how well they're doing.

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.717
[Video] RP: I have money ...

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:39.637
(Laughs) I have money for everything.

00:03:40.013 --> 00:03:41.486
PP: How much is that?

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.737
RP: You owe me 24 dollars.

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:48.111
You're going to lose all your money soon.

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.271
I'll buy it. I have so much money.

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:52.321
I have so much money, it takes me forever.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:54.434
RP 2: I'm going
to buy out this whole board.

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.539
RP 3: You're going
to run out of money soon.

00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:58.611
I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.

00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:00.223
(Laughter)

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:03.432
Paul Piff: And here's what I think
was really, really interesting:

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:05.646
it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,

00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:09.672
we asked the players to talk
about their experience during the game.

00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:14.733
And when the rich players talked
about why they had inevitably won

00:04:14.757 --> 00:04:16.429
in this rigged game of Monopoly ...

00:04:16.453 --> 00:04:20.527
(Laughter)

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:27.816
They talked about what they'd done
to buy those different properties

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.805
and earn their success in the game.

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:30.863
(Laughter)

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.287
And they became far less attuned

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.823
to all those different
features of the situation --

00:04:35.847 --> 00:04:37.860
including that flip of a coin --

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:42.502
that had randomly gotten them
into that privileged position

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:43.829
in the first place.

00:04:43.853 --> 00:04:46.686
And that's a really,
really incredible insight

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.371
into how the mind
makes sense of advantage.

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:54.279
Now, this game of Monopoly can be used

00:04:54.303 --> 00:04:59.262
as a metaphor for understanding society
and its hierarchical structure,

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:02.903
wherein some people
have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.411
and a lot of people don't;

00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:07.324
they have a lot less wealth
and a lot less status

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:10.396
and a lot less access to valued resources.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.802
And what my colleagues and I
for the last seven years have been doing

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:16.666
is studying the effects
of these kinds of hierarchies.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:21.085
What we've been finding
across dozens of studies

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:24.385
and thousands of participants
across this country

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:28.366
is that as a person's levels
of wealth increase,

00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:32.863
their feelings of compassion
and empathy go down,

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:38.764
and their feelings of entitlement,
of deservingness,

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.348
and their ideology
of self-interest increase.

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:44.877
In surveys, we've found

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.764
that it's actually wealthier individuals
who are more likely to moralize

00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:50.495
greed being good,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:54.487
and that the pursuit of self-interest
is favorable and moral.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.693
Now, what I want to do today
is talk about some of the implications

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:00.612
of this ideology self-interest,

00:06:01.668 --> 00:06:04.312
talk about why we should
care about those implications,

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:05.935
and end with what might be done.

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:09.982
Some of the first studies
that we ran in this area

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:11.342
looked at helping behavior,

00:06:11.366 --> 00:06:14.573
something social psychologists
call "pro-social behavior."

00:06:15.453 --> 00:06:16.902
And we were really interested

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:20.327
in who's more likely
to offer help to another person:

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:22.674
someone who's rich or someone who's poor.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:24.823
In one of the studies,

00:06:24.847 --> 00:06:30.277
we bring rich and poor members
of the community into the lab,

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.213
and give each of them
the equivalent of 10 dollars.

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:37.997
We told the participants they could keep
these 10 dollars for themselves,

00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:40.909
or they could share
a portion of it, if they wanted to,

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.277
with a stranger, who's totally anonymous.

00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:46.558
They'll never meet that stranger;
the stranger will never meet them.

00:06:46.582 --> 00:06:48.832
And we just monitor how much people give.

00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:54.203
Individuals who made 25,000,
sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,

00:06:54.227 --> 00:06:57.544
gave 44 percent more
of their money to the stranger

00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:01.273
than did individuals making
150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:05.020
We've had people play games

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.475
to see who's more or less likely to cheat

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.853
to increase their chances
of winning a prize.

00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:13.626
In one of the games,
we actually rigged a computer

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.330
so that die rolls over a certain score
were impossible --

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:21.446
You couldn't get above 12
in this game, and yet ...

00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:25.753
the richer you were, the more likely
you were to cheat in this game

00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:28.502
to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:31.384
sometimes by three to four times as much.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:34.270
We ran another study

00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:38.085
where we looked at whether people
would be inclined to take candy

00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:41.114
from a jar of candy
that we explicitly identified

00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:43.018
as being reserved for children --

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:46.638
(Laughter)

00:07:46.662 --> 00:07:50.816
I'm not kidding -- I know it sounds
like I'm making a joke.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.451
We explicitly told participants:

00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:57.808
"This candy is for children participating
in a developmental lab nearby.

00:07:57.832 --> 00:07:59.961
They're in studies. This is for them."

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:02.909
And we just monitored
how much candy participants took.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:06.482
Participants who felt rich
took two times as much candy

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:08.159
as participants who felt poor.

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:11.632
We've even studied cars.

00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:13.984
Not just any cars,

00:08:14.008 --> 00:08:17.272
but whether drivers
of different kinds of cars

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:20.314
are more or less inclined
to break the law.

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:21.850
In one of these studies,

00:08:22.558 --> 00:08:27.285
we looked at whether drivers
would stop for a pedestrian

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:30.169
that we had posed waiting
to cross at a crosswalk.

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:32.041
Now in California, as you all know,

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:34.469
because I'm sure we all do this,

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:38.014
it's the law to stop for a pedestrian
who's waiting to cross.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.276
So here's an example of how we did it.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.843
That's our confederate off to the left,
posing as a pedestrian.

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:47.849
He approaches as the red truck
successfully stops.

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:49.998
In typical California fashion,

00:08:50.022 --> 00:08:52.991
it's overtaken by the bus
who almost runs our pedestrian over.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:54.368
(Laughter)

00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:56.597
Now here's an example
of a more expensive car,

00:08:56.621 --> 00:09:00.868
a Prius, driving through,
and a BMW doing the same.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.005
So we did this for hundreds of vehicles

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:08.488
on several days,

00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:10.936
just tracking who stops and who doesn't.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:16.840
What we found was as the expensiveness
of a car increased ...

00:09:16.864 --> 00:09:18.936
(Laughter)

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.191
the drivers' tendencies
to break the law increased as well.

00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:25.016
None of the cars -- none of the cars --

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.111
in our least expensive car category

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:29.293
broke the law.

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:34.636
Close to 50 percent of the cars
in our most expensive vehicle category

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.859
broke the law.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.798
We've run other studies,

00:09:38.822 --> 00:09:42.709
finding that wealthier individuals
are more likely to lie in negotiations,

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:44.924
to endorse unethical behavior at work,

00:09:44.948 --> 00:09:47.548
like stealing cash from the cash register,

00:09:47.662 --> 00:09:50.451
taking bribes, lying to customers.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:54.290
Now, I don't mean to suggest

00:09:54.314 --> 00:09:57.888
that it's only wealthy people
who show these patterns of behavior.

00:09:57.912 --> 00:10:00.718
Not at all -- in fact,
I think that we all,

00:10:00.742 --> 00:10:03.661
in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,

00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:06.534
struggle with these competing motivations

00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:12.249
of when or if to put our own interests
above the interests of other people.

00:10:12.273 --> 00:10:14.549
And that's understandable,

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:17.470
because the American dream is an idea

00:10:17.494 --> 00:10:22.329
in which we all have an equal opportunity
to succeed and prosper,

00:10:22.353 --> 00:10:24.909
as long as we apply
ourselves and work hard.

00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:27.642
And a piece of that means that sometimes,

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:30.595
you need to put your own interests

00:10:30.619 --> 00:10:34.128
above the interests and well-being
of other people around you.

00:10:34.152 --> 00:10:37.523
But what we're finding
is that the wealthier you are,

00:10:37.547 --> 00:10:41.387
the more likely you are to pursue
a vision of personal success,

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:43.736
of achievement and accomplishment,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.948
to the detriment of others around you.

00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:50.200
Here I've plotted for you
the mean household income

00:10:50.224 --> 00:10:53.460
received by each fifth
and top five percent of the population

00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:54.912
over the last 20 years.

00:10:55.579 --> 00:10:56.813
In 1993,

00:10:56.837 --> 00:10:59.963
the differences between the different
quintiles of the population,

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:01.175
in terms of income,

00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:03.271
are fairly egregious.

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:06.422
It's not difficult to discern
that there are differences.

00:11:06.446 --> 00:11:09.275
But over the last 20 years,
that significant difference

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.591
has become a Grand Canyon of sorts

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:14.639
between those at the top
and everyone else.

00:11:14.663 --> 00:11:18.297
In fact, the top 20 percent
of our population

00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:21.420
own close to 90 percent
of the total wealth in this country.

00:11:21.444 --> 00:11:25.123
We're at unprecedented levels
of economic inequality.

00:11:27.858 --> 00:11:31.699
What that means is that wealth is not only
becoming increasingly concentrated

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:34.657
in the hands of a select group
of individuals,

00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:39.009
but the American dream
is becoming increasingly unattainable

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:41.375
for an increasing majority of us.

00:11:42.227 --> 00:11:45.026
And if it's the case,
as we've been finding,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.499
that the wealthier you are,

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:49.042
the more entitled you feel to that wealth,

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:52.064
and the more likely you are
to prioritize your own interests

00:11:52.088 --> 00:11:53.844
above the interests of other people,

00:11:53.868 --> 00:11:57.393
and be willing to do things
to serve that self-interest,

00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:01.084
well, then, there's no reason to think
that those patterns will change.

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:04.640
In fact, there's every reason
to think that they'll only get worse,

00:12:04.664 --> 00:12:07.850
and that's what it would look like
if things just stayed the same,

00:12:07.874 --> 00:12:10.932
at the same linear rate,
over the next 20 years.

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:14.902
Now inequality -- economic inequality --

00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:17.125
is something we should
all be concerned about,

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:20.752
and not just because of those
at the bottom of the social hierarchy,

00:12:20.776 --> 00:12:23.120
but because individuals and groups

00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:27.617
with lots of economic
inequality do worse ...

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:30.643
not just the people
at the bottom, everyone.

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:33.273
There's a lot of really
compelling research

00:12:33.297 --> 00:12:35.957
coming out from top labs
all over the world,

00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:40.631
showcasing the range of things
that are undermined

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:43.171
as economic inequality gets worse.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.024
Social mobility,
things we really care about,

00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:48.506
physical health, social trust,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.462
all go down as inequality goes up.

00:12:51.486 --> 00:12:56.011
Similarly, negative things
in social collectives and societies,

00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:58.115
things like obesity, and violence,

00:12:58.139 --> 00:12:59.737
imprisonment, and punishment,

00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:03.887
are exacerbated as economic
inequality increases.

00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:07.454
Again, these are outcomes
not just experienced by a few,

00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:10.916
but that resound
across all strata of society.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.600
Even people at the top
experience these outcomes.

00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:16.156
So what do we do?

00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:20.889
This cascade of self-perpetuating,

00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:23.398
pernicious, negative effects

00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:26.818
could seem like something
that's spun out of control,

00:13:26.842 --> 00:13:28.730
and there's nothing we can do about it,

00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:31.009
certainly nothing
we as individuals could do.

00:13:31.558 --> 00:13:37.647
But in fact, we've been finding
in our own laboratory research

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.100
that small psychological interventions,

00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:46.714
small changes to people's values,

00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:50.188
small nudges in certain directions,

00:13:50.212 --> 00:13:53.346
can restore levels
of egalitarianism and empathy.

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:58.032
For instance, reminding people
of the benefits of cooperation

00:13:58.056 --> 00:13:59.951
or the advantages of community,

00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:04.773
cause wealthier individuals
to be just as egalitarian

00:14:04.797 --> 00:14:06.122
as poor people.

00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:12.894
In one study, we had people watch
a brief video, just 46 seconds long,

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.336
about childhood poverty

00:14:15.144 --> 00:14:19.345
that served as a reminder of the needs
of others in the world around them.

00:14:20.257 --> 00:14:22.152
And after watching that,

00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:25.632
we looked at how willing people
were to offer up their own time

00:14:26.242 --> 00:14:30.273
to a stranger presented to them
in the lab, who was in distress.

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:34.246
After watching this video, an hour later,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.650
rich people became
just as generous of their own time

00:14:37.674 --> 00:14:39.820
to help out this other person, a stranger,

00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.289
as someone who's poor,

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:45.571
suggesting that these differences
are not innate or categorical,

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:49.351
but are so malleable
to slight changes in people's values,

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.783
and little nudges of compassion
and bumps of empathy.

00:14:53.172 --> 00:14:54.749
And beyond the walls of our lab,

00:14:54.773 --> 00:14:58.052
we're even beginning to see
signs of change in society.

00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:02.041
Bill Gates, one of our nation's
wealthiest individuals,

00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:03.993
in his Harvard commencement speech,

00:15:04.017 --> 00:15:06.878
talked about the problem
of inequality facing society

00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:09.565
as being the most daunting challenge,

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:12.423
and talked about what must
be done to combat it,

00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:17.465
saying, "Humanity's greatest advances
are not in its discoveries --

00:15:17.489 --> 00:15:20.521
but in how those discoveries are applied

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.333
to reduce inequity."

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:25.285
And there's the Giving Pledge,

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:29.236
in which more than 100
of our nation's wealthiest individuals

00:15:30.077 --> 00:15:33.259
are pledging half
of their fortunes to charity.

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:38.358
And there's the emergence of dozens
of grassroots movements,

00:15:39.136 --> 00:15:40.889
like "We are the 1 percent,"

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:42.991
"Resource Generation,"

00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:45.445
or "Wealth for Common Good,"

00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:49.808
in which the most privileged
members of the population,

00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:52.776
members of the one percent and elsewhere,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.539
people who are wealthy,

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:58.115
are using their own economic resources,

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:02.372
adults and youth alike --
that's what's most striking to me --

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:05.957
leveraging their own privilege,
their own economic resources,

00:16:05.981 --> 00:16:08.822
to combat inequality

00:16:08.846 --> 00:16:11.288
by advocating for social policies,

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:13.724
changes in social values

00:16:13.748 --> 00:16:16.006
and changes in people's behavior

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:19.183
that work against
their own economic interests,

00:16:19.207 --> 00:16:22.385
but that may ultimately
restore the American dream.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.640
Thank you.

00:16:24.664 --> 00:16:29.999
(Applause)
