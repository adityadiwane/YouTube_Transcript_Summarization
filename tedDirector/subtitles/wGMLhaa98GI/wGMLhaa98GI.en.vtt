00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.812
Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:18.918
through a window at a dolphin
spinning playfully,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.076
but what you're actually looking through

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.637
is a two-way mirror at a dolphin

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.827
looking at itself spinning playfully.

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.950
This is a dolphin that is self-aware.

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.572
This dolphin has self-awareness.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.652
It's a young dolphin named Bayley.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:35.700
I've been very interested
in understanding the nature

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:39.123
of the intelligence of dolphins
for the past 30 years.

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:42.307
How do we explore
intelligence in this animal

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.797
that's so different from us?

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.857
And what I've used is a very
simple research tool,

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.437
a mirror, and we've gained
great information,

00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:52.894
reflections of these animal minds.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.494
Dolphins aren't the only animals,
the only non-human animals,

00:00:56.518 --> 00:00:58.634
to show mirror self-recognition.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.626
We used to think this
was a uniquely human ability,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.927
but we learned that the great
apes, our closest relatives,

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.512
also show this ability.

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:08.211
Then we showed it in dolphins,

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.223
and then later in elephants.

00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:13.057
We did this work in my lab
with the dolphins and elephants,

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.226
and it's been recently
shown in the magpie.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.126
Now, it's interesting,
because we've embraced

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.148
this Darwinian view of a continuity
in physical evolution,

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:23.740
this physical continuity.

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:27.023
But we've been much more
reticent, much slower

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:30.959
at recognizing this
continuity in cognition,

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:33.943
in emotion, in consciousness
in other animals.

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:36.509
Other animals are conscious.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.799
They're emotional. They're aware.

00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:42.684
There have been multitudes
of studies with many species

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:46.255
over the years that have
given us exquisite evidence

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.126
for thinking and consciousness
in other animals,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.717
other animals that are quite
different than we are in form.

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:55.410
We are not alone.

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:59.540
We are not alone in these abilities.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:02.905
And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.676
is that, with our growing awareness

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.272
about the consciousness of others

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:09.916
and our relationship with the rest
of the animal world,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.506
that we'll give them
the respect and protection

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.387
that they deserve.

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.935
So that's a wish I'm throwing
out here for everybody,

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.776
and I hope I can really
engage you in this idea.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.419
Now, I want to return to dolphins,

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:23.635
because these are the animals
that I feel like

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.180
I've been working up closely
and personal with

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:27.590
for over 30 years.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.439
And these are real personalities.

00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:32.540
They are not persons,
but they're personalities

00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.026
in every sense of the word.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.212
And you can't get more
alien than the dolphin.

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.708
They are very different
from us in body form.

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:43.447
They're radically different. They come
from a radically different environment.

00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:47.057
In fact, we're separated
by 95 million years

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.203
of divergent evolution.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.103
Look at this body.

00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:54.793
And in every sense of making a pun here,

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:59.156
these are true non-terrestrials.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.604
I wondered how we might
interface with these animals.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:05.926
In the 1980s, I developed
an underwater keyboard.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.345
This was a custom-made
touch-screen keyboard.

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.274
What I wanted to do was give
the dolphins choice and control.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:13.396
These are big brains,
highly social animals,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.562
and I thought, well, if we give
them choice and control,

00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:18.634
if they can hit a symbol
on this keyboard --

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:21.305
and by the way, it was interfaced
by fiber optic cables

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.175
from Hewlett-Packard
with an Apple II computer.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.062
This seems prehistoric now,

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.259
but this was where
we were with technology.

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.082
So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.256
they heard a computer-generated whistle,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.061
and they got an object or activity.

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:36.479
Now here's a little video.

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:39.297
This is Delphi and Pan,
and you're going to see Delphi

00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:43.446
hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated
whistle -- (Whistle) --

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.159
and gets a ball, so they can
actually ask for things they want.

00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:51.298
What was remarkable is,
they explored this keyboard

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:54.645
on their own. There was no
intervention on our part.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.289
They explored the keyboard.
They played around with it.

00:03:57.313 --> 00:03:58.848
They figured out how it worked.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.063
And they started to quickly
imitate the sounds

00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:03.812
they were hearing on the keyboard.

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:05.769
They imitated on their own.

00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:07.940
Beyond that, though, they started learning

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:10.700
associations
between the symbols, the sounds

00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:13.025
and the objects.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.552
What we saw was self-organized learning,

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:19.951
and now I'm imagining, what can we do

00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:21.353
with new technologies?

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:24.288
How can we create interfaces,
new windows into

00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:29.209
the minds of animals,
with the technologies that exist today?

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:32.296
So I was thinking about this,
and then, one day,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.280
I got a call from Peter.

00:04:38.753 --> 00:04:40.753
Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:42.491
On a good day, it's music,

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.277
and I want to talk a little bit about

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:48.416
the most amazing music-making
experience I ever had.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.632
I'm a farm boy. I grew
up surrounded by animals,

00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:53.631
and I would look in these eyes and wonder

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:55.326
what was going on there?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.594
So as an adult, when
I started to read about

00:04:57.618 --> 00:05:00.863
the amazing breakthroughs
with Penny Patterson and Koko,

00:05:00.887 --> 00:05:04.097
with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
and Kanzi, Panbanisha,

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.518
Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.986
I got all excited.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.957
What was amazing to me also

00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:14.786
was they seemed a lot more adept

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.750
at getting a handle on our language

00:05:17.774 --> 00:05:21.914
than we were on getting
a handle on theirs.

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.533
I work with a lot of musicians
from around the world,

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:28.301
and often we don't have
any common language at all,

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:31.988
but we sit down behind our instruments,

00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:35.325
and suddenly there's a way
for us to connect and emote.

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.141
So I started cold-calling,
and eventually got through

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:40.274
to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.173
and she invited me down.

00:05:42.197 --> 00:05:46.555
I went down, and the bonobos

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.326
had had access to percussion instruments,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.960
musical toys, but never
before to a keyboard.

00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:54.604
At first they did what infants do,

00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:56.635
just bashed it with their fists,

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.108
and then I asked, through Sue,

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:03.081
if Panbanisha could try
with one finger only.

00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:08.258
Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Can
you play a grooming song?

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:10.184
I want to hear a grooming song.

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:14.640
Play a real quiet grooming song.

00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:20.376
PG: So groom was the subject of the piece.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.212
(Music)

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:41.641
So I'm just behind, jamming,

00:06:41.665 --> 00:06:46.386
yeah, this is what we started with.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.903
Sue's encouraging her
to continue a little more.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:54.828
(Music)

00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:43.628
She discovers a note she likes,

00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:47.343
finds the octave.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:52.271
She'd never sat at a keyboard before.

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:02.498
Nice triplets.

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:16.019
SSR: You did good. That was very good.

00:08:16.043 --> 00:08:17.434
PG: She hit good.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:22.925
(Applause)

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:27.170
So that night, we began to dream,

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:29.945
and we thought, perhaps
the most amazing tool

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:32.125
that man's created is the Internet,

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:35.933
and what would happen if we could somehow

00:08:35.957 --> 00:08:37.829
find new interfaces,

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:41.432
visual-audio interfaces that would allow

00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:43.792
these remarkable sentient beings

00:08:43.816 --> 00:08:46.378
that we share the planet with access?

00:08:46.402 --> 00:08:50.390
And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
got excited about that,

00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:52.511
called her friend Steve Woodruff,

00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:55.599
and we began hustling all sorts of people

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:58.662
whose work related or was inspiring,

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.831
which led us to Diana,

00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:03.818
and led us to Neil.

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:06.033
Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter.
PG: Thank you.

00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:09.642
(Applause)

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.314
NG: So Peter approached me.

00:09:11.338 --> 00:09:13.934
I lost it when I saw that clip.

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.994
He approached me with a vision
of doing these things

00:09:17.018 --> 00:09:18.608
not for people, for animals.

00:09:18.632 --> 00:09:21.386
And then I was struck
in the history of the Internet.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.289
This is what the Internet
looked like when it was born

00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:27.822
and you can call that the Internet

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:29.450
of middle-aged white men,

00:09:29.474 --> 00:09:30.470
mostly middle-aged white men.

00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:32.547
Vint Cerf: (Laughs)

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.585
(Laughter)

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.207
NG: Speaking as one.

00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:40.315
Then, when I first came to TED,

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:42.441
which was where I met
Peter, I showed this.

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.827
This is a $1 web server,

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.276
and at the time that was radical.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.982
And the possibility of making
a web server for a dollar

00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:54.527
grew into what became known
as the Internet of Things,

00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:57.779
which is literally an industry
now with tremendous implications

00:09:57.803 --> 00:10:00.256
for health care, energy efficiency.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.673
And we were happy with ourselves.

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:03.364
And then when Peter showed me that,

00:10:03.388 --> 00:10:05.055
I realized we had missed something,

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:07.082
which is the rest of the planet.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.583
So we started up this
interspecies Internet project.

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:11.209
Now we started talking with TED

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.948
about how you bring dolphins
and great apes and elephants

00:10:13.972 --> 00:10:16.523
to TED, and we realized
that wouldn't work.

00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:18.597
So we're going to bring you to them.

00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:21.193
So if we could switch
to the audio from this computer,

00:10:21.217 --> 00:10:24.538
we've been video conferencing
with cognitive animals,

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:25.750
and we're going to have each of them

00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:27.485
just briefly introduce them.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:29.605
And so if we could also
have this up, great.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.432
So the first site we're going to meet

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:34.500
is Cameron Park Zoo
in Waco, with orangutans.

00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:37.334
In the daytime they live outside.
It's nighttime there now.

00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:40.399
So can you please go ahead?

00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:43.058
Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:45.488
with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:49.179
and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,

00:10:49.203 --> 00:10:51.251
two of our Bornean orangutans.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:56.379
During the day, they have
a beautiful, large outdoor habitat,

00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:59.071
and at night, they come into this habitat,

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:00.787
into their night quarters,

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:02.716
where they can have a climate-controlled

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.708
and secure environment to sleep in.

00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:09.103
We participate in the Apps
for Apes program

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:12.536
Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.725
to help stimulate and enrich the animals,

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:16.434
and also help raise awareness

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:18.871
for these critically endangered animals.

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:23.119
And they share 97 percent of our DNA

00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:24.927
and are incredibly intelligent,

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.438
so it's so exciting to think
of all the opportunities

00:11:28.462 --> 00:11:31.474
that we have via technology
and the Internet

00:11:31.498 --> 00:11:35.216
to really enrich their lives
and open up their world.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.293
We're really excited about the possibility

00:11:37.317 --> 00:11:39.143
of an interspecies Internet,

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:43.496
and K.J. has
been enjoying the conference very much.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.044
NG: That's great. When we were
rehearsing last night,

00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:47.940
he had fun watching the elephants.

00:11:47.964 --> 00:11:51.008
Next user group are the dolphins
at the National Aquarium.

00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:53.502
Please go ahead.

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:54.651
Allison Ginsburg: Good evening.

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:56.295
Well, my name is Allison Ginsburg,

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:59.141
and we're live in Baltimore
at the National Aquarium.

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:02.786
Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins:

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.945
20-year-old Chesapeake,
who was our first dolphin born here,

00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:08.657
her four-year-old daughter Bayley,

00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.076
and her half sister, 11-year-old Maya.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.720
Now, here at the National Aquarium

00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:16.697
we are committed to excellence
in animal care,

00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.169
to research, and to conservation.

00:12:19.193 --> 00:12:22.481
The dolphins are pretty intrigued
as to what's going on here tonight.

00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:24.696
They're not really used
to having cameras here

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.173
at 8 o'clock at night.

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:28.907
In addition, we are very
committed to doing

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:30.365
different types of research.

00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:32.978
As Diana mentioned,
our animals are involved

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:36.113
in many different research studies.

00:12:46.927 --> 00:12:50.292
NG: Those are for you.

00:12:50.316 --> 00:12:52.090
Okay, that's great, thank you.

00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:55.332
And the third user group, in Thailand,

00:12:55.356 --> 00:12:59.685
is Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.960
Josh Plotnik: Hi, my name is Josh Plotnik,

00:13:01.984 --> 00:13:04.176
and I'm with Think
Elephants International,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.534
and we're here in the Golden
Triangle of Thailand

00:13:06.558 --> 00:13:09.609
with the Golden Triangle Asian
Elephant Foundation elephants.

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.989
And we have 26 elephants here,

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:16.182
and our research is focused on the evolution
of intelligence with elephants,

00:13:16.206 --> 00:13:18.545
but our foundation Think
Elephants is focused

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:21.591
on bringing elephants
into classrooms around the world

00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:23.795
virtually like this and showing people

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:25.928
how incredible these animals are.

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:28.087
So we're able to bring the camera
right up to the elephant,

00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:30.305
put food into the elephant's mouth,

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:32.751
show people what's going
on inside their mouths,

00:13:32.775 --> 00:13:34.887
and show everyone around the world

00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:37.791
how incredible these animals really are.

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:40.295
NG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.287
And once again, we've been building
great relationships

00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:44.743
among them just
since we've been rehearsing.

00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:47.529
So at that point, if we can go
back to the other computer,

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:49.887
we were starting to think
about how you integrate

00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:52.736
the rest of the biomass
of the planet into the Internet,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.343
and we went to the best possible person

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:58.006
I can think of, which is Vint Cerf,

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.052
who is one of the founders
who gave us the Internet. Vint?

00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:03.420
VC: Thank you, Neil.

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:07.006
(Applause)

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:12.086
A long time ago in a galaxy
— oops, wrong script.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.556
Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.155
did the design of the Internet.

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:18.918
Thirty years ago, we turned it on.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:22.003
Just last year, we turned
on the production Internet.

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:24.126
You've been using the experimental version

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.602
for the last 30 years.

00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:28.956
The production version,
it uses IP version 6.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.956
It has 3.4 times 10 to the 38th
possible terminations.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.113
That's a number only that Congress
can appreciate.

00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:41.214
But it leads to what is coming next.

00:14:41.238 --> 00:14:43.876
When Bob and I did this design,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.382
we thought we were building a system
to connect computers together.

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.217
What we very quickly discovered

00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:52.400
is that this was a system
for connecting people together.

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.868
And what you've seen tonight

00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:58.810
tells you that we should
not restrict this network

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:00.992
to one species,

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:04.833
that these other intelligent,
sentient species

00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:07.306
should be part of the system too.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.664
This is the system as it
looks today, by the way.

00:15:09.688 --> 00:15:12.859
This is what the Internet
looks like to a computer

00:15:12.883 --> 00:15:15.129
that's trying to figure
out where the traffic

00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:16.778
is supposed to go.

00:15:16.802 --> 00:15:19.403
This is generated by a program

00:15:19.427 --> 00:15:22.152
that's looking at the connectivity
of the Internet,

00:15:22.176 --> 00:15:24.989
and how all the various networks
are connected together.

00:15:25.013 --> 00:15:28.354
There are about 400,000
networks, interconnected,

00:15:28.378 --> 00:15:33.493
run independently by 400,000
different operating agencies,

00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:34.946
and the only reason this works

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.771
is that they all use the same
standard TCP/IP protocols.

00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:41.126
Well, you know where this is headed.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.417
The Internet of Things tell us

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:47.713
that a lot of computer-enabled
appliances and devices

00:15:47.737 --> 00:15:50.169
are going to become part
of this system too:

00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:52.442
appliances that you use around the house,

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:54.361
that you use in your office,

00:15:54.385 --> 00:15:56.986
that you carry around with yourself
or in the car.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.353
That's the Internet
of Things that's coming.

00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:02.155
Now, what's important
about what these people are doing

00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:04.506
is that they're beginning to learn

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.756
how to communicate with species

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.098
that are not us

00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:12.201
but share a common sensory environment.

00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.425
We're beginning to explore what it means

00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:15.989
to communicate with something

00:16:16.013 --> 00:16:18.351
that isn't just another person.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.077
Well, you can see what's coming next.

00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:24.005
All kinds of possible sentient beings

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:26.029
may be interconnected through this system,

00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:29.146
and I can't wait to see
these experiments unfold.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.161
What happens after that?

00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:33.891
Well, let's see.

00:16:33.915 --> 00:16:37.076
There are machines that need
to talk to machines

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.334
and that we need to talk to,
and so as time goes on,

00:16:40.358 --> 00:16:42.153
we're going to have to learn

00:16:42.177 --> 00:16:43.921
how to communicate with computers

00:16:43.945 --> 00:16:46.420
and how to get computers
to communicate with us

00:16:46.444 --> 00:16:48.239
in the way that we're accustomed to,

00:16:48.263 --> 00:16:51.102
not with keyboards, not with mice,

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:53.166
but with speech and gestures

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.150
and all the natural human language
that we're accustomed to.

00:16:56.174 --> 00:16:58.287
So we'll need something like C3PO

00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:01.735
to become a translator between ourselves

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.877
and some of the other
machines we live with.

00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:06.253
Now, there is a project that's underway

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:08.075
called the interplanetary Internet.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.799
It's in operation between Earth and Mars.

00:17:10.823 --> 00:17:13.821
It's operating on the International
Space Station.

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:17.512
It's part of the spacecraft
that's in orbit around the Sun

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.334
that's rendezvoused with two planets.

00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:21.598
So the interplanetary
system is on its way,

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.306
but there's a last project,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.102
which the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency,

00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:28.061
which funded the original ARPANET,

00:17:28.086 --> 00:17:31.551
funded the Internet, funded
the interplanetary architecture,

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:34.887
is now funding a project
to design a spacecraft

00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:39.049
to get to the nearest
star in 100 years' time.

00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:41.652
What that means
is that what we're learning

00:17:41.676 --> 00:17:43.824
with these interactions with other species

00:17:43.848 --> 00:17:45.963
will teach us, ultimately,

00:17:45.987 --> 00:17:49.956
how we might interact
with an alien from another world.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.606
I can hardly wait.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:59.807
(Applause)

00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:00.785
June Cohen: So first of all, thank you,

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.343
and I would like to acknowledge
that four people

00:18:03.367 --> 00:18:05.256
who could talk to us for full four days

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.471
actually managed to stay
to four minutes each,

00:18:07.495 --> 00:18:08.854
and we thank you for that.

00:18:08.878 --> 00:18:10.133
I have so many questions,

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:13.491
but maybe a few practical things
that the audience might want to know.

00:18:13.515 --> 00:18:16.017
You're launching this idea here at TED —
PG: Today.

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.213
JC: Today. This is the first
time you're talking about it.

00:18:17.237 --> 00:18:20.237
Tell me a little bit about where
you're going to take the idea.

00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:21.270
What's next?

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:24.558
PG: I think we want
to engage as many people

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:26.618
here as possible in helping us

00:18:26.642 --> 00:18:30.967
think of smart interfaces
that will make all this possible.

00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:32.333
NG: And just mechanically,

00:18:32.357 --> 00:18:34.838
there's a 501(c)(3) and web infrastructure

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:36.861
and all of that, but it's not
quite ready to turn on,

00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:38.893
so we'll roll that out, and contact us

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.537
if you want the information on it.

00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:43.644
The idea is this will be -- much
like the Internet functions

00:18:43.668 --> 00:18:44.649
as a network of networks,

00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:46.293
which is Vint's core contribution,

00:18:46.317 --> 00:18:48.558
this will be a wrapper
around all of these initiatives,

00:18:48.582 --> 00:18:51.353
that are wonderful individually,
to link them globally.

00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:52.917
JC: Right, and do you have a web address

00:18:52.941 --> 00:18:53.961
that we might look for yet?

00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.747
NG: Shortly. JC: Shortly. We
will come back to you on that.

00:18:56.771 --> 00:19:00.024
And very quickly, just to clarify.

00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:02.231
Some people might have looked
at the video that you showed

00:19:02.255 --> 00:19:03.739
and thought, well, that's just a webcam.

00:19:03.763 --> 00:19:04.810
What's special about it?

00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:06.501
If you could talk for just a moment

00:19:06.525 --> 00:19:08.242
about how you want to go past that?

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:11.759
NG: So this is scalable
video infrastructure,

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:14.172
not for a few to a few but many to many,

00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:17.182
so that it scales
to symmetrical video sharing

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:20.320
and content sharing across these
sites around the planet.

00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:23.008
So there's a lot of back-end
signal processing,

00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:25.626
not for one to many, but for many to many.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.178
JC: Right, and then on a practical level,

00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:28.889
which technologies are you
looking at first?

00:19:28.913 --> 00:19:32.239
I know you mentioned that a keyboard
is a really key part of this.

00:19:32.263 --> 00:19:35.275
DR: We're trying to develop
an interactive touch screen for dolphins.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:38.109
This is sort of a continuation
of some of the earlier work,

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:40.989
and we just got our first seed
money today towards that,

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.362
so it's our first project.

00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:44.101
JC: Before the talk, even. DR: Yeah.

00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:45.452
JC: Wow. Well done.

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.953
All right, well thank you
all so much for joining us.

00:19:47.977 --> 00:19:50.088
It's such a delight
to have you on the stage.

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:51.493
DR: Thank you. VC: Thank you.

00:19:51.517 --> 00:19:56.654
