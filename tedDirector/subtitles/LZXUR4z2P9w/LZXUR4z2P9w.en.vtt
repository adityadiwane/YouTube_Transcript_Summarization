00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.464
Have you heard the news?

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:17.438
We're in a clean energy revolution.

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:19.452
And where I live in Berkeley, California,

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:23.760
it seems like every day I see a new roof
with new solar panels going up,

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:25.511
electric car in the driveway.

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:29.027
Germany sometimes gets
half its power from solar,

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:33.544
and India is now committed
to building 10 times more solar

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:34.896
than we have in California,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.442
by the year 2022.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:39.246
Even nuclear seems to be
making a comeback.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:42.919
Bill Gates is in China
working with engineers,

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.740
there's 40 different companies
that are working together

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:49.089
to try to race to build the first
reactor that runs on waste,

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:50.350
that can't melt down

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:51.692
and is cheaper than coal.

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:54.797
And so you might start to ask:

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.227
Is this whole global warming problem

00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:00.201
going to be a lot easier to solve
than anybody imagined?

00:01:00.504 --> 00:01:02.455
That was the question we wanted to know,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.721
so my colleagues and I decided
to take a deep dive into the data.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.772
We were a little skeptical of some parts

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.803
of the clean energy revolution story,

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:12.587
but what we found really surprised us.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:16.521
The first thing is that clean
energy has been increasing.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:20.666
This is electricity from clean energy
sources over the last 20 years.

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:24.741
But when you look at
the percentage of global electricity

00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:26.104
from clean energy sources,

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:30.694
it's actually been in decline
from 36 percent to 31 percent.

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:32.900
And if you care about climate change,

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.070
you've got to go in the opposite direction

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:38.644
to 100 percent of our electricity
from clean energy sources,

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:40.266
as quickly as possible.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.447
Now, you might wonder,

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:45.340
"Come on, how much could five percentage
points of global electricity be?"

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:47.131
Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:50.298
It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:53.933
the size of Diablo Canyon,
California's last nuclear plant,

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.626
or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.179
which is one of the biggest
solar farms in the world,

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.829
and certainly our biggest in California.

00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:06.831
A big part of this is simply
that fossil fuels are increasing

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:08.108
faster than clean energy.

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:09.371
And that's understandable.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.110
There's just a lot of poor countries

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:13.587
that are still using wood
and dung and charcoal

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.196
as their main source of energy,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.671
and they need modern fuels.

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:18.644
But there's something else going on,

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:22.723
which is that one of those clean energy
sources in particular

00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:26.155
has actually been on the decline
in absolute terms,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.680
not just relatively.

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:28.918
And that's nuclear.

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:32.591
You can see its generation
has declined seven percent

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:34.452
over the last 10 years.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.084
Now, solar and wind have been
making huge strides,

00:02:37.108 --> 00:02:40.016
so you hear a lot of talk
about how it doesn't really matter,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.778
because solar and wind
is going to make up the difference.

00:02:42.802 --> 00:02:44.658
But the data says something different.

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.727
When you combine all the electricity
from solar and wind,

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:52.550
you see it actually barely makes up
half of the decline from nuclear.

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:56.076
Let's take a closer look
in the United States.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.891
Over the last couple of years --
really 2013, 2014 --

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:03.384
we prematurely retired
four nuclear power plants.

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:06.207
They were almost entirely
replaced with fossil fuels,

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:09.737
and so the consequence
was that we wiped out

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.687
almost as much clean energy
electricity that we get from solar.

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.732
And it's not unique to us.

00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:21.184
People think of California
as a clean energy and climate leader,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.216
but when we looked at the data,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.741
what we found is that, in fact,

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:27.968
California reduced emissions more slowly
than the national average,

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:29.835
between 2000 and 2015.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.594
What about Germany?

00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:33.651
They're doing a lot of clean energy.

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:35.406
But when you look at the data,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.708
German emissions have actually
been going up since 2009,

00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:41.307
and there's really not anybody
who's going to tell you

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:44.639
that they're going to meet
their climate commitments in 2020.

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:46.889
The reason isn't hard to understand.

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:50.216
Solar and wind provide power
about 10 to 20 percent of the time,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.288
which means that when
the sun's not shining,

00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:53.664
the wind's not blowing,

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.839
you still need power for your hospitals,

00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:58.593
your homes, your cities, your factories.

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:02.521
And while batteries have made
some really cool improvements lately,

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:05.253
the truth is, they're just never
going to be as efficient

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:06.476
as the electrical grid.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.627
Every time you put electricity
into a battery and take it out,

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.907
you lose about 20 to 40
percent of the power.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.063
That's why when, in California,

00:04:16.087 --> 00:04:18.801
we try to deal with all the solar
we've brought online --

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.589
we now get about 10 percent
of electricity from solar --

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:24.255
when the sun goes down,
and people come home from work

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.769
and turn on their air conditioners
and their TV sets,

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:28.691
and every other appliance in the house,

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.176
we need a lot of natural gas backup.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.365
So what we've been doing

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.303
is stuffing a lot of natural gas
into the side of a mountain.

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:37.865
And that worked pretty well for a while,

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.880
but then late last year,
it sprung a leak.

00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:42.744
This is Aliso Canyon.

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:45.782
So much methane gas was released,

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:48.992
it was the equivalent of putting
half a million cars on the road.

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:52.913
It basically blew through all
of our climate commitments for the year.

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.005
Well, what about India?

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.280
Sometimes you have to go places
to really get the right data,

00:04:58.304 --> 00:05:00.285
so we traveled to India a few months ago.

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.440
We met with all the top officials --
solar, nuclear, the rest --

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:05.005
and what they told us is,

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.083
"We're actually having
more serious problems

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:08.782
than both Germany and California.

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:12.339
We don't have backup;
we don't have all the natural gas.

00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:14.895
And that's just the start of it.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.808
Say we want to get
to 100 gigawatts by 2022.

00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:19.784
But last year we did just five,

00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:21.846
and the year before that, we did five."

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.746
So, let's just take
a closer look at nuclear.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.993
The United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change

00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:30.988
has looked at the carbon content
of all these different fuels,

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:34.945
and nuclear comes out really low --
it's actually lower even than solar.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.864
And nuclear obviously
provides a lot of power --

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:41.441
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:45.399
During a year, a single plant can provide
power 92 percent of the time.

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:47.995
What's interesting is that
when you look at countries

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.561
that have deployed different
kinds of clean energies,

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.485
there's only a few that have done so

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.364
at a pace consistent with dealing
with the climate crisis.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.439
So nuclear seems like
a pretty good option,

00:05:57.463 --> 00:05:59.501
but there's this big problem with it,

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.555
which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.407
which is that people really don't like it.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.622
There was a study, a survey done
of people around the world,

00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:10.149
not just in the United States or Europe,

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:11.704
about a year and a half ago.

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:13.062
And what they found

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:16.878
is that nuclear is actually one
of the least popular forms of energy.

00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:19.332
Even oil is more popular than nuclear.

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:22.522
And while nuclear kind of
edges out coal, the thing is,

00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:26.363
people don't really fear coal
in the same way they fear nuclear,

00:06:26.387 --> 00:06:28.804
which really operates on our unconscious.

00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:30.463
So what is it that we fear?

00:06:30.487 --> 00:06:32.037
There's really three things.

00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.301
There's the safety
of the plants themselves --

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:37.130
the fears that they're going
to melt down and cause damage;

00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:38.499
there's the waste from them;

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.030
and there's the association with weapons.

00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:42.998
And I think, understandably,

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:47.064
engineers look at those concerns
and look for technological fixes.

00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:50.071
That's why Bill Gates is in China
developing advanced reactors.

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:53.219
That's why 40 different entrepreneurs
are working on this problem.

00:06:53.243 --> 00:06:55.474
And I, myself, have been
very excited about it.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.640
We did a report:
"How to Make Nuclear Cheap."

00:06:57.664 --> 00:07:00.562
In particular, the thorium reactor
shows a lot of promise.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.690
So when the climate
scientist, James Hansen,

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.983
asked if I wanted to go to China with him

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.391
and look at the Chinese
advanced nuclear program,

00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:08.665
I jumped at the chance.

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.880
We were there with MIT
and UC Berkeley engineers.

00:07:11.904 --> 00:07:13.580
And I had in my mind

00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:15.916
that the Chinese would be able
to do with nuclear

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.987
what they did with so many other things --

00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:21.940
start to crank out small nuclear
reactors on assembly lines,

00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:26.352
ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks
and send them around the world.

00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:28.359
I would get one at home in Berkeley.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.081
But what I found was somewhat different.

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:34.009
The presentations were all
very exciting and very promising;

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:36.519
they have multiple reactors
that they're working on.

00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:39.848
The time came for the thorium reactor,
and a bunch of us were excited.

00:07:39.872 --> 00:07:43.271
They went through the whole presentation,
they got to the timeline,

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:44.552
and they said,

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:48.094
"We're going to have
a thorium molten salt reactor

00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:50.283
ready for sale to the world

00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:51.869
by 2040."

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.463
And I was like, "What?"

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:55.502
(Laughter)

00:07:55.526 --> 00:07:57.534
I looked at my colleagues and I was like,

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.026
"Excuse me --

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.380
can you guys speed that up a little bit?

00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:04.478
Because we're in a little bit
of a climate crisis right now.

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:07.228
And your cities are really
polluted, by the way."

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:09.570
And they responded back, they were like,

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:12.374
"I'm not sure what you've heard
about our thorium program,

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:14.313
but we don't have a third of our budget,

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:17.449
and your department of energy
hasn't been particularly forthcoming

00:08:17.473 --> 00:08:20.954
with all that data you guys
have on testing reactors."

00:08:21.382 --> 00:08:23.740
And I said, "Well, I've got an idea.

00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:27.360
You know how you've got 10 years
where you're demonstrating that reactor?

00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:28.956
Let's just skip that part,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.330
and let's just go right
to commercializing it.

00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:33.000
That will save money and time."

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:35.971
And the engineer just
looked at me and said,

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:37.621
"Let me ask you a question:

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:41.163
Would you buy a car that had never
been demonstrated before?"

00:08:41.913 --> 00:08:43.510
So what about the other reactors?

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:46.986
There's a reactor that's coming online
now, they're starting to sell it.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.796
It's a high-temperature gas reactor.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.083
It can't melt down.

00:08:50.845 --> 00:08:53.580
But it's really big and bulky,
that's part of the safety,

00:08:53.604 --> 00:08:55.892
and nobody thinks
it's going to ever get cheaper

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:57.856
than the reactors that we have.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.956
The ones that use waste as fuel
are really cool ideas, but the truth is,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.028
we don't actually know how to do that yet.

00:09:04.052 --> 00:09:06.647
There's some risk that you'll
actually make more waste,

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.465
and most people think
that if you're including

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:11.571
that waste part of the process,

00:09:11.595 --> 00:09:14.562
it's just going to make the whole
machine a lot more expensive,

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.918
it's just adding another complicated step.

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:19.059
The truth is,

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.845
there's real questions about how much
of that we're going to do.

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:25.755
I mean, we went to India and asked
about the nuclear program.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:28.177
The government said
before the Paris climate talks

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.257
that they were going to do something
like 30 new nuclear plants.

00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:33.352
But when we got there
and interviewed people

00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:35.457
and even looked at the internal documents,

00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:37.933
they're now saying
they're going to do about five.

00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:40.503
And in most of the world,
especially the rich world,

00:09:40.527 --> 00:09:42.813
they're not talking
about building new reactors.

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:45.125
We're actually talking
about taking reactors down

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:46.815
before their lifetimes are over.

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:49.627
Germany's actually pressuring
its neighbors to do that.

00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:51.458
I mentioned the United States --

00:09:51.482 --> 00:09:55.825
we could lose half of our reactors
over the next 15 years,

00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:58.666
which would wipe out 40 percent
of the emissions reductions

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.034
we're supposed to get
under the Clean Power Plan.

00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:04.125
Of course, in Japan, they took
all their nuclear plants offline,

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:06.502
replaced them with coal,
natural gas, oil burning,

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:10.088
and they're only expected to bring
online about a third to two-thirds.

00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:12.657
So when we went through the numbers,

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:14.004
and just added that up --

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:17.149
how much nuclear do we see
China and India bringing online

00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:19.135
over the next 15 years,

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:22.715
how much do we see at risk
of being taken offline --

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:25.028
this was the most startling finding.

00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:28.543
What we found is that
the world is actually at risk

00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:34.031
of losing four times more clean energy
than we lost over the last 10 years.

00:10:34.055 --> 00:10:37.405
In other words: we're not
in a clean energy revolution;

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.539
we're in a clean energy crisis.

00:10:40.992 --> 00:10:45.164
So it's understandable that engineers
would look for a technical fix

00:10:45.188 --> 00:10:47.142
to the fears that people have of nuclear.

00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:49.942
But when you consider
that these are big challenges to do,

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:52.251
that they're going to take
a long time to solve,

00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:54.021
there's this other issue, which is:

00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:57.352
Are those technical fixes
really going to solve people's fears?

00:10:57.828 --> 00:10:59.386
Let's take safety.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.895
You know, despite what people think,

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:05.052
it's hard to figure out how
to make nuclear power much safer.

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:07.394
I mean, every medical
journal that looks at it --

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:10.526
this is the most recent study
from the British journal, "Lancet,"

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.003
one of the most respected
journals in the world --

00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:15.546
nuclear is the safest way
to make reliable power.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.351
Everybody's scared of the accidents.

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:19.669
So you go look at the accident data --

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:21.188
Fukushima, Chernobyl --

00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:23.915
the World Health Organization
finds the same thing:

00:11:23.939 --> 00:11:27.914
the vast majority of harm
is caused by people panicking,

00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:30.258
and they're panicking
because they're afraid.

00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:31.507
In other words,

00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.064
the harm that's caused
isn't actually caused by the machines

00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:36.469
or the radiation.

00:11:36.493 --> 00:11:38.222
It's caused by our fears.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.018
And what about the waste?

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:41.634
Everyone worries about the waste.

00:11:41.658 --> 00:11:43.841
Well, the interesting
thing about the waste

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:45.284
is how little of it there is.

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:46.685
This is just from one plant.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:50.086
If you take all the nuclear waste
we've ever made in the United States,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.309
put it on a football field, stacked it up,

00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:54.556
it would only reach 20 feet high.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.854
And people say it's poisoning
people or doing something --

00:11:57.878 --> 00:12:00.777
it's not, it's just sitting
there, it's just being monitored.

00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:02.188
There's not very much of it.

00:12:02.212 --> 00:12:06.035
By contrast, the waste that we don't
control from energy production --

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.183
we call it "pollution," and it kills
seven million people a year,

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:12.036
and it's threatening very serious
levels of global warming.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.012
And the truth is that even if we get
good at using that waste as fuel,

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.311
there's always going to be
some fuel left over.

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:22.206
That means there's always going to be
people that think it's a big problem

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.534
for reasons that maybe don't have
as much to do with the actual waste

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:26.827
as we think.

00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:28.596
Well, what about the weapons?

00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:32.345
Maybe the most surprising thing
is that we can't find any examples

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.322
of countries that have nuclear power

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:36.774
and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.500
In fact, it works the opposite.

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.690
What we find is the only way we know

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:43.166
how to get rid large numbers
of nuclear weapons

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.990
is by using the plutonium in the warheads

00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:48.466
as fuel in our nuclear power plants.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.404
And so, if you are wanting to get
the world rid of nuclear weapons,

00:12:52.428 --> 00:12:55.090
then we're going to need
a lot more nuclear power.

00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:58.828
(Applause)

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:02.881
As I was leaving China,

00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:06.094
the engineer that brought Bill Gates there
kind of pulled me aside,

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:08.899
and he said, "You know, Michael,
I appreciate your interest

00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:11.630
in all the different nuclear
supply technologies,

00:13:11.654 --> 00:13:14.576
but there's this more basic issue,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.139
which is that there's just not
enough global demand.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.088
I mean, we can crank out
these machines on assembly lines,

00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:21.856
we do know how to make things cheap,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.278
but there's just not enough
people that want them."

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:29.244
And so, let's do solar and wind
and efficiency and conservation.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:31.552
Let's accelerate the advanced
nuclear programs.

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:34.729
I think we should triple the amount
of money we're spending on it.

00:13:35.054 --> 00:13:37.443
But I just think the most important thing,

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:39.623
if we're going to overcome
the climate crisis,

00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:44.260
is to keep in mind that the cause
of the clean energy crisis

00:13:44.922 --> 00:13:47.181
isn't from within our machines,

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:49.013
it's from within ourselves.

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:50.808
Thank you very much.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:57.353
(Applause)
