00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.612
Everyone needs a coach.

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:18.713
It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:21.991
a tennis player, a gymnast

00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.212
or a bridge player.

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:26.701
(Laughter)

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.160
My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.415
says there are more pictures of the back of her head

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.932
than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:38.594
Sorry, Sharon. Here you go.

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.185
We all need people who will give us feedback.

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.422
That's how we improve.

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:47.402
Unfortunately, there's one group of people

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.208
who get almost no systematic feedback

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.393
to help them do their jobs better,

00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:53.792
and these people

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:56.942
have one of the most important jobs in the world.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.171
I'm talking about teachers.

00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:01.110
When Melinda and I learned

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.322
how little useful feedback most teachers get,

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:06.276
we were blown away.

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:10.400
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.053
just got one word of feedback:

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.773
Satisfactory.

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:18.266
If all my bridge coach ever told me

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.651
was that I was "satisfactory,"

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:23.428
I would have no hope of ever getting better.

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:26.726
How would I know who was the best?

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:30.326
How would I know what I was doing differently?

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.710
Today, districts are revamping

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.994
the way they evaluate teachers,

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.303
but we still give them almost no feedback

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:41.476
that actually helps them improve their practice.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.808
Our teachers deserve better.

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:48.036
The system we have today isn't fair to them.

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:49.857
It's not fair to students,

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:54.887
and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:58.346
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:02.604
get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:06.470
Let's start by asking who's doing well.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.938
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:11.864
for teacher feedback systems.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.654
So I looked at the countries

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:16.759
whose students perform well academically,

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.064
and looked at what they're doing

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.103
to help their teachers improve.

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:25.336
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:27.826
The U.S. isn't number one.

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.881
We're not even in the top 10.

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:34.819
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.045
Now, out of all the places

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:39.635
that do better than the U.S. in reading,

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:42.174
how many of them have a formal system

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:45.165
for helping teachers improve?

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.000
Eleven out of 14.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.565
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:55.166
but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.250
So there's really only one area where we're near the top,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.422
and that's in failing to give our teachers

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:04.043
the help they need to develop their skills.

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:07.600
Let's look at the best academic performer:

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.765
the province of Shanghai, China.

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:14.098
Now, they rank number one across the board,

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:17.017
in reading, math and science,

00:03:17.017 --> 00:03:20.388
and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:24.022
is the way they help teachers keep improving.

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:26.351
They made sure that younger teachers

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.018
get a chance to watch master teachers at work.

00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:32.292
They have weekly study groups,

00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:35.126
where teachers get together and talk about what's working.

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:38.481
They even require each teacher to observe

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:41.619
and give feedback to their colleagues.

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.318
You might ask, why is a system like this so important?

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:48.176
It's because there's so much variation

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:50.257
in the teaching profession.

00:03:50.257 --> 00:03:54.414
Some teachers are far more effective than others.

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:57.103
In fact, there are teachers throughout the country

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:00.656
who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:02.899
If today's average teacher

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.495
could become as good as those teachers,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.671
our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.578
So we need a system that helps all our teachers

00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:14.590
be as good as the best.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.187
What would that system look like?

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:19.212
Well, to find out, our foundation

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:21.663
has been working with 3,000 teachers

00:04:21.663 --> 00:04:23.847
in districts across the country

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:28.066
on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:30.417
We had observers watch videos

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:32.163
of teachers in the classroom

00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:35.751
and rate how they did on a range of practices.

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:37.589
For example, did they ask their students

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:39.680
challenging questions?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.997
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:48.497
We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.210
"Does your teacher know

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.767
when the class understands a lesson?"

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:55.923
"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"

00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:58.752
And what we found is very exciting.

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:02.871
First, the teachers who did well on these observations

00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:05.322
had far better student outcomes.

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:08.580
So it tells us we're asking the right questions.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.393
And second, teachers in the program told us

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:14.943
that these videos and these surveys from the students

00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:17.626
were very helpful diagnostic tools,

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:20.255
because they pointed to specific places

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:22.283
where they can improve.

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:26.326
I want to show you what this video component of MET

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.910
looks like in action.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.857
(Music)

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.538
(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:35.706
Let's talk about what's going on today.

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:39.055
To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?

00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:41.510
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.393
is for you to be able to determine

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:46.347
whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.

00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:47.816
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.

00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:49.501
I am a high school English teacher

00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:51.564
at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:53.311
Turn to somebody next to you.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.110
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about --

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.771
I think that there is a difference for teachers

00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:02.244
between the abstract of how we see our practice

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:03.887
and then the concrete reality of it.

00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:07.437
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:10.080
I think what video offers for us

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.394
is a certain degree of reality.

00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:15.030
You can't really dispute what you see on the video,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.989
and there is a lot to be learned from that,

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.918
and there are a lot of ways that we can grow

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.849
as a profession when we actually get to see this.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.842
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod

00:06:25.842 --> 00:06:29.252
and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.

00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:31.760
At the beginning of class, I just perch it

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.185
in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.923
It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.

00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:40.203
But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.

00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:42.252
And I'm able to learn a lot from it.

00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:45.137
So it really has been a simple

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:47.983
but powerful tool in my own reflection.

00:06:47.983 --> 00:06:51.032
All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:53.800
Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.436
and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.548
If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.

00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:02.203
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,

00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:06.290
and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.319
I really have used it for my own personal growth

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.245
and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:14.514
and methodology and classroom management,

00:07:14.514 --> 00:07:18.020
and just all of those different facets of the classroom.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.694
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before

00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:23.219
so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:26.544
I think that video exposes

00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:30.028
so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers

00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:33.185
in ways that help us learn and help us understand,

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:35.792
and then help our broader communities understand

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:39.628
what this complex work is really all about.

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:43.760
I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.675
things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.828
things you cannot convey in a standard,

00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:51.057
things that you cannot even sometimes convey

00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:53.867
in a book of pedagogy.

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.233
Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:57.469
I'll see you later.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.756
[Every classroom could look like that]

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:05.183
(Applause)

00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:08.155
Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.839
to look something like that.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.460
But we still have more work to do.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.180
Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.767
is only half the battle.

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:21.152
We also have to give them the tools they need

00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:23.650
to act on the diagnosis.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.565
If you learn that you need to improve

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:27.306
the way you teach fractions,

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.814
you should be able to watch a video

00:08:29.814 --> 00:08:33.526
of the best person in the world teaching fractions.

00:08:33.526 --> 00:08:36.268
So building this complete teacher feedback

00:08:36.268 --> 00:08:39.378
and improvement system won't be easy.

00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.388
For example, I know some teachers

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:43.856
aren't immediately comfortable with the idea

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:46.656
of a camera in the classroom.

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:49.972
That's understandable, but our experience with MET

00:08:49.972 --> 00:08:53.417
suggests that if teachers manage the process,

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:55.902
if they collect video in their own classrooms,

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:58.878
and they pick the lessons they want to submit,

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:02.639
a lot of them will be eager to participate.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:05.592
Building this system will also require

00:09:05.592 --> 00:09:08.615
a considerable investment.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:11.972
Our foundation estimates that it could cost

00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:14.127
up to five billion dollars.

00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:18.481
Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,

00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:20.474
it's less than two percent

00:09:20.474 --> 00:09:24.769
of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:28.081
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.

00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:32.038
We would finally have a way to give them feedback,

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.735
as well as the means to act on it.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:35.920
But this system would have

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.710
an even more important benefit for our country.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.883
It would put us on a path to making sure

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:46.082
all our students get a great education,

00:09:46.082 --> 00:09:48.773
find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:52.012
and have a chance to live out their dreams.

00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:56.366
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.

00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:01.870
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.605
I'm excited about the opportunity

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:09.354
to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.

00:10:09.354 --> 00:10:11.081
I hope you are too.

00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:12.852
Thank you.

00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:21.160
