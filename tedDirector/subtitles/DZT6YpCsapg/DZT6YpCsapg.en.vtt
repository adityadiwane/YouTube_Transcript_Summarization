00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Let me begin with four words

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that will provide the context for this week,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
four words that will come to define

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
this century.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Here they are:

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
The Earth is full.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It's full of us, it's full of our stuff,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
full of our waste, full of our demands.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Yes, we are a brilliant and creative species,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.260
but we've created a little too much stuff --

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
so much that our economy is now bigger

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
than its host, our planet.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
This is not a philosophical statement,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
this is just science

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
based in physics,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
chemistry and biology.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
There are many science-based analyses of this,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
but they all draw the same conclusion --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that we're living beyond our means.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
to sustain this economy.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
In other words,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
to keep operating at our current level,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
we need 50 percent more Earth than we've got.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
In financial terms,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
going further into debt every year.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
But of course, you can't borrow natural resources,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
so we're burning through our capital,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
or stealing from the future.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So when I say full, I mean really full --

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
well past any margin for error,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
well past any dispute

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
about methodology.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
or that it's bad for polar bears or forests,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
though it certainly is.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
What I'm saying

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
is our approach is simply unsustainable.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
In other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
when things aren't sustainable, they stop.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
But that's not possible, you might think.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
We can't stop economic growth.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It will stop because of the growing demand of us

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
on all the resources, all the capacity,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
all the systems of the Earth,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
which is now having economic damage.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
When we think about economic growth stopping,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
we go, "That's not possible,"

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
because economic growth is so essential to our society

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that is is rarely questioned.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
it is an idea so essential

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
that we tend not to understand

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
the possibility of it not being around.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Even though it has delivered many benefits,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
it is based on a crazy idea --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
the crazy idea being

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that we can have infinite growth

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
on a finite planet.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
That the crazy idea is just that,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
it is crazy,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and with the Earth full, it's game over.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Come on, you're thinking.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
That's not possible.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Technology is amazing. People are innovative.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
We can surely sort this out.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
That's all true.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Well, it's mostly true.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
We are certainly amazing,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and we regularly solve complex problems

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
with amazing creativity.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So if our problem

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
was to get the human economy down

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
from 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth's capacity,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
we could do that.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
The problem is we're just warming up

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
this growth engine.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
We plan to take this highly-stressed economy

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and make it twice as big

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and then make it four times as big --

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
not in some distant future,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
but in less than 40 years,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in the life time of most of you.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
China plans to be there in just 20 years.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
The only problem with this plan

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
is that it's not possible.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
In response, some people argue,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
We need it to develop technology.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
We need it to keep social stability.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
I find this argument fascinating,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to suit our needs.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Mother nature doesn't negotiate;

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
she just sets rules and describes consequences.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And these are not esoteric limits.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
This is about food and water, soil and climate,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the basic practical and economic foundations

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
of our lives.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So the idea that we can smoothly transition

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to a highly-efficient,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
solar-powered, knowledge-based economy

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
transformed by science and technology

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
so that nine billion people

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
can live in 2050

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
a life of abundance and digital downloads

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
is a delusion.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
It's not that it's not possible to feed, clothe and house us all

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and have us live decent lives.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
It certainly is.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
But the idea that we can gently grow there

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
with a few minor hiccups

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
is just wrong,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and it's dangerously wrong,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
because it means we're not getting ready

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
for what's really going to happen.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
See what happens when you operate a system

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
past its limits

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and then keep on going

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
at an ever-accelerating rate

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.260
is that the system stops working and breaks down.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And that's what will happen to us.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Many of you will be thinking,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
but surely we can still stop this.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
If it's that bad, we'll react.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Let's just think through that idea.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Now we've had

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
50 years of warnings.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
We've had science proving

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
the urgency of change.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
We've had economic analysis pointing out

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
that, not only can we afford it,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
it's cheaper to act early.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And yet, the reality is

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
we've done pretty much nothing to change course.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
We're not even slowing down.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Last year on climate, for example,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
we had the highest global emissions ever.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
is all much the same.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I actually don't say this in despair.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
I've done my grieving about the loss.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I accept where we are.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
It is sad,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
but it is what it is.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
But it is also time

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
that we ended our denial

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and recognized

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that we're not acting, we're not close to acting

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and we're not going to act

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
until this crisis hits the economy.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And that's why the end of growth

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
is the central issue

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and the event that we need to get ready for.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So when does this transition begin?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
When does this breakdown begin?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
In my view, it is well underway.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
I know most people don't see it that way.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
We tend to look at the world,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
not as the integrated system that it is,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
but as a series of individual issues.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We see the Occupy protests,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
we see spiraling debt crises,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
we see growing inequality,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
we see money's influence on politics,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
we see resource constraint, food and oil prices.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
as individual problems to be solved.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
In fact, it's the system

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
in the painful process of breaking down --

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
our system, of debt-fueled economic growth,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
of ineffective democracy,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of overloading planet Earth,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
is eating itself alive.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.260
I could give you countless studies

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and evidence to prove this,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
but I won't because, if you want to see it,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that evidence is all around you.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
I want to talk to you about fear.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I want to do so because, in my view,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.260
the most important issue we face

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
is how we respond

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to this question.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
The crisis is now inevitable.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.260
This issue is, how will we react?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Of course, we can't know what will happen.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
The future is inherently uncertain.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
But let's just think through what the science is telling us

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
is likely to happen.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Imagine our economy

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
when the carbon bubble bursts,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
when the financial markets recognize

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that, to have any hope

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
of preventing the climate spiraling out of control,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.260
the oil and coal industries are finished.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Imagine China, India and Pakistan going to war

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
as climate impacts

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
generate conflict over food and water.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Imagine the Middle East without oil income,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
but with collapsing governments.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Imagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and supermarket shelves emptying.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Imagine 30 percent unemployment in America

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
as the global economy is gripped

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
by fear and uncertainty.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Now imagine what that means for you,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
your family, your friends,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
your personal financial security.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Imagine what it means

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
for your personal security

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
as a heavily armed civilian population

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
gets angrier and angrier

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
about why this was allowed to happen.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Imagine what you'll tell your children

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
when they ask you,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
"So, in 2012, Mom and Dad,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
what was it like

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
when you'd had the hottest decade on record

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
for the third decade in a row,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
when every scientific body in the world was saying

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
you've got a major problem,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
when the oceans were acidifying,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
when oil and food prices were spiking,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
when they were rioting in the streets of London

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and occupying Wall Street?

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
When the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
what did you do, what were you thinking?"

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So how do you feel

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
when the lights go out

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
on the global economy in your mind,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
when your assumptions about the future

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
fade away

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and something very different emerges?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Just take a moment

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and take a breath

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and think, what do you feel

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
at this point?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Perhaps denial.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Perhaps anger.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Maybe fear.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Of course, we can't know what's going to happen

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and we have to live with uncertainty.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
we should feel a bit of fear.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
We are in danger, all of us,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
to motivate a powerful response,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to help us bravely face a threat.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
You can't see the danger at your door.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
But if you look,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.260
you can see it at the door of your civilization.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
because if we wait until the crisis takes hold,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
we may panic and hide.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
If we feel it now and think it through,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
we will realize we have nothing to fear

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
but fear itself.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Yes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon --

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
certainly in our lifetime --

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
but we are more than capable

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
of getting through everything that's coming.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
You see, those people that have faith

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that humans can solve any problem,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
are in fact right.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
The only thing they're missing

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
is that it takes a good crisis to get us going.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
When we feel fear and we fear loss

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
we are capable of quite extraordinary things.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Think about war.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
for the government to ban the production of civilian cars

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and to redirect the auto industry,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and from there to rationing of food and energy.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Think about how an individual responds

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and how lifestyle changes

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that previously were just too difficult

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.260
suddenly become relatively easy.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
We are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but we do love a good crisis.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And the good news, this one's a monster.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
(Laughter)

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Sure, if we get it wrong,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
we could face the end of this civilization,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
but if we get it right,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
it could be the beginning of civilization instead.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And how cool would it be

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.260
There's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Scientists like James Hansen tell us

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
in just a few decades.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
I wanted to know what that would take,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
to find the answer.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.260
We developed a plan called "The One Degree War Plan" --

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
To my surprise,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
not very cheap,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
We didn't calculate that precisely,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
but we understand that's very expensive.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
You can read the details,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
but in summary, we can transform our economy.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
We can do it with proven technology.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
We can do it at an affordable cost.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
We can do it with existing political structures.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
The only thing we need to change

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
is how we think and how we feel.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And this is where you come in.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
When we think about the future I paint,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
of course we should feel a bit of fear.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
We need to act

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
like the future depends on it.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
We need to act like we only have one planet.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
We can do this.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
that more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
is the best we can do.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
They're wrong.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
We can be more,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
we can be much more.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
We have achieved remarkable things

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
We've built a powerful foundation

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
of science, knowledge and technology --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
more than enough to build a society

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
where nine billion people

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
can lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
The Earth can support that

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
if we choose the right path.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
We can choose this moment of crisis

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution --

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
like, what do we want to be when we grow up,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
when we move past this bumbling adolescence

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
where we think there are no limits

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
and suffer delusions of immortality?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Well it's time to grow up,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
to be wiser, to be calmer,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to be more considered.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Like generations before us,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
we'll be growing up in war --

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
not a war between civilizations,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
but a war for civilization,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
for the extraordinary opportunity

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
to build a society

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
which is stronger and happier

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and plans on staying around

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
into middle age.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
We can choose life over fear.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.260
We can do what we need to do,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
but it will take every entrepreneur,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
every artist,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
every scientist, every communicator,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
every mother, every father, every child,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
every one of us.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
This could be our finest hour.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Thank you.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:40.260
(Applause)
