00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a neuroscientist.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
And in neuroscience,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
But I want to start with the easiest question

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
because it's a fundamental question

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
if we want to understand brain function.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And that is, why do we and other animals

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
have brains?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Not all species on our planet have brains,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
so if we want to know what the brain is for,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
let's think about why we evolved one.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Now you may reason that we have one

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to perceive the world or to think,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and that's completely wrong.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
If you think about this question for any length of time,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
We have a brain for one reason and one reason only,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
There is no other reason to have a brain.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Think about it.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Movement is the only way you have

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
of affecting the world around you.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But apart from that,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
everything else goes through contractions of muscles.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
So think about communication --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
speech, gestures, writing, sign language --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So it's really important to remember

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
but they're only important

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to either drive or suppress future movements.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
There can be no evolutionary advantage

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
to laying down memories of childhood

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
or perceiving the color of a rose

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Now for those who don't believe this argument,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
but the clinching evidence is this animal here --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
the humble sea squirt.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Rudimentary animal, has a nervous system,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And at some point of its life,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
it implants on a rock.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
is to digest its own brain and nervous system

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
for food.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So once you don't need to move,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
you don't need the luxury of that brain.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And this animal is often taken

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
as an analogy to what happens at universities

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
when professors get tenure,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
but that's a different subject.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Applause)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So I am a movement chauvinist.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I believe movement is the most important function of the brain --

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
don't let anyone tell you that it's not true.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Now if movement is so important,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
how well are we doing

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
understanding how the brain controls movement?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
But we can look at how well we're doing

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
by thinking about how well we're doing building machines

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
which can do what humans can do.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Think about the game of chess.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
against IBM's Deep Blue,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
That problem is solved.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
What about the problem

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
of picking up a chess piece,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
the answer is simple:

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
the child wins easily.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
There's no competition at all.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Now why is that top problem so easy

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and the bottom problem so hard?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
One reason is a very smart five year-old

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
could tell you the algorithm for that top problem --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
look at all possible moves to the end of the game

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and choose the one that makes you win.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So it's a very simple algorithm.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Now of course there are other moves,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
but with vast computers we approximate

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and come close to the optimal solution.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
When it comes to being dexterous,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
which has a lot of problems.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So this is the end of a Ph.D. project

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
from one of the best robotics institutes.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And the student has trained this robot

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
to pour this water into a glass.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Now if you want this robot to do a different task,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that's another three-year Ph.D. program.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
There is no generalization at all

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
from one task to another in robotics.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Now we can compare this

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to cutting-edge human performance.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
winning the world record for cup stacking.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It's a high school sport

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
against the clock in a prescribed order.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And this is her getting the world record in real time.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.260
(Laughter)

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
(Applause)

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And she's pretty happy.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and that's what we'd like to know.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
So in my group, what we try to do

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
is reverse engineer how humans control movement.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And it sounds like an easy problem.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Your arm or body moves,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
The trouble is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Now by noise, I do not mean sound.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that was the noise.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So for example, if you put your hand under a table

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and try to localize it with your other hand,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
you can be off by several centimeters

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
due to the noise in sensory feedback.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Similarly, when you put motor output on movement output,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
it's extremely noisy.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
just aim for the same spot over and over again.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
You have a huge spread due to movement variability.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And more than that, the outside world, or task,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
is both ambiguous and variable.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
The teapot could be full, it could be empty.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
It changes over time.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Now this noise is so great

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that society places a huge premium

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
our society will be willing to reward you

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
with hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Now what I want to convince you of

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
is the brain also goes through a lot of effort

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to reduce the negative consequences

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
of this sort of noise and variability.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
called Bayesian decision theory.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And it's more recently a unifying way

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
So let's think about the inference.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
You want to generate beliefs about the world.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
So what are beliefs?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Beliefs could be: where are my arms in space?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Am I looking at a cat or a fox?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
So we're going to represent a belief

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
with a number between zero and one --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And the key idea to Bayesian inference

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
is you have two sources of information

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
from which to make your inference.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
You have data,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and data in neuroscience is sensory input.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
But there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the point about Bayesian decision theory

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
is it gives you the mathematics

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
of the optimal way to combine

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
to generate new beliefs.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And I've put the formula up there.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
is the probability of different beliefs

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
given your sensory input.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So let me give you an intuitive example.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Imagine you're learning to play tennis

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
as it comes over the net towards you.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
There are two sources of information

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Bayes' rule tells you.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
But you know that your senses are not perfect,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
shown by that cloud of red,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
That information is available in the current shot,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
but there's another source of information

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
not available on the current shot,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and that's that the ball doesn't bounce

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
with equal probability over the court during the match.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
If you're playing against a very good opponent,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
they may distribute it in that green area,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
which is the prior distribution,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
making it hard for you to return.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Now both these sources of information carry important information.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And what Bayes' rule says

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and that's my belief.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
So it's the optimal way of combining information.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
we showed this is exactly what people do

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
when they learn new movement skills.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And what it means

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
is we really are Bayesian inference machines.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.260
As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
but we also learn

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and then combine those

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
in a real Bayesian way.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And what this part really says

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
is I have to predict the probability

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
of different sensory feedbacks

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
given my beliefs.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
of the sensory feedback it's going to get.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
by what you do.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And to do that, I'll tell you

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
about how the brain deals with sensory input.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
So you send a command out,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
you get sensory feedback back,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and that transformation is governed

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
But you can imagine looking inside the brain.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And here's inside the brain.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
of the physics of your body and your senses.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
So as you send a movement command down,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
you tap a copy of that off

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
and run it into your neural simulator

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.260
to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
So as I shake this ketchup bottle,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Well why would I bother doing that?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
I'm going to get the same feedback anyway.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Well there's good reasons.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Now I get an extra source of sensory information

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
due to that external act.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So I get two sources.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
but from my senses' point of view,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that is combined together into one source of information.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Now there's good reason to believe

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
than feeling everything that's going on inside my body.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So one way to reconstruct that

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
is to compare the prediction --

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
which is only based on your movement commands --

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
with the reality.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
So as I go around the world,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Everything left over is external to me.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
What evidence is there for this?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Well there's one very clear example

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
where a sensation generated by myself feels very different

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
then if generated by another person.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And so we decided the most obvious place to start

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
was with tickling.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
as well as other people can.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
But it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
simulating your own body

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and subtracting off that sense.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
by applying robotic technologies to this problem.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and they're going to move that back and forward.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And then we're going to track that with a computer

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and use it to control another robot,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
which is going to tickle their palm with another stick.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
including ticklishness.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
I'll show you just one part of our study.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And here I've taken away the robots,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Either no time delay,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
in which case light would just tickle your palm,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.260
or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So the important point here

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
All we're playing with is a tempo causality.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And as we go from naught to 0.1 second,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
it becomes more ticklish.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
As you go from 0.1 to 0.2,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
it becomes more ticklish at the end.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And by 0.2 of a second,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
it's equivalently ticklish

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
So whatever is responsible for this cancellation

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
that the brain's making precise predictions

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and subtracting them off from the sensations.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Now I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
you need large numbers of subjects

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
with these stars making them significant.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So we were looking for a much more objective way

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
to assess this phenomena.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
And in the intervening years I had two daughters.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
they get into fights --

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
which started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
It quickly escalates.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
Now when I screamed at my children to stop,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
sometimes they would both say to me

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
the other person hit them harder.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Now I happen to know my children don't lie,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
so I thought, as a neuroscientist,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
it was important how I could explain

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
how they were telling inconsistent truths.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And we hypothesize based on the tickling study

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
that when one child hits another,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
they generate the movement command.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
rather like the tickling.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Whereas the passive recipient

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
doesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
So if they retaliate with the same force,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
the first person will think it's been escalated.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
So we decided to test this in the lab.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
(Laughter)

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Now we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
but the concept is identical.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And the game is very simple.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
We started with a motor

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
with a little lever, a little force transfuser.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
for three seconds and then it stops.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and use your other finger

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
to apply the same force

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Use your other hand to apply the force back down.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
And so they take it in turns

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
But critically,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And what we've measured

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
is the force as a function of terms.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And if we look at what we start with,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
perfect would be that red line.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this --

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
a 70 percent escalation in force

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
on each go.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
So it really suggests, when you're doing this --

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
based on this study and others we've done --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
and underestimating the force it's producing.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and fundamentally changes the precepts.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
So we've made inferences, we've done predictions,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
now we have to generate actions.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
the action should in some sense be optimal.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
But we've got a problem.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance --

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
in a particular sequence.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
And there's a big gap

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
between the task and the movement system.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
So think about just a point to point movement.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
I could choose these two paths

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
out of an infinite number of paths.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Having chosen a particular path,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
I can hold my hand on that path

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
as infinitely many different joint configurations.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
either very stiff or very relaxed.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
So I have a huge amount of choice to make.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Now it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
We all move the same way pretty much.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
And so it turns out we're so stereotypical,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
to decode this stereotyping.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
So if I take some dots

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and set them in motion with biological motion,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Now this is a bunch of dots moving.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
You will know what this person is doing,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
you would have absolutely no idea what's going on.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
So why is it

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that we move the particular ways we do?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Well let's think about what really happens.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Maybe there's variation in the population.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
And maybe those who move better than others

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
So in evolutionary scales, movements get better.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
So what is it about a movement which is good or bad?

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
Imagine I want to intercept this ball.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Here are two possible paths to that ball.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Well if I choose the left-hand path,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
I can work out the forces required

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
in one of my muscles as a function of time.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
But there's noise added to this.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
So what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
is a very noisy version.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
So if I pick the same command through many times,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
So what I can show you here

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
is how the variability of the movement will evolve

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
if I choose that way.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example --

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
then I'll have a different command, different noise,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
playing through a noisy system, very complicated.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
All we can be sure of is the variability will be different.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
If I move in this particular way,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
I end up with a smaller variability across many movements.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
So if I have to choose between those two,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
I would choose the right one because it's less variable.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
And the fundamental idea

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
is you want to plan your movements

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
And one intuition to get

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
gets bigger as the force gets bigger.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
So we've shown that using this,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
we can explain a huge amount of data --

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
so as to minimize negative consequences of noise.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
and evolved to control movement.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
But it's also relevant

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
for disease and rehabilitation.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
There are many diseases which effect movement.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
And hopefully if we understand how we control movement,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
we can apply that to robotic technology.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
And finally, I want to remind you,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
is really quite dramatic.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:56.260
(Applause)

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.260
So you're a movement -- (DW: Chauvinist.) -- chauvinist.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about --

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
the dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things --

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.260
are a kind of side show, an accident?

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
So I think people who study sensation or memory

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.260
You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.260
CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
could get real insight

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
by saying, where does movement play in this game?

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
DW: So people have found out for example

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
is a mistake.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
You have to study vision with the realization

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
of how the movement system is going to use vision.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.260
CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
(Applause)
