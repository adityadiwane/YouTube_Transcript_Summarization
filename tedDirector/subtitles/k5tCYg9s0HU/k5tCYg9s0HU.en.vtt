00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.190
June 29, 2016.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.002
My dear fellow citizen:

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:25.076
I write to you today,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.949
to you who have lost in this era.

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:35.551
At this moment in our common life,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.820
when the world is full of breaking

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:39.695
and spite

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.505
and fear,

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.129
I address this letter

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:47.644
simply to you,

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.062
even though we both know

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:54.228
there are many of you behind this "you,"

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:59.024
and many of me behind this "I."

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:05.081
I write to you because at present,

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:10.799
this quaking world we share scares me.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.810
I gather it scares you, too.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:19.647
Some of what we fear, I suspect,

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:21.026
we fear in common.

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:26.534
But much of what we fear
seems to be each other.

00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:31.656
You fear the world I want to live in,

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:36.417
and I fear your visions in turn.

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:42.446
Do you know that feeling you get
when you know it's going to storm

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.017
before it storms?

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.469
Do you also feel that now,

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.516
fellow citizen?

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:55.157
That malaise and worry

00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:57.770
that some who know

00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:02.183
feel reminds them of the 1930s?

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:05.747
Perhaps you don't,

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.400
because our fears of each other

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:09.943
are not in sync.

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:14.801
In this round, I sense
that your fears of me,

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.007
of the world that I have insisted
is right for us both,

00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:22.686
has gathered over a generation.

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:28.136
It took time for your fears
to trigger my fears,

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:31.626
not least because at first,

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.355
I never thought I needed to fear you.

00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:38.219
I heard you

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:41.070
but did not listen,

00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:46.728
all these years when you said
that this amazing new world

00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:49.754
wasn't amazing for you,

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.483
for many of you,

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:55.030
across the industrialized world;

00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:58.739
that the open, liquid world I relished,

00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:03.066
of people and goods
and technologies flowing freely,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.530
going where they pleased, globally,

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.279
was not, for you, an emancipation.

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:15.894
I have walked through your towns

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:21.182
and, while looking, failed to see.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.730
I did notice in Stephenville, Texas,

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.098
that the town square was dominated

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:33.365
by one lawyer's office after another,

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:37.395
because of all the people
rotating in and out of the prison.

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:42.302
I did notice the barren shops
in Wagner, South Dakota,

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:47.403
and the VFW gathering hall

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:50.106
that stood in mockery

00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:53.725
of a community's dream to endure.

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:56.566
I did notice

00:03:57.323 --> 00:04:00.748
at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:05.804
that far too many people
in their 20s and 30s

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.335
looked a decade or two from death,

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.641
with patchy, flared-up skin

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:14.141
and thinning, stringy hair

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:15.817
and browning, ground-down teeth

00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:19.102
and a lostness in their eyes.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.770
I did notice that the young people
I encountered in Paris,

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:26.745
in Florence, in Barcelona,

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:30.279
had degrees but no place to take them,

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:34.676
living on internships well into their 30s,

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:38.589
their lives prevented from launching,

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:42.614
because of an economy
that creates wealth --

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:44.748
just not jobs.

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:52.138
I did notice the news about those parts
of London becoming ghost quarters,

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:58.693
where the global super-rich
turn fishy money into empty apartments

00:04:59.962 --> 00:05:04.064
and price lifelong residents of a city,
young couples starting out,

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.803
out of their own home.

00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:11.253
And I heard that the fabric of your life

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.522
was tearing.

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:15.978
You used to be able to count on work,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.169
and now you couldn't.

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:21.817
You used to be able
to nourish your children,

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.420
and guarantee that they would climb

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:29.978
a little bit further in life than you had,

00:05:30.002 --> 00:05:31.295
and now you couldn't.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:37.959
You used to be made to feel dignity
in your work, and now you didn't.

00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:43.191
It used to be normal
for people like you to own a home,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.849
and now it wasn't.

00:05:47.286 --> 00:05:49.466
I cannot say

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:52.217
I didn't know these things,

00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.918
but I was distracted

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.987
creating a future in which
we could live on Mars,

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.451
even as you struggled down here on Earth.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:09.615
I was distracted

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:12.289
innovating immortality,

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:19.312
even as many of you began to live
shorter lives than your parents had.

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.360
I heard all of these things,
but I didn't listen.

00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:26.727
I looked

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:29.137
but didn't see.

00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:32.286
I read, didn't understand.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.576
I paid attention

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.261
only when you began to vote and shout,

00:06:40.428 --> 00:06:43.492
and when your voting and shouting,
when the substance of it,

00:06:43.516 --> 00:06:45.999
began to threaten me.

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:53.228
I listened only when you moved
toward shattering continental unions

00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:55.513
and electing vulgar demagogues.

00:06:56.704 --> 00:07:00.608
Only then did your pain become of interest

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:02.508
to me.

00:07:04.317 --> 00:07:06.271
I know that feeling hurt

00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:09.588
is often prologue to dealing hurt.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.044
I wonder now

00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:16.686
if you would be less eager to deal it

00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:19.378
if I had stood with you

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:21.686
when you merely felt it.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:24.590
I ask myself

00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.448
why I didn't stand with you then.

00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:32.251
One reason is that I became entranced

00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:34.364
by the gurus of change,

00:07:35.187 --> 00:07:39.522
became a worshiper of the religion
of the new for novelty's sake,

00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:41.699
and of globalization and open borders

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.660
and kaleidoscopic diversity.

00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:50.836
Once change became my totalizing faith,

00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:53.817
I could be blind.

00:07:55.143 --> 00:07:58.677
I could fail to see change's consequences.

00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:01.803
I could overlook the importance

00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:04.929
of roots, traditions,
rituals, stability --

00:08:04.953 --> 00:08:06.296
and belonging.

00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:10.816
And the more fundamentalist I became

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.582
in my worship of change and openness,

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.320
the more I drove you
towards the other polarity,

00:08:20.074 --> 00:08:21.234
to cling,

00:08:21.632 --> 00:08:22.789
to freeze,

00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:24.448
to close,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.259
to belong.

00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.854
I now see as I didn't before

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:34.819
that not having
the right skin or right organ

00:08:34.843 --> 00:08:38.766
is not the only varietal of disadvantage.

00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:43.312
There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:46.651
in having those privileged traits

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:51.058
and yet feeling history to be
moving away from you;

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:54.475
that while the past was hospitable
to people like you,

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.897
the future will be more hospitable

00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:58.314
to others;

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:00.791
that the world is growing less familiar,

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.681
less yours day by day.

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:11.547
I will not concede for a moment
that old privileges should not dwindle.

00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:14.801
They cannot dwindle fast enough.

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:19.285
It is for you to learn to live
in a new century in which

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.134
there are no bonuses for showing up
with the right skin and right organs.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:27.704
If and when your anger turns to hate,

00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:31.959
please know that there is no space
for that in our shared home.

00:09:33.642 --> 00:09:36.990
But I will admit, fellow citizen,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.679
that I have discounted the burden
of coping with the loss of status.

00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:45.932
I have forgotten

00:09:45.957 --> 00:09:50.702
that what is socially necessary
can also be personally gruelling.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.424
A similar thing happened

00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:58.841
with the economy that you and I share.

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:02.623
Just as I cannot and don't wish

00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:06.274
to turn back to the clock
on equality and diversity,

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:08.627
and yet must understand

00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.417
the sense of loss they can inspire,

00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:17.185
so, too, I refuse
and could not if I wished

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.111
turn back the clock on an ever more
closely knit, interdependent world,

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:25.525
and on inventions
that won't stop being invented.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.754
And yet I must understand
your experience of these things.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:36.451
You have for years been telling me
that your experience of these things

00:10:36.475 --> 00:10:39.617
is not as good as my theories forecast.

00:10:40.528 --> 00:10:44.386
Yet before you could finish
a complaining sentence

00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:51.604
about the difficulty of living
with erratic hours, volatile pay,

00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:53.254
vanishing opportunities,

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:57.536
about the pain of dropping
your children off at 24-hour day care

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.323
to make your 3am shift,

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:04.232
I shot back at you -- before you
could finish your sentence --

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:05.598
my dogma,

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:10.052
about how what you are actually
experiencing was flexibility

00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:12.080
and freedom.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:19.162
Language is one of the only things
that we truly share,

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:24.028
and I sometimes used
this joint inheritance

00:11:24.052 --> 00:11:25.263
to obfuscate

00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:27.025
and deflect

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.995
and justify myself;

00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:31.813
to re-brand what was good for me

00:11:31.837 --> 00:11:34.629
as something appearing good for us both,

00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:39.310
when I threw around terms
like "the sharing economy,"

00:11:40.135 --> 00:11:41.310
and "disruption"

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:43.690
and "global resourcing."

00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:47.595
I see now that what I was really doing,

00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:49.475
at times,

00:11:49.894 --> 00:11:52.998
was buying your pain on the cheap,

00:11:53.892 --> 00:11:55.104
sprucing it up

00:11:55.772 --> 00:11:57.744
and trying to sell it back to you

00:11:58.244 --> 00:11:59.450
as freedom.

00:12:01.712 --> 00:12:04.971
I have wanted to believe
and wanted you to believe

00:12:07.683 --> 00:12:09.792
that the system that has been good to me,

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:12.489
that has made my life ever more seamless,

00:12:13.229 --> 00:12:16.124
is also the best system for you.

00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:19.805
I have condescended to you

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:23.725
with the idea that you are voting
against your economic interests --

00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:25.995
voting against your interests,

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:30.844
as if I know your interests.

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:36.613
That is just my dogmatic
economism talking.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.500
I have a weakness

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:44.909
for treating people's economic interests
as their only interest,

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:48.457
ignoring things like belonging and pride

00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:52.255
and the desire to send a message
to those who ignore you.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.419
So here we are,

00:12:56.243 --> 00:13:00.869
in a scary but not inexplicable moment

00:13:01.507 --> 00:13:03.830
of demagoguery, fracture,

00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.367
xenophobia, resentment and fear.

00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:13.658
And I worry for us both
if we continue down this road,

00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:15.754
me not listening,

00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.156
you feeling unheard,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.729
you shouting to get me to listen.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:26.230
I worry when each of us is seduced
by visions of the future

00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:28.914
that have no place for the other.

00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:31.819
If this goes on,

00:13:33.655 --> 00:13:35.030
if this goes on,

00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:37.532
there may be blood.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.975
There are already hints of this blood

00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:44.255
in newspapers every day.

00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:47.552
There may be roundups, raids,

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:50.661
deportations, camps, secessions.

00:13:51.494 --> 00:13:54.415
And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.157
There may be even talk of war

00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:01.731
in places that were certain
they were done with it.

00:14:03.483 --> 00:14:07.229
There is always the hope of redemption.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.042
But it will not be a cheap,
shallow redemption

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:14.737
that comes through blather
about us all being in it together.

00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:17.168
This will take more.

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:23.588
It will take accepting that we both
made choices to be here.

00:14:25.863 --> 00:14:28.966
We create our "others."

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:33.655
As parents, as neighbors, as citizens,

00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:38.834
we witness and sometimes ignore each other

00:14:38.858 --> 00:14:40.098
into being.

00:14:41.268 --> 00:14:44.318
You were not born vengeful.

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:47.346
I have some role

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.871
in whatever thirst
you now feel for revenge,

00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:53.598
and that thirst now tempts me

00:14:53.622 --> 00:14:56.140
to plot ever more elaborate escapes

00:14:56.164 --> 00:14:58.083
from our common life,

00:14:58.107 --> 00:14:59.976
from the schools and neighborhoods

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.931
and airports and amusement parks

00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:03.596
that we used to share.

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:08.647
We face, then,

00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:12.445
a problem not of these large,
impersonal forces.

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:18.518
We face a problem
of your and my relations.

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:22.953
We chose ways of relating to each other

00:15:24.345 --> 00:15:25.496
that got us here.

00:15:25.896 --> 00:15:28.645
We can choose ways of relating

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:30.275
that get us out.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:34.630
But there are things
we might have to let go of,

00:15:35.418 --> 00:15:36.599
fellow citizen,

00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:43.280
starting with our own cherished
versions of reality.

00:15:45.035 --> 00:15:48.904
Imagine if you let go of fantasies

00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:52.786
of a society purged
of these or those people.

00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:57.214
Imagine if I let go of my habit

00:15:57.755 --> 00:16:00.825
of saving the world behind your back,

00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:03.230
of deliberating on the future

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.729
of your work,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.506
your food,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.000
your schools,

00:16:08.024 --> 00:16:11.034
in places where you couldn't
get past security.

00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:16.732
We can do this only if we first accept

00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:19.990
that we have neglected each other.

00:16:21.971 --> 00:16:25.185
If there is hope to summon

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.280
in this ominous hour,

00:16:28.202 --> 00:16:29.393
it is this.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.572
We have, for too long,

00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:36.916
chased various shimmering dreams

00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:43.682
at the cost of attention
to the foundational dream of each other,

00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:47.669
the dream of tending to each other,

00:16:47.693 --> 00:16:50.556
of unleashing each other's wonders,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.125
of moving through history together.

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:58.315
We could dare to commit
to the dream of each other

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:03.716
as the thing that matters
before every neon thing.

00:17:04.476 --> 00:17:05.958
Let us dare.

00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:07.627
Sincerely yours,

00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:09.243
a fellow citizen.

00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:15.308
(Applause)
