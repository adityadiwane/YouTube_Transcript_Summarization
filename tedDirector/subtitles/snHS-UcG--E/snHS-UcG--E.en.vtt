00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
What is it about flying cars?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And there are historic attempts

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that have had some level of technical success.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
But we haven't yet gotten to the point

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
where on your way here this morning

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
with the three-dimensional sky above us --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and realized that, despite the fact

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that we have a lot of modern innovations

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
to draw on today

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that weren't available previously --

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
we have modern composite materials,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
we have glass cockpit avionics

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
that bring the information you need to fly

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
directly to you in the cockpit --

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
we realized that we were going to be getting

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
the same result that people had been getting

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
for the last hundred years,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
which isn't where we want to be right now.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
we decided to try to make a plane that could drive.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that works just like any other small airplane.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
You take off and land at a local airport.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Then once you're on the ground,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
you fold up the wings, drive it home,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
park it in your garage.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And it works.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
After two years of an innovative design and construction process,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
the proof of concept made its public debut

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in 2008.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Now like with anything

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that's really different from the status quo,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And we discovered that it's a very good thing

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that, when you go home with something that's been broken,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
you've actually learned a lot more

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
the first time through.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Still, we very much wanted to see

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
the aircraft that we'd all helped build

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in the air, off the ground,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
like it was supposed to be.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And on our third high-speed testing deployment

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
we got to do that for the first time.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And we were all very flattered to see that image

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
become a symbol of accomplishing something

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
that people had thought was impossible

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
really the world over.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
The flight testing that followed that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
was as basic and low-risk as we could make it,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
but it still accomplished what we needed to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
to take the program to the next step

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and to gain the credibility that we needed

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
within our eventual market, the general aviation community,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and with the regulators

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
The FAA, about a year ago,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
gave us an exemption for the Transition

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
within the light sport aircraft category.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
makes it simpler for us to certify it,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
but it also makes it much easier

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
for you to learn how to fly it.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
A sport pilot can be certificated

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
in as little as 20 hours of flight time.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And at 110 lbs.,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
that's very important for solving the other side of the equation --

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
driving.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
It turns out that driving,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
this may be counter-intuitive,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but driving has potholes, cobblestones,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
pedestrians, other drivers

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and a rather long and detailed list

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and a lot of the design work

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that we're the most proud of with the aircraft

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
came out of solving the unique problems

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
of operating it on the ground --

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
everything from a continuously-variable transmission

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and liquid-based cooling system

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that allows us to use an aircraft engine

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
in stop-and-go traffic,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to a custom-designed gearbox

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to crash safety features.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We have a carbon fiber safety cage

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
that protects the occupants

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
The regulations for vehicles on the road

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
weren't written with an airplane in mind.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So we did need a little bit of support

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Now you may have seen in the news recently,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
they came through with us at the end of last month

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
with a few special exemptions

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that will allow the Transition to be sold

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
in the same category as SUVs and light trucks.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
(Laughter)

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Now let's see it in action.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And it is under seven feet tall,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
so it will fit in a standard construction garage.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
That's real time.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Once they're fully deployed,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
there's a mechanical lock that goes into place,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
again, from inside the cockpit.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And they're now fully capable of handling

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
any of the loads you would see in flight --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
just like putting down your convertible top.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
75 percent of your risk is that first flight.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Radio: It actually flew. Yes.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Radio: What did you think of that?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
That was beautiful from up here, I tell you.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
AMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And our test pilot gave us

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
He would go onto tell us

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So despite making something

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that is seemingly revolutionary,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
we really focused on doing

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
as little new as possible.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and from automotive racing.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that lets us reduce risk in baby steps.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
we've had a lot of those baby steps.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
We've gone from being three of us

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to about two-dozen of us

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
working in an initial production facility outside of Boston.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We've had to overcome challenges

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
figuring out how to politely respond

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
when a regulator tells you,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
(Laughter)

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
that we talked about on the ground.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
with the testing and construction

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
of the two production prototypes

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that we're working on right now,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
those first deliveries

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
should begin at the end of next year.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Here's why.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
there is a huge underutilized resource out there.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
There are thousands of local airstrips

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
of wherever you are in the United States.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
The Transition gives you

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
a safer, more convenient and more fun way

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
of using this resource.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
For those of you who aren't yet pilots,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
there's four main reasons why those of us who are

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
don't fly as much as we'd like to:

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the weather, primarily,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
cost, long door-to-door travel time

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and mobility at your destination.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Now, bad weather comes in,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
just land, fold up the wings, drive home.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
park it in your garage.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
is both cheaper and better for the environment

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
than traditional avgas.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Door-to-door travel time is reduced,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Just fold up the wings and keep going.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
while making the world a smaller, more accessible place.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
I hope you'll each take a moment

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
to think about how you could use something like this

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
to give yourself more access to your own world,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.260
(Applause)
