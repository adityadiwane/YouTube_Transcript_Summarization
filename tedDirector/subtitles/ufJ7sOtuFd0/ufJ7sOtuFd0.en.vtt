00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I've been fascinated for a lifetime

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
by the beauty, form and function

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of giant bluefin tuna.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
They're the largest of the tunas,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
They actually are a fish

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that is endothermic --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
it's powered for ocean swimming.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
powers its movements

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
with a lunate tail.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
so it reduces friction with the water.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
This is what one of nature's finest machines.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Now, bluefin

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
were revered by Man

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
for all of human history.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and it's evidenced

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
in the art that we see

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
from thousands of years ago.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
They're on coins

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
that date back 3,000 years.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
This fish was revered by humankind.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It was fished sustainably

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
till all of time,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
except for our generation.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
there is a gold rush on Earth,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and this is a gold rush for bluefin.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
There are traps that fish sustainably

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
up until recently.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And yet, the type of fishing going on today,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
with pens, with enormous stakes,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
is really wiping bluefin

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
ecologically off the planet.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Now bluefin, in general,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
goes to one place: Japan.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Some of you may be guilty

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
They're delectable muscle,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
rich in fat --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
absolutely taste delicious.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
The North American population

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
is fished at about 2,000 ton.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
is fished at tremendous levels:

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The result is whether you're looking

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
at the West or the Eastern bluefin population,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
there's been tremendous decline on both sides,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
as much as 90 percent

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
if you go back with your baseline

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
to 1950.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
For that, bluefin have been given a status

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
equivalent to tigers, to lions,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
to certain African elephants

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and to pandas.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
These fish have been proposed

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
for an endangered species listing in the past two months.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
They were voted on and rejected

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
just two weeks ago,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
despite outstanding science

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that shows from two committees

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And if it's tunas you don't care about,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
perhaps you might be interested

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
that international long lines and pursing

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
chase down tunas and bycatch animals

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
such as leatherbacks, sharks,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
marlin, albatross.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
These animals and their demise

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
occurs in the tuna fisheries.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The challenge we face

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is that we know very little about tuna,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and everyone in the room knows what it looks like

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
when an African lion

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
takes down its prey.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
This tuna symbolizes

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
what's the problem for all of us in the room.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to really study our oceans in a deep way.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Technology has come of age

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that's allowing us to see the Earth from space

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and go deep into the seas remotely.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And we've got to use these technologies immediately

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
to get a better understanding

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
of how our ocean realm works.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Most of us from the ship -- even I --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
We don't know where the structure is.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
We can't tell where are the watering holes

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
like we can on an African plain.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
We can't see the corridors,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and we can't see what it is

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
that brings together a tuna,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
a leatherback and an albatross.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
We're only just beginning to understand

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
how the physical oceanography

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and the biological oceanography

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
come together

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
to create a seasonal force

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that actually causes the upwelling

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
that might make a hot spot a hope spot.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
The reasons these challenges are great

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
the entire Pacific realm.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.260
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and try to put a tag on it.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
getting up close to a blue whale

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
an engineering challenge

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
we've yet to really overcome.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
So the story of our team, a dedicated team,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
is fish and chips.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
We basically are taking

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the same satellite phone parts,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
We're putting them together in unusual ways,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and this is taking us into the ocean realm

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
like never before.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And for the first time,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
using light and photons

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
to measure sunrise and sunset.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
I have the privilege of being a partner

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
put it behind glass,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and we together

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
one of the only places on Earth

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
you can see giant bluefin swim by.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
We can see in their beauty of form and function,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
their ceaseless activity.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
They're flying through their space, ocean space.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And we can bring two million people a year

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
into contact with this fish

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and show them its beauty.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Here, for over 14 or 15 years,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
we've actually brought in

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
We'd been studying these fish,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
What do they like to eat?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
What is it that they're happy with?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And then, better yet,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
we've got our own version of tuna whisperers,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
who can take a big tuna

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and in one motion,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
put it into an envelope of water,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
so that we can actually work with the tuna

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and learn the techniques it takes

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to not injure this fish

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
who never sees a boundary in the open sea.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
who are going to take a tuna

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
its energy consumption.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
We're taking this data and building better models.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I begin to wonder:

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
So take a look at that animal.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Now, the activities from the lab

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
from Corsica to Spain.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
We've fished with many nations around the world

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
in an effort to basically

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
put electronic computers

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
inside giant tunas.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And I'm going to show you three clips,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
because I tagged 1,100 tunas.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
work together to keep this animal out of the ocean

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
for about four to five minutes.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
putting in the computer,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
we send this fish back into the sea.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And when it goes, we're always happy.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
We see a flick of the tail.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And from our data that gets collected,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
when that tag comes back,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
because a fisher returns it

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
for a thousand-dollar reward,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
we can get tracks beneath the sea

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
for up to five years now,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
on a backboned animal.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Now sometimes the tunas are really large,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
such as this fish off Nantucket.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
But that's about half the size

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
It takes a human effort,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
a team effort, to bring the fish in.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
In this case, what we're going to do

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This tag rides on the tuna,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
senses the environment around the tuna

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and actually will come off the fish,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
detach, float to the surface

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
position data estimated by math on the tag,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
pressure data and temperature data.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
is we get away from having to have a human interaction

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
to recapture the tag.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
These tags have been engineered

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
by a variety of teams in North America.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
They are some of our finest instruments,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
our new technology in the ocean today.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
One community in general

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
has given more to help us than any other community.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
every winter for over a decade,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
held a party called Tag-A-Giant,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and together, fishers worked with us

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
to tag 800 to 900 fish.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
take a mucus sample.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
we can get information on gender,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
checking the pop-up tag one more time,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and then it's out in the ocean.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
And this is my favorite.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The warm is the Gulf Stream,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
but it can't get there. It's too cold.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
maybe comes back to home base,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
goes in again

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and then on to the Bahamas.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Three tunas tagged.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
and there it is.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
That is where the tuna spawn.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So from data like this,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
we're able now to put the map up,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and in this map

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
you see thousands of positions

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
generated by this decade and a half of tagging.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
go to the eastern side.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So two populations of tunas --

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and a second population.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
are European tunas that go back to the Med.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
On the hot spots -- the hope spots --

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
they're mixed populations.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
And so what we've done with the science

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
is we're showing the International Commission,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
building new models,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
to this day, used to reject

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
the CITES treaty --

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
that model isn't the right model.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
This model, a model of overlap,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
is the way to move forward.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
So we can then predict

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
where management places should be.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
are places where the single species,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
the single population, can be captured.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
These become forthright in places we need to protect.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
because they manage their fisheries well,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
they're doing a good job.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
But in the international realm,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Now in a second project

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
we took on the planet as a team,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
those of us in the Census of Marine Life.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
we were able to actually go in, in our project --

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
we're one of 17 field programs

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
not just tunas.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
So what we've done

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
met salmon shark on their home territory,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
followed them catching salmon

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and then went in and figured out

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
we can actually take up a salmon shark --

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
This is the cousin of the white shark --

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and very carefully --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
note, I say "very carefully," --

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
we can actually keep it calm,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and then tag it with a satellite tag.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and send in a message.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
jumping after salmon,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
sending home its data.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
Salmon sharks go down

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
to the tropics to pup

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and come into Monterey.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and Sal Jorgensen.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
They can throw out a target --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
it's a carpet shaped like a seal --

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
and in will come a white shark, a curious critter

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
It's a several thousand-pound animal.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
And we'll wind in the target.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And we'll place an acoustic tag

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
that says, "OMSHARK 10165,"

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
or something like that, acoustically with a ping.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And then we'll put on a satellite tag

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
that will give us the long-distance journeys

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
with the light-based geolocation algorithms

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
solved on the computer that's on the fish.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and there they are: the white sharks of California

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
blue sharks.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And now, together, what we can see

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
on this ocean of color that's temperature,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
We have white sharks and blue sharks.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
For the first time,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
showing where the sharks go.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
three teams tagged 1,700 tunas,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
bluefin, yellowfin and albacore

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
all at the same time --

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
carefully rehearsed tagging programs

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
put in the tags that actually have the sensors,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
stick out the tuna

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and then let them go.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
They get returned, and when they get returned,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
here on a NASA numerical ocean

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
you can see bluefin in blue

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
go across their corridor,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
returning to the Western Pacific.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
These elephant seals cover half an ocean,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
take data down to 1,800 feet --

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
amazing data.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
wearing tuna tags, light-based tags,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
journeys of 35,000 nautical miles

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
we had never seen before.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
we can actually see these journeys.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Same thing with Laysan albatross

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
who travel an entire ocean

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
on a trip sometimes,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
up to the same zone the tunas use.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
You can see why they might be caught.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
tagging leatherbacks

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
that go right past where we are.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
And Scott Benson's team

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
all the way to Monterey.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
So what we can see on this moving ocean

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
is we can finally see where the predators are.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
as large as an ocean.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
And from this information,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
we can begin to map the hope spots.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
So this is just three years of data right here --

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and there's a decade of this data.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
that these animals are going on.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
So what we're able to do with this information

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
is boil it down to hot spots,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
4,000 deployments,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
a huge herculean task,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
2,000 tags

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
in an area, shown here for the first time,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
off the California coast,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
that appears to be a gathering place.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
And then for sort of an encore from these animals,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
they're helping us.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
They're carrying instruments

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
They're taking information from our planet

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Those are seals from many countries

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
being released

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
who are sampling underneath the ice sheets

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
on both poles.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
And then, as these animals swim

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
and give us the information

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
that's important to climate issues,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
we also think it's critical

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
to get this information to the public,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
to engage the public with this kind of data.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
We did this with the Great Turtle Race --

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
And now with Google's Oceans,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
And when we do and it swims,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
we see this magnificent bathymetry

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
that the shark knows is there on its path

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
as it goes from California to Hawaii.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
But maybe Mission Blue

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
can fill in that ocean that we can't see.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
We just need to put it together.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
So in conclusion,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
we know where Yellowstone is for North America;

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
it's off our coast.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
is increasing the biologging capacity.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
How is it that we can actually

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
take this type of activity elsewhere?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
And then finally -- to basically get the message home --

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
maybe use live links

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
Make killer apps, if you will.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
A lot of people are excited

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
That way we do away with a few internet myths.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
So we can save the bluefin tuna.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
We can save the white shark.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
We have the science and technology.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
Hope is here. Yes we can.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
We need just to apply this capacity

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
further in the oceans.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
Thank you.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
(Applause)
