00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
quickly how to predict,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and illustrate it with some predictions

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330
about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
In order to predict effectively,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
we need to use science.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And the reason that we need to use science

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
it's not just wisdom or guesswork.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And if we can predict,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
then we can engineer the future.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.330
or you are concerned to influence national security policy,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
or health policy, or education,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
science -- and a particular branch of science -- is a way to do it,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
not the way we've been doing it,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
Now before I get into how to do it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
let me give you a little truth in advertising,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
because I'm not engaged in the business of magic.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
and there are some that it can't.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
It can predict complex negotiations

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
or situations involving coercion --

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
that is in essence everything that has to do with politics,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
much of what has to do with business,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.330
but sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
I don't predict stock markets -- OK,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
it's not going up any time really soon.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
But I'm not engaged in doing that.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
I actually get phone calls from people

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
I don't have a clue.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.330
and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
math has come into the picture.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
we need to look at this in a rigorous way.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Now, what is game theory about?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.330
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
That doesn't seem terribly shocking --

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
although it's controversial for a lot of people --

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
that we are self-interested.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
In order to look out for what's best for them

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
or what they think is best for them,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And they have beliefs about what other people want,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and what other people don't want, how much power other people have,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And they face limitations, constraints,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
they may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
they may be Einstein, stuck away farming

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
a great mathematician but nobody noticed.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Now who is rational?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
You know, what if people are rational?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Mother Theresa, she was rational.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Terrorists, they're rational.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
Pretty much everybody is rational.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of --

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
two-year-olds, they are not rational,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
they have very fickle preferences,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
they switch what they think all the time,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and schizophrenics are probably not rational,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
but pretty much everybody else is rational.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
That is, they are just trying to do

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
what they think is in their own best interest.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Now in order to work out what people are going to do

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
to pursue their interests,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
we have to think about who has influence in the world.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.330
If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
with regard to producing pollutants,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
one approach, the common approach,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
is to exhort them to be better,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
But if you show them that it's in their interest,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
then they're responsive.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
So, we have to work out who influences problems.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
we would like to think, may have some influence --

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
certainly the president in Iran has some influence --

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
but we make a mistake if we just pay attention

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
to the person at the top of the power ladder

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
because that person doesn't know much about Iran,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
or about energy policy,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
or about health care,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
or about any particular policy.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.330
That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
If we're talking about national security problems,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
maybe it's the Secretary of State,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
maybe it's the Secretary of Defense,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
the Director of National Intelligence,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
who they think is going to know more about the particular problem.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
Each of those people in turn

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
has advisers who advise them,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
so they can advise the president.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
There are lots of people shaping decisions

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
and so if we want to predict correctly

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
we have to pay attention to everybody

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
who is trying to shape the outcome,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
not just the people at the pinnacle

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
of the decision-making pyramid.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
There's a good reason that we don't do that,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
we can overcome the limitation

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
of just looking at a few people.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.330
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Imagine for example

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
that Sally over here,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
wants to know what Harry, and Jane,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
and George and Frank are thinking,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
and sends messages to those people.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Sally's giving her opinion to them,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and they're giving their opinion to Sally.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
But Sally also wants to know

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
what Harry is saying to these three,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
and what they're saying to Harry.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
And Harry wants to know

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
what each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
That's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
With five decision-makers

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
there are a lot of linkages --

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
120, as a matter of fact,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
if you remember your factorials.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Five factorial is 120.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Now you may be surprised to know

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
that smart people can keep 120 things straight

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
in their head.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Suppose we double the number of influencers

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
from five to 10.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.330
Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
we need to know, from 120 to 240?

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
No. How about 10 times?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
To 1,200? No.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
We've increased it to 3.6 million.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Nobody can keep that straight in their head.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
But computers,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
they can. They don't need coffee breaks,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
they don't need vacations,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
they don't need to go to sleep at night,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
they don't ask for raises either.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
They can keep this information straight

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
and that means that we can process the information.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
and you're going to be wondering,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
"Why should we listen to this guy?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
Why should we believe what he's saying?"

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
So I'm going to show you a factoid.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
of the percentage of time

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
that the model I'm talking about

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
when the experts who provided the data inputs

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
got it wrong.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
That's not my claim, that's a CIA claim -- you can read it,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
H. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
So, what do we need to know

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
in order to predict?

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
We do need to know who has a stake

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
We need to know what they say they want,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
not what they want in their heart of hearts,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
not what they think they can get,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
and we can work backwards from that

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.330
to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
We need to know how focused they are

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
on the problem at hand.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
That is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate --

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
how big a deal is it to them?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
And how much clout could they bring to bear

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.330
if they chose to engage on the issue?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
If we know those things

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.330
cares about two things on any decision.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
what they are interested in as possible.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit --

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
there's ego involvement,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.330
or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Different people trade off

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
between standing by their outcome,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
faithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
or giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
Most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
we can work out how to negotiate with them

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
to change their behavior.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
So with just that little bit of input

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
we can work out what the choices are that people have,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
what the chances are that they're willing to take,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
what they're after, what they value, what they want,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
and what they believe about other people.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
You might notice what we don't need to know:

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
there's no history in here.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
How they got to where they are

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
may be important in shaping the input information,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
but once we know where they are

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.330
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
So where are we going to get this information?

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
We can get this information

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
from the Internet, from The Economist,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
The Financial Times, The New York Times,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
U.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
or we can get it from asking experts

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
who spend their lives studying places and problems,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
because those experts know this information.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
how much clout do they have,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
are they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Alright, lets turn to Iran.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
Let me make three important predictions --

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
you can check this out, time will tell.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:26.330
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
What's its future?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
And everybody's best friend,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.330
How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
You take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.330
I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
I've taken inputs on positions and so forth,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
run it through a computer model

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
that had simulated the dynamics of interaction,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
and these are the simulated dynamics,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
the predictions about the path of policy.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
So you can see here on the vertical axis,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
I haven't shown it all the way down to zero,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
so I've narrowed the scale.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
Up at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb."

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.330
At 130, we start somewhere above 130,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
so that you could build a bomb.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
That's where, according to my analyses,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
the Iranians were at the beginning of this year.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
And then the model makes predictions down the road.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.330
At 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
to show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
they would build a research quantity.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
It would achieve some national pride,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
but not go ahead and build a weapon.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.330
which is what they say is their objective.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
The yellow line shows us the most likely path.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.330
The yellow line includes an analysis

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.330
of 87 decision makers in Iran,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
and a vast number of outside influencers

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
various players in the United States, and Egypt,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
Japan, so on and so forth.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
The white line reproduces the analysis

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
if the international environment

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
just left Iran to make its own internal decisions,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
under its own domestic political pressures.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
That's not going to be happening,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
but you can see that the line comes down faster

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
if they're not put under international pressure,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
if they're allowed to pursue their own devices.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
But in any event, by the end of this year,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.330
And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
and that a lot of others can live with.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.330
by making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.330
but not enough to actually build a bomb.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
How is this happening?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Over here you can see this is the distribution

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.330
of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
this is what that power block is predicted to be like

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.330
by the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
but by 2011 that gets to be a big block,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.330
and you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
Out here today, there are a bunch of people --

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
Ahmadinejad for example --

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
who would like not only to build a bomb,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
but test a bomb.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
That power disappears completely;

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
nobody supports that by 2011.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
These guys are all shrinking,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
the power is all drifting out here,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
and by the way, this was done a while ago

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
before the current economic crisis,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
and that's probably going to get steeper.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
the bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
They are growing in political clout,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
as the mullahs are isolating themselves --

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
with the exception of one group of mullahs,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
who are not well known to Americans.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
That's this line here, growing in power,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.330
these are what the Iranians call the quietists.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
who have great clout in the religious community,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
a direction contrary

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
to what Khomeini had in mind.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
Two things to notice: he's getting weaker,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
he is not a major player in Iran.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
He is on the way down.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.330
OK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
Everything is not predictable: the stock market

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
is, at least for me, not predictable,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.330
but most complicated negotiations are predictable.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.330
Again, whether we're talking health policy, education,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
environment, energy,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
litigation, mergers,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
all of these are complicated problems

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
that are predictable,

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.330
that this sort of technology can be applied to.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.330
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
but because if you can predict what people will do,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.330
you can engineer what they will do.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.330
And if you engineer what they do you can change the world,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.330
you can get a better result.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.330
I would like to leave you with one thought, which is

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.330
for me, the dominant theme of this gathering,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
When people say to you,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
"That's impossible,"

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.330
you say back to them,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
"When you say 'That's impossible,'

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
you're confused with,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.330
'I don't know how to do it.'"

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
Thank you.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.330
(Applause)

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
Chris Anderson: One question for you.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
That was fascinating.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
I love that you put it out there.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.330
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.330
putting this prediction out there might change the result.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.330
We've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
they've also pondered that.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330
It would be a good thing if

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
people paid more attention, took seriously,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
and engaged in the same sorts of calculations,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.330
because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:11.330
It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.330
and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.330
And, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.330
without having to manipulate them so much --

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.330
which is basically what I do, I manipulate them.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
So it would be a good thing.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.330
CA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:36.330
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330
and we could get there a lot sooner,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.330
and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:47.330
and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.330
and the world would be a better place.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.330
CA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.330
BBM: Thank you.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.330
(Applause)
