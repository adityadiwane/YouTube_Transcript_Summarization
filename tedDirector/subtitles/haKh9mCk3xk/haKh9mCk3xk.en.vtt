00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I hope you'll understand my English.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
(Laughter)

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.330
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.330
saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.330
And more and more, I'm convinced that

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
it's not only a solution for a country,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.330
but it's a solution for the problem of climate change.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.330
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
I'm working in cities for almost 40 years,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.330
or the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
I would like to say

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
from the experience I had: every city in the world

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.330
can be improved in less than three years.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
it's not a question of financial resources.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
and also a design.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.330
So to start, I want to introduce some characters

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
from a book I made for teenagers.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.330
The best example of quality of life is the turtle

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.330
because the turtle is an example of living and working together.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
looks like an urban tessitura,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.330
and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
And that's what we're doing in our cities:

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
living here, working here, having leisure here.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And most of the people are leaving the city

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and living outside of the city.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.330
So, the other character is Otto, the automobile.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.330
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and he drinks a lot. (Laughter)

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
he carries only one or two people

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.330
and he asks always for more infrastructure.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
Freeways.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
He's a very demanding person.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
he carries 300 people --

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:39.330
275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Speaking about the design: every city has its own design.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Curitiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.330
1,800,000 people in the city itself.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy:

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.330
And every city has its own design.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
But to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
and to propose a design --

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
an idea that everyone, or the large majority,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
will help you to make it happen.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And it's an example of living and working together.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And this is where we have more density;

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
it's where we have more public transport.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.330
So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
And it took 25 years until another city ...

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.330
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.330
And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.330
And one thing: it's important not for only your own city;

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
every city, besides its normal problems,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
they have a very important role

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
in being with the whole humanity.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.330
That means mostly two main issues --

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.330
mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
And this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
And we are very close to my house.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.330
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
And that's the evolution of the system.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.330
What in the design that made the difference

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
is the boarding tubes:

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.330
the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.330
That's why, I'm trying to say,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
it's like metro-nizing the bus.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.330
This is the design of the bus,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.330
And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
What I'm trying to say is

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.330
the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.330
more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars, it's ...

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.330
-- that's why when we're talking about sustainability,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
it's not enough, green buildings.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
It's not enough, a new materials.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
It's not enough, new sources of energy.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
It's the concept of the city, the design of the city,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:09.330
that's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.330
I'll speak on this later on.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
Our idea of mobility is trying

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
to make the connections between all the systems.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.330
We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
how to connect the subway with the bus.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
The subway was against, of course.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.330
And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.330
And you can understand how different it's going to be,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
the image of Rio with the system --

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
one-minute frequency.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
And it's not Shanghai,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.330
it's not being colored during the day, only at night

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
it will look this way.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.330
And before you say it's a Norman Foster design,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
we designed this in '83.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
And this is the model,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.330
how it's going to work. So, it's the same system;

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:20.330
the vehicle is different. And that's the model.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
What I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:29.330
to prove which system of transport is better.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
I'm trying to say we have to combine

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.330
all the systems, and with one condition:

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
if you have any kind of system --

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.330
never compete in the same space.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:58.330
And coming back to the car, I always used to say

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.330
that the car is like your mother-in-law:

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
you have to have good relationship with her,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
but she cannot command your life.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:21.330
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.330
you have a problem. (Laughter)

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:32.330
So, all the ideas about how to transform through design --

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:39.330
old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:47.330
all of it's related to how we teach the children.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.330
And after, the children teach their parents.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
And now we have 70 percent --

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:05.330
since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
Seven zero.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.330
(Applause)

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
So teach the children.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:21.330
I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
we have to work with everything what's said,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.330
but don't forget the cities and the children.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.330
because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
You should have always

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
a structure of living and working together.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Try to understand the sectors in the city

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:55.330
that could play different roles during the 24 hours.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
Another issue is, a city's like our family portrait.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
We don't rip our family portrait,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.330
even if we don't like the nose of our uncle,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
because this portrait is you.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:16.330
And these are the references that we have in any city.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
This is the main pedestrian mall;

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.330
we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:30.330
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
This is the Italian portal,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:39.330
the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.330
All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
And since we have people from

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
we have to stop the program.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
(Laughter)

00:11:53.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Don't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
If you cut two zeros, it's much better.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:14.330
And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.330
Quarries once made the nature, and

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
sometimes we took this and we transformed.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.330
And every part can be transformed;

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:38.330
every frog can be transformed in a prince.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.330
So, in a city, you have to work fast.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:48.330
Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:56.330
That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And this is an acupuncture note --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:06.330
or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
can make the city better.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.330
The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
32 meters.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
So, I want just to end saying

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:27.330
that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
but keep in mind that we have to work fast

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:41.330
to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:47.330
And I think creativity, innovation is starting.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.330
And we cannot have all the answers.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
So when you start --

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.330
and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.330
it's important starting and having the contribution from people,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
and they could teach you

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
if you're not in the right track.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:19.330
At the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
OK?

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
Please, allow me just two minutes.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:31.330
You're going to make the music and the rhythm.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
♫ Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! ♫

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
