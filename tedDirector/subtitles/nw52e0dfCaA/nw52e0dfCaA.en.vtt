00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Today I'm going to talk

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about unexpected discoveries.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Now I work in the solar technology industry.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And my small startup

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
is looking to force ourselves

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
into the environment

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
by paying attention to ...

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's just a quick video

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
of what we do.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Huh. Hang on a moment.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It might take a moment to load.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
(Laughter)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.260
We'll just -- we can just skip --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I'll just skip through the video instead ...

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.260
(Laughter)

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
No.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:27.260
(Laughter)

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
(Laughter)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.260
(Music)

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
This is not ...

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Laughter)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Okay.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
(Laughter)

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Solar technology is ...

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Oh, that's all my time?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:43.260
(Applause)
