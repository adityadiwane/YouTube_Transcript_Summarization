00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.374
For the next 16 minutes,
I'm going to take you on a journey

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:18.484
that is probably
the biggest dream of humanity:

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.523
to understand the code of life.

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.815
So for me, everything started
many, many years ago

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.562
when I met the first 3D printer.

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:28.260
The concept was fascinating.

00:00:28.284 --> 00:00:30.306
A 3D printer needs three elements:

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.464
a bit of information, some
raw material, some energy,

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:37.822
and it can produce any object
that was not there before.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:40.654
I was doing physics,
I was coming back home

00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:44.116
and I realized that I actually
always knew a 3D printer.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.476
And everyone does.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.658
It was my mom.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:47.683
(Laughter)

00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:50.121
My mom takes three elements:

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:54.118
a bit of information, which is between
my father and my mom in this case,

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:58.299
raw elements and energy
in the same media, that is food,

00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:00.831
and after several months, produces me.

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.667
And I was not existent before.

00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:06.453
So apart from the shock of my mom
discovering that she was a 3D printer,

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:11.215
I immediately got mesmerized
by that piece,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:12.956
the first one, the information.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.231
What amount of information does it take

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:17.191
to build and assemble a human?

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:18.789
Is it much? Is it little?

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.993
How many thumb drives can you fill?

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:23.641
Well, I was studying physics
at the beginning

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:29.262
and I took this approximation of a human
as a gigantic Lego piece.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:33.071
So, imagine that the building
blocks are little atoms

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:37.748
and there is a hydrogen here,
a carbon here, a nitrogen here.

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:39.343
So in the first approximation,

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:43.710
if I can list the number of atoms
that compose a human being,

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:45.121
I can build it.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:47.174
Now, you can run some numbers

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:50.475
and that happens to be
quite an astonishing number.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.256
So the number of atoms,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.035
the file that I will save in my thumb
drive to assemble a little baby,

00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:02.726
will actually fill an entire Titanic
of thumb drives --

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.468
multiplied 2,000 times.

00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:09.358
This is the miracle of life.

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.994
Every time you see from now on
a pregnant lady,

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.874
she's assembling the biggest
amount of information

00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:16.454
that you will ever encounter.

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:19.428
Forget big data, forget
anything you heard of.

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.333
This is the biggest amount
of information that exists.

00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:26.190
(Applause)

00:02:26.214 --> 00:02:30.858
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter
than a young physicist,

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:34.458
and in four billion years, managed
to pack this information

00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:37.187
in a small crystal we call DNA.

00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:41.917
We met it for the first time in 1950
when Rosalind Franklin,

00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.497
an amazing scientist, a woman,

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:44.910
took a picture of it.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:50.122
But it took us more than 40 years
to finally poke inside a human cell,

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.748
take out this crystal,

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:54.852
unroll it, and read it for the first time.

00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:58.856
The code comes out to be
a fairly simple alphabet,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.652
four letters: A, T, C and G.

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:06.166
And to build a human,
you need three billion of them.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.112
Three billion.

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:09.715
How many are three billion?

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.501
It doesn't really make
any sense as a number, right?

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:16.610
So I was thinking how
I could explain myself better

00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:19.684
about how big and enormous this code is.

00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:22.762
But there is -- I mean,
I'm going to have some help,

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.013
and the best person to help me
introduce the code

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:29.559
is actually the first man
to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:32.973
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:39.928
(Applause)

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:42.208
Not the man in the flesh,

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.793
but for the first time in history,

00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:49.279
this is the genome of a specific human,

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:53.063
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:57.083
262,000 pages of information,

00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:01.471
450 kilograms, shipped
from the United States to Canada

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:06.338
thanks to Bruno Bowden,
Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:07.825
It was an amazing feat.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.146
But this is the visual perception
of what is the code of life.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.648
And now, for the first time,
I can do something fun.

00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:17.219
I can actually poke inside it and read.

00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:21.868
So let me take an interesting
book ... like this one.

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.611
I have an annotation;
it's a fairly big book.

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:31.362
So just to let you see
what is the code of life.

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:35.957
Thousands and thousands and thousands

00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:38.651
and millions of letters.

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.071
And they apparently make sense.

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:42.852
Let's get to a specific part.

00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:44.933
Let me read it to you:

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:45.978
(Laughter)

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.008
"AAG, AAT, ATA."

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.032
To you it sounds like mute letters,

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:57.097
but this sequence gives
the color of the eyes to Craig.

00:04:57.633 --> 00:04:59.565
I'll show you another part of the book.

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:01.683
This is actually a little
more complicated.

00:05:02.983 --> 00:05:05.630
Chromosome 14, book 132:

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:07.744
(Laughter)

00:05:07.768 --> 00:05:09.045
As you might expect.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.535
(Laughter)

00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:19.364
"ATT, CTT, GATT."

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:22.016
This human is lucky,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.557
because if you miss just
two letters in this position --

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.458
two letters of our three billion --

00:05:28.482 --> 00:05:30.501
he will be condemned
to a terrible disease:

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:31.965
cystic fibrosis.

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:35.402
We have no cure for it,
we don't know how to solve it,

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:39.181
and it's just two letters
of difference from what we are.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:42.290
A wonderful book, a mighty book,

00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:45.113
a mighty book that helped me understand

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.890
and show you something quite remarkable.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.915
Every one of you -- what makes
me, me and you, you --

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.893
is just about five million of these,

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:57.145
half a book.

00:05:58.015 --> 00:05:59.678
For the rest,

00:05:59.702 --> 00:06:02.264
we are all absolutely identical.

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:07.026
Five hundred pages
is the miracle of life that you are.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.581
The rest, we all share it.

00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:12.514
So think about that again
when we think that we are different.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.759
This is the amount that we share.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.870
So now that I have your attention,

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:20.253
the next question is:

00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:21.428
How do I read it?

00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:22.961
How do I make sense out of it?

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.649
Well, for however good you can be
at assembling Swedish furniture,

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:31.236
this instruction manual
is nothing you can crack in your life.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.863
(Laughter)

00:06:32.887 --> 00:06:35.999
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,

00:06:36.023 --> 00:06:38.563
Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,

00:06:38.587 --> 00:06:40.514
decided to assemble a new company.

00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:41.950
Human Longevity was born,

00:06:41.974 --> 00:06:43.344
with one mission:

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:45.229
trying everything we can try

00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:48.012
and learning everything
we can learn from these books,

00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:49.741
with one target --

00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:53.663
making real the dream
of personalized medicine,

00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:57.454
understanding what things
should be done to have better health

00:06:57.478 --> 00:06:59.761
and what are the secrets in these books.

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:04.579
An amazing team, 40 data scientists
and many, many more people,

00:07:04.603 --> 00:07:05.953
a pleasure to work with.

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:08.230
The concept is actually very simple.

00:07:08.254 --> 00:07:11.412
We're going to use a technology
called machine learning.

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:15.975
On one side, we have genomes --
thousands of them.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.996
On the other side, we collected
the biggest database of human beings:

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.316
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --
everything you can think of.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.239
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:29.705
there is the secret of translation.

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.201
And in the middle, we build a machine.

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.186
We build a machine
and we train a machine --

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.420
well, not exactly one machine,
many, many machines --

00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:42.988
to try to understand and translate
the genome in a phenotype.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.702
What are those letters,
and what do they do?

00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:49.473
It's an approach that can
be used for everything,

00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:52.490
but using it in genomics
is particularly complicated.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.790
Little by little we grew and we wanted
to build different challenges.

00:07:55.814 --> 00:07:58.546
We started from the beginning,
from common traits.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.173
Common traits are comfortable
because they are common,

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:02.381
everyone has them.

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:04.899
So we started to ask our questions:

00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:06.303
Can we predict height?

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:09.162
Can we read the books
and predict your height?

00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:10.337
Well, we actually can,

00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:12.154
with five centimeters of precision.

00:08:12.178 --> 00:08:15.313
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,

00:08:15.337 --> 00:08:19.201
but we still can, we get in the ballpark,
eight kilograms of precision.

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:20.456
Can we predict eye color?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.638
Yeah, we can.

00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:22.986
Eighty percent accuracy.

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:25.324
Can we predict skin color?

00:08:25.348 --> 00:08:27.789
Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:29.153
Can we predict age?

00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:33.860
We can, because apparently,
the code changes during your life.

00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:37.166
It gets shorter, you lose pieces,
it gets insertions.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.745
We read the signals, and we make a model.

00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:41.913
Now, an interesting challenge:

00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:43.666
Can we predict a human face?

00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:46.292
It's a little complicated,

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:49.507
because a human face is scattered
among millions of these letters.

00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:52.160
And a human face is not
a very well-defined object.

00:08:52.184 --> 00:08:54.235
So, we had to build an entire tier of it

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:56.969
to learn and teach
a machine what a face is,

00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:59.030
and embed and compress it.

00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:01.302
And if you're comfortable
with machine learning,

00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:03.610
you understand what the challenge is here.

00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:10.099
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after
we read the first sequence --

00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:13.025
this October, we started
to see some signals.

00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:15.504
And it was a very emotional moment.

00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:19.273
What you see here is a subject
coming in our lab.

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:21.547
This is a face for us.

00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.202
So we take the real face of a subject,
we reduce the complexity,

00:09:25.226 --> 00:09:27.196
because not everything is in your face --

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.006
lots of features and defects
and asymmetries come from your life.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.499
We symmetrize the face,
and we run our algorithm.

00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:37.143
The results that I show you right now,

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:40.539
this is the prediction we have
from the blood.

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:43.120
(Applause)

00:09:43.144 --> 00:09:44.579
Wait a second.

00:09:44.603 --> 00:09:49.295
In these seconds, your eyes are watching,
left and right, left and right,

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:53.249
and your brain wants
those pictures to be identical.

00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:55.719
So I ask you to do
another exercise, to be honest.

00:09:55.743 --> 00:09:58.030
Please search for the differences,

00:09:58.054 --> 00:09:59.415
which are many.

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:02.042
The biggest amount of signal
comes from gender,

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:07.267
then there is age, BMI,
the ethnicity component of a human.

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:11.002
And scaling up over that signal
is much more complicated.

00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:14.276
But what you see here,
even in the differences,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.895
lets you understand
that we are in the right ballpark,

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.267
that we are getting closer.

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.640
And it's already giving you some emotions.

00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:24.367
This is another subject
that comes in place,

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.800
and this is a prediction.

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:30.420
A little smaller face, we didn't get
the complete cranial structure,

00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:33.095
but still, it's in the ballpark.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.858
This is a subject that comes in our lab,

00:10:35.882 --> 00:10:37.325
and this is the prediction.

00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:42.732
So these people have never been seen
in the training of the machine.

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:45.593
These are the so-called "held-out" set.

00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:49.357
But these are people that you will
probably never believe.

00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:52.057
We're publishing everything
in a scientific publication,

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.232
you can read it.

00:10:53.256 --> 00:10:55.600
But since we are onstage,
Chris challenged me.

00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:59.250
I probably exposed myself
and tried to predict

00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:02.105
someone that you might recognize.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.895
So, in this vial of blood --
and believe me, you have no idea

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:09.799
what we had to do to have
this blood now, here --

00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:13.724
in this vial of blood is the amount
of biological information

00:11:13.748 --> 00:11:16.025
that we need to do a full genome sequence.

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:18.119
We just need this amount.

00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:21.733
We ran this sequence,
and I'm going to do it with you.

00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:25.736
And we start to layer up
all the understanding we have.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.110
In the vial of blood,
we predicted he's a male.

00:11:29.134 --> 00:11:30.498
And the subject is a male.

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:33.434
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.850
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.

00:11:35.874 --> 00:11:39.984
So, we predicted that he's 76;
the subject is 82.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.333
We predict his age, 38.

00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:45.261
The subject is 35.

00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:47.975
We predict his eye color.

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:50.035
Too dark.

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:51.614
We predict his skin color.

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.436
We are almost there.

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:55.272
That's his face.

00:11:57.172 --> 00:12:00.441
Now, the reveal moment:

00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:02.235
the subject is this person.

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:04.194
(Laughter)

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.276
And I did it intentionally.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.992
I am a very particular
and peculiar ethnicity.

00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:12.966
Southern European, Italians --
they never fit in models.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:18.120
And it's particular -- that ethnicity
is a complex corner case for our model.

00:12:18.144 --> 00:12:19.653
But there is another point.

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:23.154
So, one of the things that we use
a lot to recognize people

00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:24.900
will never be written in the genome.

00:12:24.924 --> 00:12:27.241
It's our free will, it's how I look.

00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:30.494
Not my haircut in this case,
but my beard cut.

00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:34.071
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,
in this case, transfer it --

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:36.860
and this is nothing more
than Photoshop, no modeling --

00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.597
the beard on the subject.

00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:42.093
And immediately, we get
much, much better in the feeling.

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:45.664
So, why do we do this?

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:53.078
We certainly don't do it
for predicting height

00:12:53.102 --> 00:12:55.474
or taking a beautiful picture
out of your blood.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.408
We do it because the same technology
and the same approach,

00:13:00.432 --> 00:13:02.952
the machine learning of this code,

00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:06.113
is helping us to understand how we work,

00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:07.623
how your body works,

00:13:07.647 --> 00:13:09.312
how your body ages,

00:13:09.336 --> 00:13:12.105
how disease generates in your body,

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:15.101
how your cancer grows and develops,

00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:16.908
how drugs work

00:13:16.932 --> 00:13:19.246
and if they work on your body.

00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:21.380
This is a huge challenge.

00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:23.532
This is a challenge that we share

00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:26.135
with thousands of other
researchers around the world.

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:28.381
It's called personalized medicine.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:32.585
It's the ability to move
from a statistical approach

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:34.641
where you're a dot in the ocean,

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:36.478
to a personalized approach,

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:38.687
where we read all these books

00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:41.575
and we get an understanding
of exactly how you are.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.622
But it is a particularly
complicated challenge,

00:13:45.646 --> 00:13:49.644
because of all these books, as of today,

00:13:49.668 --> 00:13:52.310
we just know probably two percent:

00:13:53.027 --> 00:13:56.680
four books of more than 175.

00:13:58.021 --> 00:14:01.227
And this is not the topic of my talk,

00:14:02.145 --> 00:14:04.743
because we will learn more.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:08.047
There are the best minds
in the world on this topic.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.882
The prediction will get better,

00:14:10.906 --> 00:14:13.159
the model will get more precise.

00:14:13.183 --> 00:14:15.041
And the more we learn,

00:14:15.065 --> 00:14:19.895
the more we will
be confronted with decisions

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:22.940
that we never had to face before

00:14:22.964 --> 00:14:24.399
about life,

00:14:24.423 --> 00:14:26.097
about death,

00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:27.724
about parenting.

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:37.372
So, we are touching the very
inner detail on how life works.

00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:41.276
And it's a revolution
that cannot be confined

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.959
in the domain of science or technology.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.204
This must be a global conversation.

00:14:47.798 --> 00:14:53.015
We must start to think of the future
we're building as a humanity.

00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:57.103
We need to interact with creatives,
with artists, with philosophers,

00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:58.637
with politicians.

00:14:58.661 --> 00:14:59.819
Everyone is involved,

00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:02.668
because it's the future of our species.

00:15:03.273 --> 00:15:07.241
Without fear, but with the understanding

00:15:07.265 --> 00:15:11.136
that the decisions
that we make in the next year

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.949
will change the course of history forever.

00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:16.892
Thank you.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:27.075
(Applause)
