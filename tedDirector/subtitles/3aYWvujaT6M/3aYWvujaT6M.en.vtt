00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.416
I published this article

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.816
in the New York Times Modern Love column
in January of this year.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.176
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.496
And the article
is about a psychological study

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.936
designed to create romantic love
in the laboratory,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.696
and my own experience
trying the study myself

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.576
one night last summer.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.336
So the procedure is fairly simple:

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.216
two strangers take turns asking each other
36 increasingly personal questions

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.136
and then they stare into each other's eyes

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.720
without speaking for four minutes.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.736
So here are a couple of sample questions.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.016
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow
having gained any one quality or ability,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.240
what would it be?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.936
Number 28: When did you last cry
in front of another person?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.176
By yourself?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.456
As you can see, they really do
get more personal as they go along.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.856
Number 30, I really like this one:

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.736
Tell your partner
what you like about them;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.616
be very honest this time,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.000
saying things you might not say
to someone you just met.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.376
So when I first came across this study
a few years earlier,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.496
one detail really stuck out to me,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.576
and that was the rumor
that two of the participants

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.096
had gotten married six months later,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.296
and they'd invited the entire lab
to the ceremony.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.176
So I was of course very skeptical

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.856
about this process of just
manufacturing romantic love,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.736
but of course I was intrigued.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.176
And when I got the chance
to try this study myself,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.336
with someone I knew
but not particularly well,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.496
I wasn't expecting to fall in love.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.216
But then we did, and --

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.136
(Laughter)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.536
And I thought it made a good story,
so I sent it to the Modern Love column

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.376
a few months later.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120
Now, this was published in January,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.576
and now it is August,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.216
so I'm guessing that some of you
are probably wondering,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.616
are we still together?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.015
And the reason I think
you might be wondering this

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.696
is because I have been asked this question

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.656
again and again and again
for the past seven months.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.376
And this question is really
what I want to talk about today.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.856
But let's come back to it.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.856
(Laughter)

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.856
So the week before the article came out,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.576
I was very nervous.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.176
I had been working
on a book about love stories

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.016
for the past few years,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.856
so I had gotten used to writing
about my own experiences

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.896
with romantic love on my blog.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.496
But a blog post might get
a couple hundred views at the most,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.616
and those were usually
just my Facebook friends,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.216
and I figured my article
in the New York Times

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.040
would probably get a few thousand views.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.856
And that felt like a lot of attention

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.056
on a relatively new relationship.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.360
But as it turned out, I had no idea.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.136
So the article was published online

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.216
on a Friday evening,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.376
and by Saturday, this had happened
to the traffic on my blog.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.280
And by Sunday, both the Today Show
and Good Morning America had called.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.256
Within a month, the article
would receive over 8 million views,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.576
and I was, to say the least,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.496
underprepared for this sort of attention.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.496
It's one thing to work up
the confidence to write honestly

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.616
about your experiences with love,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.096
but it is another thing to discover

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.096
that your love life
has made international news --

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.336
(Laughter)

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.176
and to realize
that people across the world

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.176
are genuinely invested
in the status of your new relationship.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.376
(Laughter)

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.216
And when people called or emailed,
which they did every day for weeks,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.576
they always asked the same question first:

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.256
are you guys still together?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.616
In fact, as I was preparing this talk,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.896
I did a quick search of my email inbox

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.856
for the phrase "Are you still together?"

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.576
and several messages
popped up immediately.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.255
They were from students and journalists

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.296
and friendly strangers like this one.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.776
I did radio interviews and they asked.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.736
I even gave a talk, and one woman
shouted up to the stage,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.096
"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.416
And I promptly turned bright red.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.256
I understand that this
is part of the deal.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.816
If you write about your relationship
in an international newspaper,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.496
you should expect people
to feel comfortable asking about it.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.456
But I just wasn't prepared
for the scope of the response.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.336
The 36 questions seem
to have taken on a life of their own.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.776
In fact, the New York Times
published a follow-up article

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.016
for Valentine's Day,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.536
which featured readers' experiences
of trying the study themselves,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.840
with varying degrees of success.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.176
So my first impulse
in the face of all of this attention

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.640
was to become very protective
of my own relationship.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.936
I said no to every request
for the two of us

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.296
to do a media appearance together.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.016
I turned down TV interviews,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.176
and I said no to every request
for photos of the two us.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.776
I think I was afraid that we would become

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.936
inadvertent icons
for the process of falling in love,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.680
a position I did not at all
feel qualified for.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.216
And I get it:

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.016
people didn't just want to know
if the study worked,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.976
they wanted to know if it really worked:

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.696
that is, if it was capable
of producing love that would last,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.096
not just a fling, but real love,
sustainable love.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.216
But this was a question
I didn't feel capable of answering.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.936
My own relationship
was only a few months old,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.720
and I felt like people were asking
the wrong question in the first place.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.176
What would knowing whether or not
we were still together really tell them?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.856
If the answer was no,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.856
would it make the experience
of doing these 36 questions

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.080
any less worthwhile?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.576
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote
about these questions

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.976
in this study here in 1997,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.736
and here, the researcher's goal
was not to produce romantic love.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.696
Instead, they wanted to foster

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.176
interpersonal closeness
among college students,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.936
by using what Aron called

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.856
"sustained, escalating, reciprocal,
personalistic self-disclosure."

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.360
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.256
But the study did work.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.336
The participants
did feel closer after doing it,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.656
and several subsequent studies have also
used Aron's fast friends protocol

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.816
as a way to quickly create
trust and intimacy between strangers.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.269
They've used it between members
of the police and members of community,

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:22.853
and they've used it between people
of opposing political ideologies.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.576
The original version of the story,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.096
the one that I tried last summer,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.336
that pairs the personal questions
with four minutes of eye contact,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.456
was referenced in this article,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.080
but unfortunately it was never published.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.656
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.976
at a small liberal arts college,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.696
and a student came up to me afterwards

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.640
and he said, kind of shyly,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.376
"So, I tried your study,
and it didn't work."

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.656
He seemed a little mystified by this.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.456
"You mean, you didn't fall in love
with the person you did it with?" I asked.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.896
"Well..." He paused.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.400
"I think she just wants to be friends."

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.216
"But did you become
better friends?" I asked.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.896
"Did you feel like you got to really
know each other after doing the study?"

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.216
He nodded.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.176
"So, then it worked," I said.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.416
I don't think this is the answer
he was looking for.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.776
In fact, I don't think this is the answer
that any of us are looking for

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.056
when it comes to love.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.816
I first came across this study

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.296
when I was 29

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.736
and I was going through
a really difficult breakup.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.376
I had been in the relationship
since I was 20,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.176
which was basically my entire adult life,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.296
and he was my first real love,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.416
and I had no idea how or if
I could make a life without him.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.816
So I turned to science.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.416
I researched everything I could find
about the science of romantic love,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.536
and I think I was hoping that it might
somehow inoculate me from heartache.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.200
I don't know if I realized
this at the time --

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.416
I thought I was just doing research
for this book I was writing --

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.856
but it seems really obvious in retrospect.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.296
I hoped that if I armed myself
with the knowledge of romantic love,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.960
I might never have to feel
as terrible and lonely as I did then.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.616
And all this knowledge
has been useful in some ways.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.936
I am more patient with love.
I am more relaxed.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.536
I am more confident
about asking for what I want.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.296
But I can also see myself more clearly,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.576
and I can see that what I want
is sometimes more

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.656
than can reasonably be asked for.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.136
What I want from love is a guarantee,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.376
not just that I am loved today

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.816
and that I will be loved tomorrow,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.040
but that I will continue to be loved
by the person I love indefinitely.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.736
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.736
that people were really asking about

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.480
when they wanted to know
if we were still together.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.736
So the story that the media told
about the 36 questions

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.056
was that there might be
a shortcut to falling in love.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.816
There might be a way to somehow
mitigate some of the risk involved,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.456
and this is a very appealing story,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.656
because falling in love feels amazing,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.416
but it's also terrifying.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.016
The moment you admit to loving someone,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.680
you admit to having a lot to lose,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.856
and it's true that these questions
do provide a mechanism

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.176
for getting to know someone quickly,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.736
which is also a mechanism for being known,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.216
and I think this is the thing
that most of us really want from love:

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.320
to be known, to be seen, to be understood.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.136
But I think when it comes to love,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.656
we are too willing to accept
the short version of the story.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.256
The version of the story that asks,
"Are you still together?"

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.400
and is content with a yes or no answer.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.496
So rather than that question,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.176
I would propose we ask
some more difficult questions,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.400
questions like:

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.096
How do you decide who deserves your love

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.360
and who does not?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.096
How do you stay in love
when things get difficult,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.640
and how do you know
when to just cut and run?

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.776
How do you live with the doubt

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.816
that inevitably creeps
into every relationship,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.456
or even harder,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.840
how do you live with your partner's doubt?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.416
I don't necessarily know
the answers to these questions,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.576
but I think they're an important start
at having a more thoughtful conversation

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.760
about what it means to love someone.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.416
So, if you want it,

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.736
the short version of the story
of my relationship is this:

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.856
a year ago, an acquaintance
and I did a study

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.576
designed to create romantic love,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.296
and we fell in love,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.176
and we are still together,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.360
and I am so glad.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.800
But falling in love is not
the same thing as staying in love.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.840
Falling in love is the easy part.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.736
So at the end of my article, I wrote,
"Love didn't happen to us.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.056
We're in love because we each
made the choice to be."

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.256
And I cringe a little
when I read that now,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.576
not because it isn't true,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.816
but because at the time,
I really hadn't considered

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.456
everything that was contained
in that choice.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.696
I didn't consider how many times
we would each have to make that choice,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.296
and how many times I will continue
to have to make that choice

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.136
without knowing whether or not
he will always choose me.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.656
I want it to be enough to have asked
and answered 36 questions,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.896
and to have chosen to love someone
so generous and kind and fun

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.920
and to have broadcast that choice
in the biggest newspaper in America.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.976
But what I have done instead
is turn my relationship

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.176
into the kind of myth
I don't quite believe in.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.456
And what I want, what perhaps
I will spend my life wanting,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.176
is for that myth to be true.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.976
I want the happy ending
implied by the title to my article,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.496
which is, incidentally,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.176
the only part of the article
that I didn't actually write.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.496
(Laughter)

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.216
But what I have instead is the chance
to make the choice to love someone,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.696
and the hope that he will choose
to love me back,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.416
and it is terrifying,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.176
but that's the deal with love.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.440
Thank you.
