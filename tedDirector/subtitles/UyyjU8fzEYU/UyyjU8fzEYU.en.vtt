00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.374
I grew up to study the brain

00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:22.812
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.782
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:29.747
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:34.064
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:36.323
I can connect them to my reality,

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:39.013
and I can make my dreams come true?

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:42.814
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:48.306
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
so they instead become delusion?

00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:55.679
So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses.

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:59.306
And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.857
where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes,

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:05.148
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.

00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:08.306
And in the lab,
we were asking the question,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.180
"What are the biological differences

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:15.306
between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.000
as compared with the brains of individuals

00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:22.940
diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:27.455
So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.581
which cells are communicating
with which cells,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.139
with which chemicals,

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.512
and then in what quantities
of those chemicals?

00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:37.765
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.297
because I was performing
this type of research during the day,

00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.423
but then in the evenings
and on the weekends,

00:01:44.447 --> 00:01:50.010
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:53.306
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.306
I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own.

00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:02.230
A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.424
And in the course of four hours,

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:07.650
I watched my brain completely deteriorate

00:02:07.674 --> 00:02:11.258
in its ability to process all information.

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:13.037
On the morning of the hemorrhage,

00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:18.306
I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.306
If you've ever seen a human brain,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.175
it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.719
And I have brought for you
a real human brain.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.275
(Groaning, laughter)

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.775
So this is a real human brain.

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:48.306
This is the front of the brain,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.775
the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.226
and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.786
And when you look at the brain,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.819
it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices

00:03:00.843 --> 00:03:03.533
are completely separate from one another.

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.306
For those of you who understand computers,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.255
our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor,

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.009
while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.

00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:17.377
The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:18.956
through the corpus callosum,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.174
which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers.

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:24.306
But other than that,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.590
the two hemispheres
are completely separate.

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:31.306
Because they process
information differently,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.306
each of our hemispheres
think about different things,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.894
they care about different things,
and, dare I say,

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:40.333
they have very different personalities.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.092
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.416
Assistant: It has been.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.996
(Laughter)

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:56.361
Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment.

00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.306
It's all about "right here, right now."

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.306
Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.306
and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.306
Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.306
through all of our sensory systems

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.306
and then it explodes
into this enormous collage

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.306
of what this present moment looks like,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.306
what this present moment
smells like and tastes like,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.306
what it feels like
and what it sounds like.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.306
I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.853
through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere.

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:42.186
We are energy-beings
connected to one another

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.981
through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres

00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:47.330
as one human family.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:51.854
And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet,

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:55.306
here to make the world a better place.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.330
And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.306
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.468
Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically.

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:17.306
Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.306
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.922
that enormous collage
of the present moment

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:27.996
and start picking out details,
and more details about those details.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.413
It then categorizes and organizes
all that information,

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:35.948
associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned,

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:39.730
and projects into the future
all of our possibilities.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.306
And our left hemisphere
thinks in language.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.258
It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.306
to my external world.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.096
It's that little voice that says to me,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.908
"Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home.

00:05:57.932 --> 00:05:59.306
I need them in the morning."

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.228
It's that calculating intelligence

00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:05.071
that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry.

00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:09.924
But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me,

00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:13.779
"I am. I am."

00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:17.798
And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am,"

00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.436
I become separate.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.715
I become a single solid individual,

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.034
separate from the energy flow around me

00:06:24.058 --> 00:06:25.890
and separate from you.

00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:30.723
And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke.

00:06:30.747 --> 00:06:33.802
On the morning of the stroke,

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:38.125
I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye.

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.960
And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream.

00:06:42.984 --> 00:06:44.829
And it just gripped me --

00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:47.064
and then it released me.

00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:49.199
And then it just gripped me --

00:06:49.223 --> 00:06:50.950
and then it released me.

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:55.306
And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.902
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine."

00:06:57.926 --> 00:07:00.306
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.306
which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:06.755
And I'm jamming away on this thing,

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:11.548
and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:14.040
grasping onto the bar.

00:07:14.064 --> 00:07:16.055
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.535
And I looked down at my body

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:21.306
and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.996
And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.493
from my normal perception of reality,

00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:29.494
where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience,

00:07:29.518 --> 00:07:31.416
to some esoteric space

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.529
where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:38.550
And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse.

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:39.873
So I get off the machine,

00:07:39.897 --> 00:07:42.306
and I'm walking
across my living room floor,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.972
and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:50.432
And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate.

00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:53.305
There's no fluidity to my pace,

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:56.257
and there's this constriction
in my area of perception,

00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:59.306
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.861
And I'm standing in my bathroom

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.732
getting ready to step into the shower,

00:08:02.756 --> 00:08:05.505
and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body.

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:09.306
I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.718
You muscles, you relax."

00:08:10.742 --> 00:08:14.876
And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.845
And I look down at my arm

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:22.302
and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body.

00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:26.114
I can't define where I begin
and where I end,

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.306
because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.306
blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.306
And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.473
And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me?

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:40.276
What is going on?"

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.717
And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent.

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:50.013
Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button.

00:08:50.037 --> 00:08:51.306
Total silence.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.663
And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind.

00:08:56.687 --> 00:08:59.926
But then I was immediately captivated

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.710
by the magnificence
of the energy around me.

00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:07.608
And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body,

00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:11.170
I felt enormous and expansive.

00:09:11.194 --> 00:09:14.519
I felt at one with
all the energy that was,

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:16.709
and it was beautiful there.

00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:19.575
Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:21.806
and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem!

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.330
We've got to get some help."

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.382
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:26.933
(Laughter)

00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:28.948
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:33.471
But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness --

00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:37.330
and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land.

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:39.712
But it was beautiful there.

00:09:39.736 --> 00:09:42.734
Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected

00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:46.306
from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.172
So here I am in this space,

00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:52.306
and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.647
And I felt lighter in my body.

00:09:56.203 --> 00:09:59.306
And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.306
and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone.

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:05.504
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.965
And imagine
what it would feel like to lose

00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:12.727
37 years of emotional baggage!

00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:18.306
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.181
euphoria.

00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:21.306
It was beautiful.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.956
And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.606
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.028
We've got to get help."

00:10:27.052 --> 00:10:29.907
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus."

00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:32.399
So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.230
and I'm walking around my apartment,

00:10:34.254 --> 00:10:38.306
and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.599
And in that moment,

00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:41.965
my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side.

00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:46.306
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!"

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.949
And the next thing my brain says to me is,

00:10:48.973 --> 00:10:51.339
Wow! This is so cool!

00:10:51.363 --> 00:10:53.307
(Laughter)

00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:54.894
This is so cool!

00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:57.473
How many brain scientists
have the opportunity

00:10:57.497 --> 00:11:00.306
to study their own brain
from the inside out?"

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.306
(Laughter)

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.306
And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!"

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.480
(Laughter)

00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:09.671
"I don't have time for a stroke!"

00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.397
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening,

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:16.306
so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.782
So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work."

00:11:18.806 --> 00:11:20.706
I couldn't remember the number at work,

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.499
so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number.

00:11:24.523 --> 00:11:28.832
So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards.

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.513
And I'm looking at the card on top

00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:33.871
and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye

00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:35.606
what my business card looked like,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.218
I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not,

00:11:38.242 --> 00:11:40.108
because all I could see were pixels.

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:44.212
And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.544
and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell.

00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:50.708
And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity.

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:55.020
And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality

00:11:55.044 --> 00:11:59.194
and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card.

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:05.226
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.124
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,

00:12:07.148 --> 00:12:09.806
the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.830
I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone,

00:12:12.854 --> 00:12:14.406
but it's the only plan I have.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.115
So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here.

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:19.521
I take the business card,
I put it right here,

00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:23.306
and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.647
to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad.

00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:29.306
But then I would drift back out
into La La Land,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.306
and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.306
So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.306
and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.020
so that as I would come back
to normal reality,

00:12:44.044 --> 00:12:48.052
I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number."

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:52.416
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.077
and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me,

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.670
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:01.129
(Laughter)

00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:03.003
And I think to myself,

00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:06.066
"Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!"

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.717
(Laughter)

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:10.902
And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him:

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:12.568
"This is Jill! I need help!"

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:16.306
And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo."

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.140
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever."

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:21.085
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:24.735
that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:28.139
So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help.

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.051
And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance

00:13:32.075 --> 00:13:35.630
from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:38.820
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:46.209
And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air,

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.383
just right out of the balloon,

00:13:48.407 --> 00:13:53.645
I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender.

00:13:54.295 --> 00:14:00.306
And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.723
And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life,

00:14:04.747 --> 00:14:08.409
or this was perhaps
my moment of transition.

00:14:13.049 --> 00:14:15.256
When I woke later that afternoon,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.930
I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:25.306
When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.655
And my mind was now suspended

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:31.877
between two very opposite
planes of reality.

00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:35.188
Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems

00:14:35.212 --> 00:14:36.925
felt like pure pain.

00:14:37.488 --> 00:14:40.702
Light burned my brain like wildfire,

00:14:40.726 --> 00:14:44.321
and sounds were so loud and chaotic

00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:48.527
that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise,

00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:50.519
and I just wanted to escape.

00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:56.292
Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space,

00:14:56.316 --> 00:15:00.133
I felt enormous and expansive,

00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:03.728
like a genie just liberated
from her bottle.

00:15:04.982 --> 00:15:07.656
And my spirit soared free,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.330
like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria.

00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:16.569
Nirvana.

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:19.013
I found Nirvana.

00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:22.711
And I remember thinking,

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:27.165
there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.703
back inside this tiny little body.

00:15:32.147 --> 00:15:35.655
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:38.782
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.

00:15:38.806 --> 00:15:42.512
And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive,

00:15:42.536 --> 00:15:46.488
then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana."

00:15:48.758 --> 00:15:50.029
And I pictured a world

00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:56.013
filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people

00:15:56.037 --> 00:15:59.783
who knew that they could come
to this space at any time.

00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:03.980
And that they could purposely choose

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:06.797
to step to the right
of their left hemispheres --

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.306
and find this peace.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.553
And then I realized

00:16:11.577 --> 00:16:15.134
what a tremendous gift
this experience could be,

00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:21.053
what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives.

00:16:22.434 --> 00:16:24.957
And it motivated me to recover.

00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:32.409
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in,

00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:34.981
and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball

00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.996
that was pushing on my language centers.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.646
Here I am with my mama,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.575
who is a true angel in my life.

00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:45.749
It took me eight years
to completely recover.

00:16:46.996 --> 00:16:49.033
So who are we?

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:54.059
We are the life-force power
of the universe,

00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:58.380
with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds.

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:02.257
And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment,

00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:05.269
who and how we want to be in the world.

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:07.538
Right here, right now,

00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:12.788
I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are.

00:17:12.812 --> 00:17:15.869
I am the life-force power of the universe.

00:17:15.893 --> 00:17:17.433
I am the life-force power

00:17:17.457 --> 00:17:22.291
of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form,

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:24.591
at one with all that is.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:30.674
Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere,

00:17:30.698 --> 00:17:33.979
where I become
a single individual, a solid.

00:17:34.003 --> 00:17:37.562
Separate from the flow, separate from you.

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:39.696
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.549
intellectual, neuroanatomist.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:48.219
These are the "we" inside of me.

00:17:49.814 --> 00:17:51.314
Which would you choose?

00:17:53.853 --> 00:17:55.539
Which do you choose?

00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:58.467
And when?

00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:03.306
I believe that the more time we spend

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.307
choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry

00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:08.551
of our right hemispheres,

00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:11.881
the more peace we will project
into the world,

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:14.437
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:18.595
And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.406
Thank you.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.430
(Applause)
