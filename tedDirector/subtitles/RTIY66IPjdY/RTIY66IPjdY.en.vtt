00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
With all the legitimate concerns
about AIDS and avian flu --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.976
and we'll hear about that from the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.976
brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.334
I want to talk about the other
pandemic, which is

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:36.976
cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, hypertension --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.976
all of which are completely
preventable for at

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.976
least 95 percent of people

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.976
just by changing diet and lifestyle.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.976
And what's happening is that there's a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.239
globalization of illness
occurring, that people

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:48.976
are starting to eat like us,
and live like us, and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.976
die like us. And
in one generation, for example,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
Asia's gone from having
one of the lowest rates of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.143
heart disease and obesity
and diabetes to one

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.976
of the highest. And in Africa,
cardiovascular disease

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.976
equals the HIV and AIDS deaths

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.976
in most countries.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.976
So there's a critical
window of opportunity we

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.976
have to make an important
difference that can

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.976
affect the lives of literally
millions of people,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.096
and practice preventive
medicine on a global

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.976
scale.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.191
Heart and blood vessel
diseases still kill more

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:16.311
people -- not only in this
country, but also

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:18.976
worldwide -- than everything
else combined, and yet

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.334
it's completely preventable
for almost everybody.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.976
It's not only preventable; it's actually

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.143
reversible. And for the last
almost 29 years,

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.406
we've been able to show
that by simply changing

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.976
diet and lifestyle, using
these very high-tech,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.334
expensive, state-of-the-art
measures to prove how

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:35.976
powerful these very simple
and low-tech and low-cost

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
interventions can be like -- quantitative

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.048
arteriography,
before and after a year, and

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:40.976
cardiac PET scans.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.976
We showed a few months
ago -- we published the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.096
first study showing you
can actually stop or

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.263
reverse the progression
of prostate cancer by

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:49.976
making changes in diet
and lifestyle, and 70 percent

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.976
regression in the tumor
growth, or inhibition of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.976
the tumor growth, compared
to only nine percent in the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.976
control group.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.096
And in the MRI and MR
spectroscopy here, the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.096
prostate tumor activity
is shown in red -- you can

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.976
see it diminishing after a year.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.976
Now there is an epidemic
of obesity: two-thirds of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.976
adults and 15 percent of kids.
What's really concerning

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.976
to me is that diabetes has
increased 70 percent in the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.976
past 10 years, and this may be the first

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.976
generation in which our kids
live a shorter life

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.976
span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.976
preventable.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
Now these are not election
returns, these are the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.286
people -- the number
of the people who are obese

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.976
by state, beginning in '85,
'86, '87 -- these are

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.976
from the CDC website --
'88, '89, '90, '91 -- you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.976
get a new category --
'92, '93, '94, '95, '96,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.976
'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001
-- it gets worse. We're

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.381
kind of devolving. (Laughter)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.976
Now what can we do about this?
Well, you know, the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.976
diet that we've found
that can reverse heart

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
disease and cancer is an Asian diet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.976
But the people in Asia
are starting to eat like we

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.976
are, which is why they're
starting to get sick

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.976
like we are.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.976
So I've been working
with a lot of the big food

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.976
companies. They can make
it fun and sexy and hip

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.381
and crunchy and convenient
to eat healthier foods,

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:04.976
like -- I chair the advisory
boards to McDonald's,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.976
and PepsiCo, and ConAgra,
and Safeway, and soon

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.143
Del Monte, and they're
finding that it's good

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:09.976
business.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.976
The salads that you see
at McDonald's came from

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.976
the work -- they're going
to have an Asian salad. At

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.976
Pepsi, two-thirds
of their revenue growth came

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.976
from their better foods.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.143
And so if we can do that,
then we can free up

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.976
resources for buying drugs
that you really do need

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.976
for treating AIDS and HIV
and malaria and for

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.524
preventing avian flu. Thank you.
