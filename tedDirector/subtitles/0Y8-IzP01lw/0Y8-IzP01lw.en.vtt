00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:16.621
Science,

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.958
science has allowed us to know so much

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.984
about the far reaches of the universe,

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:26.179
which is at the same time tremendously important

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.245
and extremely remote,

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.704
and yet much, much closer,

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.795
much more directly related to us,

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.263
there are many things we don't really understand.

00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:37.392
And one of them is the extraordinary

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:40.718
social complexity of the animals around us,

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:42.734
and today I want to tell you a few stories

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.742
of animal complexity.

00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:48.092
But first, what do we call complexity?

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:49.579
What is complex?

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.006
Well, complex is not complicated.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.454
Something complicated comprises many small parts,

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.884
all different, and each of them

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.003
has its own precise role in the machinery.

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.814
On the opposite, a complex system

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.455
is made of many, many similar parts,

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:09.463
and it is their interaction

00:01:09.463 --> 00:01:12.783
that produces a globally coherent behavior.

00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:16.619
Complex systems have many interacting parts

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.045
which behave according to simple, individual rules,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:23.394
and this results in emergent properties.

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:25.282
The behavior of the system as a whole

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:26.950
cannot be predicted

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.102
from the individual rules only.

00:01:29.102 --> 00:01:30.912
As Aristotle wrote,

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:33.972
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:36.434
But from Aristotle, let's move onto

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:40.124
a more concrete example of complex systems.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:42.080
These are Scottish terriers.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.831
In the beginning, the system is disorganized.

00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.632
Then comes a perturbation: milk.

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:53.482
Every individual starts pushing in one direction

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:56.791
and this is what happens.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.617
The pinwheel is an emergent property

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:01.520
of the interactions between puppies

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.430
whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.037
and therefore to push in a random direction.

00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:13.012
So it's all about finding the simple rules

00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:15.770
from which complexity emerges.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.710
I call this simplifying complexity,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.845
and it's what we do at the chair of systems design

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.822
at ETH Zurich.

00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:26.527
We collect data on animal populations,

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:30.338
analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:32.957
It requires physicists who work with biologists,

00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:35.680
with mathematicians and computer scientists,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.500
and it is their interaction that produces

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.214
cross-boundary competence

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:41.792
to solve these problems.

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:44.064
So again, the whole is greater

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.464
than the sum of the parts.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.614
In a way, collaboration

00:02:47.614 --> 00:02:51.105
is another example of a complex system.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:52.981
And you may be asking yourself

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:55.798
which side I'm on, biology or physics?

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:57.909
In fact, it's a little different,

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.498
and to explain, I need to tell you

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:01.840
a short story about myself.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.567
When I was a child,

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:07.676
I loved to build stuff, to
create complicated machines.

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:10.413
So I set out to study electrical engineering

00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:11.965
and robotics,

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:14.058
and my end-of-studies project

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:16.984
was about building a robot called ER-1 --

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.914
it looked like thisâ€”

00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:21.285
that would collect information from its environment

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.783
and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:27.162
It was very, very complicated,

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:30.146
but it worked beautifully in our test room,

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.599
and on demo day, professors had 
assembled to grade the project.

00:03:33.607 --> 00:03:36.509
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.819
It turned out, the light in that room

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.638
was slightly different.

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.969
The robot's vision system got confused.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.730
At the first bend in the line,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.469
it left its course, and crashed into a wall.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.556
We had spent weeks building it,

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:52.229
and all it took to destroy it

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.885
was a subtle change in the color of the light

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:56.481
in the room.

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:57.996
That's when I realized that

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:00.323
the more complicated you make a machine,

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.362
the more likely that it will fail

00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:04.925
due to something absolutely unexpected.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:06.755
And I decided that, in fact,

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:09.768
I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:12.710
I wanted to understand complexity,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.698
the complexity of the world around us

00:04:14.698 --> 00:04:17.103
and especially in the animal kingdom.

00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:20.423
Which brings us to bats.

00:04:20.423 --> 00:04:23.474
Bechstein's bats are a common
species of European bats.

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:24.887
They are very social animals.

00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:28.178
Mostly they roost, or sleep, together.

00:04:28.178 --> 00:04:29.857
And they live in maternity colonies,

00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:31.397
which means that every spring,

00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:34.655
the females meet after the winter hibernation,

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:36.744
and they stay together for about six months

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:39.230
to rear their young,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.035
and they all carry a very small chip,

00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:43.906
which means that every time one of them

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:46.963
enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,

00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:48.606
we know where she is,

00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:49.775
and more importantly,

00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:52.338
we know with whom she is.

00:04:52.338 --> 00:04:56.032
So I study roosting associations in bats,

00:04:56.032 --> 00:04:58.477
and this is what it looks like.

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:00.919
During the day, the bats roost

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.223
in a number of sub-groups in different boxes.

00:05:03.223 --> 00:05:05.152
It could be that on one day,

00:05:05.152 --> 00:05:07.372
the colony is split between two boxes,

00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:08.672
but on another day,

00:05:08.672 --> 00:05:10.913
it could be together in a single box,

00:05:10.913 --> 00:05:13.229
or split between three or more boxes,

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.156
and that all seems rather erratic, really.

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:19.359
It's called fission-fusion dynamics,

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:21.072
the property for an animal group

00:05:21.072 --> 00:05:23.250
of regularly splitting and merging

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.911
into different subgroups.

00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.473
So what we do is take all these data

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:29.135
from all these different days

00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:30.639
and pool them together

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.256
to extract a long-term association pattern

00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:35.761
by applying techniques with network analysis

00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:37.382
to get a complete picture

00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:39.919
of the social structure of the colony.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.184
Okay? So that's what this picture looks like.

00:05:44.184 --> 00:05:46.578
In this network, all the circles

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:49.355
are nodes, individual bats,

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:50.938
and the lines between them

00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:54.602
are social bonds, associations between individuals.

00:05:54.602 --> 00:05:57.280
It turns out this is a very interesting picture.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.262
This bat colony is organized

00:05:59.262 --> 00:06:01.130
in two different communities

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.969
which cannot be predicted

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.218
from the daily fission-fusion dynamics.

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:08.768
We call them cryptic social units.

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.384
Even more interesting, in fact:

00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:12.748
Every year, around October,

00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:14.309
the colony splits up,

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.007
and all bats hibernate separately,

00:06:17.007 --> 00:06:18.468
but year after year,

00:06:18.468 --> 00:06:21.541
when the bats come together again in the spring,

00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:24.131
the communities stay the same.

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:26.851
So these bats remember their friends

00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:28.681
for a really long time.

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:31.155
With a brain the size of a peanut,

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:33.280
they maintain individualized,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.422
long-term social bonds,

00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:37.146
We didn't know that was possible.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.905
We knew that primates

00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:41.473
and elephants and dolphins could do that,

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:44.101
but compared to bats, they have huge brains.

00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:46.500
So how could it be

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.451
that the bats maintain this complex,

00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:50.139
stable social structure

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.671
with such limited cognitive abilities?

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:56.560
And this is where complexity brings an answer.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.701
To understand this system,

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.498
we built a computer model of roosting,

00:07:01.498 --> 00:07:03.516
based on simple, individual rules,

00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:05.951
and simulated thousands and thousands of days

00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:07.970
in the virtual bat colony.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.094
It's a mathematical model,

00:07:10.094 --> 00:07:12.048
but it's not complicated.

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.146
What the model told us is that, in a nutshell,

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:18.332
each bat knows a few other colony members

00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:20.820
as her friends, and is just slightly more likely

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.330
to roost in a box with them.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.774
Simple, individual rules.

00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:27.486
This is all it takes to explain

00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:29.875
the social complexity of these bats.

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:31.593
But it gets better.

00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:34.441
Between 2010 and 2011,

00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:37.894
the colony lost more than two thirds of its members,

00:07:37.894 --> 00:07:40.880
probably due to the very cold winter.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.024
The next spring, it didn't form two communities

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:45.295
like every year,

00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:47.498
which may have led the whole colony to die

00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:49.593
because it had become too small.

00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:54.966
Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:57.698
which allowed the colony to survive that season

00:07:57.698 --> 00:08:00.802
and thrive again in the next two years.

00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:02.580
What we know is that the bats

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.487
are not aware that their colony is doing this.

00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:09.033
All they do is follow simple association rules,

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:10.382
and from this simplicity

00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:12.823
emerges social complexity

00:08:12.823 --> 00:08:15.663
which allows the colony to be resilient

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:18.644
against dramatic changes
in the population structure.

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:21.338
And I find this incredible.

00:08:21.338 --> 00:08:23.422
Now I want to tell you another story,

00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:24.977
but for this we have to travel from Europe

00:08:24.977 --> 00:08:28.025
to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:30.052
This is where meerkats live.

00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:31.552
I'm sure you know meerkats.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.658
They're fascinating creatures.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.647
They live in groups with a
very strict social hierarchy.

00:08:36.647 --> 00:08:38.106
There is one dominant pair,

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:39.488
and many subordinates,

00:08:39.488 --> 00:08:41.202
some acting as sentinels,

00:08:41.202 --> 00:08:42.539
some acting as babysitters,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.436
some teaching pups, and so on.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.757
What we do is put very small GPS collars

00:08:47.757 --> 00:08:49.282
on these animals

00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:51.157
to study how they move together,

00:08:51.157 --> 00:08:54.874
and what this has to do with their social structure.

00:08:54.874 --> 00:08:56.364
And there's a very interesting example

00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:59.080
of collective movement in meerkats.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.447
In the middle of the reserve which they live in

00:09:01.447 --> 00:09:02.656
lies a road.

00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:05.889
On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:08.173
But the meerkats have to cross it

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.747
to get from one feeding place to another.

00:09:10.747 --> 00:09:15.498
So we asked, how exactly do they do this?

00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:17.334
We found that the dominant female

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:19.955
is mostly the one who leads the group to the road,

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:23.227
but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,

00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:25.578
she gives way to the subordinates,

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:27.355
a manner of saying,

00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:30.037
"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe."

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:31.701
What I didn't know, in fact,

00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:34.843
was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:37.768
for this change at the edge of the group to happen

00:09:37.768 --> 00:09:41.618
and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.

00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:45.609
So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:47.522
crossing a simulated road.

00:09:47.522 --> 00:09:49.394
It's a simplistic model.

00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:52.234
Moving meerkats are like random particles

00:09:52.234 --> 00:09:54.456
whose unique rule is one of alignment.

00:09:54.456 --> 00:09:56.862
They simply move together.

00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:00.046
When these particles get to the road,

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.988
they sense some kind of obstacle,

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:04.072
and they bounce against it.

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:05.228
The only difference

00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:07.270
between the dominant female, here in red,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.755
and the other individuals,

00:10:08.755 --> 00:10:11.309
is that for her, the height of the obstacle,

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:13.814
which is in fact the risk perceived from the road,

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.763
is just slightly higher,

00:10:15.763 --> 00:10:17.424
and this tiny difference

00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:19.262
in the individual's rule of movement

00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:21.708
is sufficient to explain what we observe,

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.268
that the dominant female

00:10:24.268 --> 00:10:25.702
leads her group to the road

00:10:25.702 --> 00:10:27.372
and then gives way to the others

00:10:27.372 --> 00:10:30.235
for them to cross first.

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:33.886
George Box, who was an English statistician,

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:36.848
once wrote, "All models are false,

00:10:36.848 --> 00:10:38.907
but some models are useful."

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:42.104
And in fact, this model is obviously false,

00:10:42.104 --> 00:10:46.072
because in reality, meerkats are
anything but random particles.

00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:47.709
But it's also useful,

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:50.458
because it tells us that extreme simplicity

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:53.816
in movement rules at the individual level

00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:56.167
can result in a great deal of complexity

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.105
at the level of the group.

00:10:58.105 --> 00:11:02.161
So again, that's simplifying complexity.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.609
I would like to conclude

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:06.426
on what this means for the whole species.

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:08.090
When the dominant female

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.656
gives way to a subordinate,

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:11.773
it's not out of courtesy.

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.280
In fact, the dominant female

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.799
is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:19.311
If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.547
So this behavior of risk avoidance

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.348
is a very old evolutionary response.

00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:28.217
These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic

00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:30.450
that is thousands of generations old,

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.864
and they're adapting it to a modern risk,

00:11:32.864 --> 00:11:36.189
in this case a road built by humans.

00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:38.584
They adapt very simple rules,

00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:40.873
and the resulting complex behavior

00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:43.829
allows them to resist human encroachment

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.277
into their natural habitat.

00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:48.079
In the end,

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:50.779
it may be bats which change their social structure

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:53.163
in response to a population crash,

00:11:53.163 --> 00:11:54.562
or it may be meerkats

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:57.764
who show a novel adaptation to a human road,

00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:00.449
or it may be another species.

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:03.242
My message here -- and it's not a complicated one,

00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:06.006
but a simple one of wonder and hope --

00:12:06.006 --> 00:12:09.099
my message here is that animals

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:11.523
show extraordinary social complexity,

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.964
and this allows them to adapt

00:12:13.964 --> 00:12:17.445
and respond to changes in their environment.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:20.213
In three words, in the animal kingdom,

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:22.987
simplicity leads to complexity

00:12:22.987 --> 00:12:24.470
which leads to resilience.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.754
Thank you.

00:12:26.754 --> 00:12:33.434
(Applause)

00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:44.647
Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:47.926
for this great start. Little bit nervous?

00:12:47.926 --> 00:12:49.570
Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.030
DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a 
lot of people in the audience

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.894
somehow tried to make associations

00:12:53.894 --> 00:12:55.718
between the animals you were talking about --

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.774
the bats, meerkats -- and humans.

00:12:57.774 --> 00:12:58.982
You brought some examples:

00:12:58.982 --> 00:13:00.717
The females are the social ones,

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:02.430
the females are the dominant ones,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.103
I'm not sure who thinks how.

00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:06.998
But is it okay to do these associations?

00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:09.798
Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard

00:13:09.798 --> 00:13:13.071
that can be valid across all species?

00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:14.674
NP: Well, I would say there are also

00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:16.626
counter-examples to these stereotypes.

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:19.766
For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:23.464
it is the males who take care of the young always.

00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:28.505
And the lesson is that it's often difficult,

00:13:28.505 --> 00:13:30.257
and sometimes even a bit dangerous,

00:13:30.257 --> 00:13:32.929
to draw parallels between humans and animals.

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:35.035
So that's it.

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:37.881
DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:39.961
Thank you, Nicolas Perony.
