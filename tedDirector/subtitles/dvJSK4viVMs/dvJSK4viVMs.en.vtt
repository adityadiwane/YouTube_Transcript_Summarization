00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.779
This is a story about capitalism.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.567
It's a system I love

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:23.291
because of the successes and opportunities
it's afforded me and millions of others.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:30.056
I started in my 20s trading commodities,
cotton in particular, in the pits,

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:33.682
and if there was ever a free market
free-for-all, this was it,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.300
where men wearing ties 
but acting like gladiators

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.787
fought literally 
and physically for a profit.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:44.360
Fortunately, I was good enough
that by the time I was 30,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.020
I was able to move into the upstairs 
world of money management,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.572
where I spent the next three decades
as a global macro trader.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.846
And over that time, I've seen
a lot of crazy things in the markets,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:59.529
and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.638
And unfortunately,

00:01:01.638 --> 00:01:04.938
I'm sad to report that right now 
we might be in the grips

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:08.894
of one of the most disastrous,
certainly of my career,

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.115
and one consistent takeaway is
manias never end well.

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:15.581
Now, over the past 50 years,

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:21.432
we as a society have come to view
our companies and corporations

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:26.238
in a very narrow, almost
monomaniacal fashion

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:30.255
with regard to how we value them,

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:33.924
and we have put
so much emphasis on profits,

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:36.710
on short-term quarterly
earnings and share prices,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.550
at the exclusion of all else.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.319
It's like we've ripped the humanity
out of our companies.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.313
Now, we don't do that --
conveniently reduce something

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:51.521
to a set of numbers that you
can play with like Lego toys --

00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:53.869
we don't do that in our individual life.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.072
We don't treat somebody or value them

00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:01.213
based on their monthly income 
or their credit score,

00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:03.020
but we have this double standard

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.565
when it comes to the way
that we value our businesses,

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.050
and you know what?

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.215
It's threatening the very
underpinnings of our society.

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:11.817
And here's how you'll see.

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:16.322
This chart is corporate profit margins
going back 40 years

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:18.400
as a percentage of revenues,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.707
and you can see that we're
at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:26.259
Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.526
but if you're the other side of that,
and you're the average American worker,

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:33.833
then you can see it's not
such a good thing.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:37.410
["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs.
CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.527
Now, higher profit margins
do not increase societal wealth.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:45.766
What they actually do is they
exacerbate income inequality,

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:48.166
and that's not a good thing.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.627
But intuitively, that makes sense, right?

00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:54.250
Because if the top 10 percent
of American families

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.610
own 90 percent of the stocks,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.571
as they take a greater share
of corporate profits,

00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:03.514
then there's less wealth left
for the rest of society.

00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:06.300
Again, income inequality
is not a good thing.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.761
This next chart,
made by The Equality Trust,

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:13.614
shows 21 countries from Austria
to Japan to New Zealand.

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:16.818
On the horizontal axis
is income inequality.

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:20.116
The further to the right you go,
the greater the income inequality.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.459
On the vertical axis
are nine social and health metrics.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.222
The more you go up that,
the worse the problems are,

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:31.470
and those metrics include life expectancy,
teenage pregnancy, literacy,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.210
social mobility, just to name a few.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.391
Now, those of you in the audience
who are Americans may wonder,

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.736
well, where does the United States rank?

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.593
Where does it lie on that chart?

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:43.288
And guess what?

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:45.370
We're literally off the chart.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.793
Yes, that's us,

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:49.952
with the greatest income inequality

00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:54.248
and the greatest social problems,
according to those metrics.

00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:56.802
Now, here's a macro forecast
that's easy to make,

00:03:56.802 --> 00:04:00.401
and that's, that gap between
the wealthiest and the poorest,

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.421
it will get closed.

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:04.010
History always does it.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.159
It typically happens in one of three ways:

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.560
either through revolution,
higher taxes, or wars.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.889
None of those are on my bucket list.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.025
(Laughter)

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:18.086
Now, there's another way to do it,

00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:22.226
and that's by increasing justness
in corporate behavior,

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:24.989
but the way that we're
operating right now,

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:28.983
that would require
a tremendous change in behavior,

00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:32.930
and like an addict trying to kick a habit,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.436
the first step is to acknowledge
that you have a problem.

00:04:36.436 --> 00:04:40.337
And let me just say,
this profits mania that we're on

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:42.636
is so deeply entrenched

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:45.167
that we don't even realize
how we're harming society.

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:49.184
Here's a small but startling example
of exactly how we're doing that:

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:52.247
this chart shows corporate giving

00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:57.632
as a percentage of profits, 
not revenues, over the last 30 years.

00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:03.401
Juxtapose that to the earlier chart
of corporate profit margins,

00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:07.528
and I ask you, does that feel right?

00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:11.699
In all fairness, when I
started writing this, I thought,

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.160
"Oh wow, what does my company,
what does Tudor do?"

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.693
And I realized we give one percent
of corporate profits

00:05:19.693 --> 00:05:21.423
to charity every year.

00:05:21.423 --> 00:05:25.324
And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:31.623
When I realized that, I literally
wanted to throw up.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.101
But the point is, this mania
is so deeply entrenched

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:39.263
that well-intentioned people like myself
don't even realize that we're part of it.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:42.274
Now, we're not going
to change corporate behavior

00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:47.591
by simply increasing corporate
philanthropy or charitable contributions.

00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:50.725
And oh, by the way,
we've since quadrupled that,

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:54.974
but -- (Applause) -- Please.

00:05:54.974 --> 00:05:58.713
But we can do it by driving
more just behavior.

00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:01.754
And one way to do it is actually trusting

00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:04.169
the system that got us
here in the first place,

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.282
and that's the free market system.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.975
About a year ago,
some friends of mine and I

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:12.025
started a not-for-profit
called Just Capital.

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:13.493
Its mission is very simple:

00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:15.988
to help companies and corporations

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:21.263
learn how to operate in a more just
fashion by using the public's input

00:06:21.263 --> 00:06:27.574
to define exactly what the criteria are
for just corporate behavior.

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:29.989
Now, right now, there's
no widely accepted standard

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:34.331
that a company or corporation can follow,
and that's where Just Capital comes in,

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:39.651
because beginning this year and every year
we'll be conducting a nationwide survey

00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.781
of a representative sample
of 20,000 Americans

00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:46.701
to find out exactly what they think

00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.579
are the criteria for justness
in corporate behavior.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:53.591
Now, this is a model that's going
to start in the United States

00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:56.226
but can be expanded
anywhere around the globe,

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:58.107
and maybe we'll find out

00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:00.975
that the most important
thing for the public

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:06.326
is that we create living wage jobs,
or make healthy products,

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:09.577
or help, not harm, the environment.

00:07:09.577 --> 00:07:13.850
At Just Capital, we don't know,
and it's not for us to decide.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.846
We're but messengers,

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:19.956
but we have 100 percent confidence 
and faith in the American public

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:21.190
to get it right.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.410
So we'll release the findings
this September for the first time,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.850
and then next year, we'll poll again,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.149
and we'll take the additive step this time

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.168
of ranking the 1,000
largest U.S. companies

00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:37.720
from number one to number 1,000
and everything in between.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.551
We're calling it the Just Index,

00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:45.800
and remember, we're an independent
not-for-profit with no bias,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.953
and we will be giving
the American public a voice.

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:55.156
And maybe over time, we'll find out
that as people come to know

00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:57.176
which companies are the most just,

00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:01.216
human and economic resources
will be driven towards them,

00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:03.190
and they'll become the most prosperous

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.021
and help our country
be the most prosperous.

00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:11.457
Now, capitalism has been responsible
for every major innovation

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:15.608
that's made this world a more inspiring
and wonderful place to live in.

00:08:16.578 --> 00:08:19.443
Capitalism has to be based on justice.

00:08:19.443 --> 00:08:21.649
It has to be, and now more than ever,

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:25.480
with economic divisions
growing wider every day.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.498
It's estimated that 47 percent
of American workers

00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:31.796
can be displaced in the next 20 years.

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.769
I'm not against progress.

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:38.650
I want the driverless car and the jet pack
just like everyone else.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:44.500
But I'm pleading for recognition
that with increased wealth and profits

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.930
has to come greater
corporate social responsibility.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.665
"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith,
the father of capitalism,

00:08:55.665 --> 00:09:01.419
"the great, the immense fabric
of human society must in a moment

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:05.626
crumble into atoms."

00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:09.390
Now, when I was young,
and there was a problem,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.573
my mama used to always
sigh and shake her head and say,

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:17.630
"Have mercy, have mercy."

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.181
Now's not the time for us,
for the rest of us to show them mercy.

00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:25.370
The time is now for us
to show them fairness,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.846
and we can do that, you and I,

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:33.100
by starting where we work,
in the businesses that we operate in.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.460
And when we put justness
on par with profits,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.408
we'll get the most wonderful thing
in all the world.

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:43.774
We'll take back our humanity.

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:46.421
Thank you.

00:09:46.421 --> 00:09:50.246
(Applause)
