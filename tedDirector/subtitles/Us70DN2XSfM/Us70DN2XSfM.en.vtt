00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.190
Growing up, I didn't always understand

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.885
why my parents made me
follow the rules that they did.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.675
Like, why did I really 
have to mow the lawn?

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.343
Why was homework really that important?

00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:27.267
Why couldn't I put jelly beans 
in my oatmeal?

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.123
My childhood was abound
with questions like this.

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:34.396
Normal things about being a kid
and realizing that sometimes,

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:38.479
it was best to listen to my parents
even when I didn't exactly understand why.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.495
And it's not that they didn't want
me to think critically.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.096
Their parenting always sought 
to reconcile the tension

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.547
between having my siblings and I
understand the realities of the world,

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.654
while ensuring that we never accepted
the status quo as inevitable.

00:00:51.654 --> 00:00:54.962
I came to realize that this,
in and of itself,

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:57.330
was a very purposeful form of education.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.170
One of my favorite educators,
Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.269
speaks quite explicitly
about the need for education

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.117
to be used as a tool for critical 
awakening and shared humanity.

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:12.642
In his most famous book,
"Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:17.156
he states, "No one can be 
authentically human

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.387
while he prevents others from being so."

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:23.987
I've been thinking a lot about this 
lately, this idea of humanity,

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:27.264
and specifically, who in this world
is afforded the privilege

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:30.280
of being perceived as fully human.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.610
Over the course of 
the past several months,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.818
the world has watched
as unarmed black men, and women,

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:39.755
have had their lives taken
at the hands of police and vigilante.

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:42.648
These events and all that 
has transpired after them

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:44.756
have brought me back to my own childhood

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:49.100
and the decisions that my parents made
about raising a black boy in America

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.207
that growing up, I didn't always
understand in the way that I do now.

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:58.212
I think of how hard it must have been,
how profoundly unfair it must have felt

00:01:58.212 --> 00:02:02.397
for them to feel like they had 
to strip away parts of my childhood

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.210
just so that I could come home at night.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.311
For example, I think of how one night,

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:11.213
when I was around 12 years old, on an
overnight field trip to another city,

00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:13.559
my friends and I bought Super Soakers

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.569
and turned the hotel parking lot
into our own water-filled battle zone.

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:19.805
We hid behind cars,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.973
running through the darkness that
lay between the streetlights,

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:26.384
boundless laughter ubiquitous 
across the pavement.

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:28.467
But within 10 minutes,

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.480
my father came outside, 
grabbed me by my forearm

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.505
and led me into our room
with an unfamiliar grip.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.369
Before I could say anything,

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.727
tell him how foolish he had 
made me look in front of my friends,

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:42.842
he derided me for being so naive.

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:47.385
Looked me in the eye, 
fear consuming his face,

00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:49.930
and said, "Son, I'm sorry,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.967
but you can't act the same 
as your white friends.

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:55.202
You can't pretend to shoot guns.

00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:57.088
You can't run around in the dark.

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:00.132
You can't hide behind anything
other than your own teeth."

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.135
I know now how scared he must have been,

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:07.148
how easily I could have fallen
into the empty of the night,

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:09.907
that some man would mistake this water

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:12.154
for a good reason to wash
all of this away.

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:16.546
These are the sorts of messages I've been
inundated with my entire life:

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:20.045
Always keep your hands where they 
can see them, don't move too quickly,

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:22.116
take off your hood when the sun goes down.

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:25.223
My parents raised me and my siblings
in an armor of advice,

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:28.854
an ocean of alarm bells so someone
wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:31.166
so that they wouldn't make
a memory of this skin.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.674
So that we could be kids, 
not casket or concrete.

00:03:33.674 --> 00:03:37.154
And it's not because they thought it
would make us better than anyone else

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:39.672
it's simply because they wanted 
to keep us alive.

00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:42.402
All of my black friends were raised
with the same message,

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:44.679
the talk, given to us 
when we became old enough

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.624
to be mistaken for a nail ready
to be hammered to the ground,

00:03:47.624 --> 00:03:52.118
when people made our melanin
synonymous with something to be feared.

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:54.591
But what does it do to a child

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:58.041
to grow up knowing that you
cannot simply be a child?

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:01.190
That the whims of adolescence
are too dangerous for your breath,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.854
that you cannot simply be curious,

00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:05.548
that you are not afforded the luxury
of making a mistake,

00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:07.316
that someone's implicit bias

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:09.826
might be the reason you don't
wake up in the morning.

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:11.871
But this cannot be what defines us.

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:14.462
Because we have parents
who raised us to understand

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.238
that our bodies weren't meant
for the backside of a bullet,

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:20.872
but for flying kites and jumping rope,
and laughing until our stomachs burst.

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.856
We had teachers who taught us 
how to raise our hands in class,

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:25.424
and not just to signal surrender,

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:27.390
and that the only thing we should give up

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.763
is the idea that we 
aren't worthy of this world.

00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:33.043
So when we say that black lives matter,
it's not because others don't,

00:04:33.043 --> 00:04:36.751
it's simply because we must affirm that we
are worthy of existing without fear,

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:38.877
when so many things tell us we are not.

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.839
I want to live in a world where my son

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.327
will not be presumed guilty
the moment he is born,

00:04:43.327 --> 00:04:47.178
where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken
for anything other than a toy.

00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:50.613
And I refuse to accept that we can't
build this world into something new,

00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:52.110
some place where a child's name

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.857
doesn't have to be written 
on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.474
where the value of someone's life

00:04:56.474 --> 00:05:00.273
isn't determined by anything other 
than the fact that they had lungs,

00:05:00.273 --> 00:05:04.491
a place where every single 
one of us can breathe.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:05.445
Thank you.

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:07.903
(Applause)
