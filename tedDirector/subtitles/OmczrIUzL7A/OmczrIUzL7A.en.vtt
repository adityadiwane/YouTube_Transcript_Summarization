00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and I've very rarely played

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
any new songs of my own.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And that was largely because there weren't any.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(Laughter)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
So I've been busy with a couple of projects,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and one of them was this:

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The Nutmeg.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
which I've been restoring in the garden

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
of my beach house in England.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And, so now,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
when the polar ice caps melt,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and I'll float off into the drowned world

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
During the day,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
the Nutmeg collects energy

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and from a 450 watt turbine

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
up the mast.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So that when it gets dark,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I've got plenty of power.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and I work on new songs.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I'd like to play to you guys,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
(Applause)

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
It's about Billie Holiday.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And it appears that,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
some night in 1947

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
she left her physical space

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and was missing all night,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
until she reappeared in the morning.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
But I know where she was.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
She was with me on my lifeboat.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And she was hot.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Music)

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
♫ Billie crept softly ♫

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
♫ into my waking arms ♫

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
♫ Strange fruit for ♫

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
♫ Panic at the stage door ♫

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
♫ Must have left the building ♫

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
♫ body and soul ♫

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
♫ On a creaky ♫

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
♫ piano stool tonight ♫

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
♫ as the moon is my ♫

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
♫ only witness ♫

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
♫ She was breathing ♫

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
♫ in my ear ♫

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
♫ See in the new age ♫

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
♫ alone ♫

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
♫ Stay with me ♫

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
♫ again tonight ♫

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
♫ Billie, time, ♫

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
♫ time is a wily trickster ♫

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
♫ Still an echo ♫

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
♫ in my heart says, ♫

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.260
(Applause)
