00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.620
In an age of global strife
and climate change,

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:19.106
I'm here to answer
the all important question:

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.201
Why is sex so damn good?

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.178
If you're laughing, you know what I mean.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:26.040
Now, before we get to that answer,

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:28.258
let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.949
Chris is a great friend of mine
from my university days,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:33.813
but secretly, I hate him.

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.733
Here's why. Back in university,
we had a quick project

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:38.715
to design some solar-powered clocks.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.269
Here's my clock.

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:42.746
It uses something called
the dwarf sunflower,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.092
which grows to about 12 inches in height.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.158
Now, as you know, sunflowers

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:49.394
track the sun
during the course of the day.

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:52.756
So in the morning, you see
which direction the sunflower is facing,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.946
and you mark it on the blank
area in the base.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.897
At noon, you mark the changed
position of the sunflower,

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.269
and in the evening again,
and that's your clock.

00:01:02.293 --> 00:01:04.855
Now, I know my clock doesn't
tell you the exact time,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.583
but it does give you a general
idea using a flower.

00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:10.699
So, in my completely unbiased,
subjective opinion,

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:12.418
it's brilliant.

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:15.244
However, here's Chris's clock.

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:19.295
It's five magnifying glasses
with a shot glass under each one.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.216
In each shot glass
is a different scented oil.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.735
In the morning, the sunlight
will shine down

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.394
on the first magnifying glass,

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.424
focusing a beam of light
on the shot glass underneath.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.623
This will warm up the scented oil inside,

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:33.207
and a particular smell will be emitted.

00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:35.279
A couple of hours later,
the sun will shine

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.576
on the next magnifying glass,
and a different smell will be emitted.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.257
So during the course of the day,
five different smells

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.292
are dispersed throughout that environment.

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.032
Anyone living in that house
can tell the time

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:48.504
just by the smell.

00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:50.857
You can see why I hate Chris.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.501
I thought my idea was pretty good,

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:54.892
but his idea is genius,

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.513
and at the time, I knew
his idea was better than mine,

00:01:57.537 --> 00:02:00.335
but I just couldn't explain why.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.865
One thing you have to know
about me is I hate to lose.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.727
This problem's been bugging me
for well over a decade.

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:11.087
All right, let's get back
to the question of why sex is so good.

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.948
Many years after the solar
powered clocks project,

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:17.652
a young lady I knew suggested
maybe sex is so good

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.592
because of the five senses.

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:22.401
And when she said this, I had an epiphany.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:26.132
So I decided to evaluate different
experiences I had in my life

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.620
from the point of view of the five senses.

00:02:28.644 --> 00:02:32.330
To do this, I devised something
called the five senses graph.

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:35.415
Along the y-axis, you have
a scale from zero to 10,

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.762
and along the x-axis, you have,
of course, the five senses.

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:41.346
Anytime I had a memorable
experience in my life,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.341
I would record it on this graph
like a five senses diary.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.533
Here's a quick video
to show you how it works.

00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:51.349
(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,

00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:53.993
and today, I'm going to show
you what riding motorbikes

00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:57.278
is like from the point of view
of the five senses. Hey!

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:00.884
Bike designer: This is [unclear],
custom bike designer.

00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:06.707
(Motorcyle revving)

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.011
[Sound]

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.087
[Touch]

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.702
[Sight]

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:50.623
[Smell]

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.653
[Taste]

00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:03.938
JL: And that's how the five senses
graph works.

00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:07.287
Now, for a period of three years,
I gathered data,

00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:10.043
not just me but also some of my friends,

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.544
and I used to teach
in university, so I forced my --

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:15.229
I mean, I asked my students
to do this as well.

00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:17.859
So here are some other results.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.096
The first is for instant noodles.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.156
Now obviously, taste
and smell are quite high,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.275
but notice sound is at three.

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:28.851
Many people told me a big part

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.873
of the noodle-eating experience
is the slurping noise.

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:34.255
You know. (Slurps)

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.074
Needless to say, I no longer
dine with these people.

00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:39.411
OK, next, clubbing.

00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:43.132
OK, here what I found interesting was

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:47.801
that taste is at four,
and many respondents told me

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:49.540
it's because of the taste of drinks,

00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:53.961
but also, in some cases, kissing is a big
part of the clubbing experience.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.769
These people I still do hang out with.

00:04:56.793 --> 00:04:59.113
All right, and smoking.

00:04:59.137 --> 00:05:04.160
Here I found touch is at [six],
and one of the reasons

00:05:04.184 --> 00:05:07.516
is that smokers told me the sensation
of holding a cigarette

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.213
and bringing it up to your lips is a big
part of the smoking experience,

00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:13.892
which shows, it's kind of scary to think

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.102
how well cigarettes are designed
by the manufacturers.

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:20.483
OK. Now, what would the perfect
experience

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:22.962
look like on the five senses graph?

00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:26.483
It would, of course, be
a horizontal line along the top.

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:29.063
Now you can see, not
even as intense an experience

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:31.296
as riding a motorbike comes close.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.838
In fact, in the years
that I gathered data,

00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:37.076
only one experience came close
to being the perfect one.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.701
That is, of course, sex. Great sex.

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:42.390
Respondents said that great sex

00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:46.245
hits all of the five senses
at an extreme level.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:48.365
Here I'll quote
one of my students who said,

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.602
"Sex is so good, it's good
even when it's bad."

00:05:52.626 --> 00:05:55.915
So the five senses
theory does help explain

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.032
why sex is so good.

00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.881
Now in the middle of all this
five senses work,

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:03.690
I suddenly remembered
the solar-powered clocks project

00:06:03.714 --> 00:06:04.767
from my youth.

00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.759
And I realized this theory
also explains why Chris's clock

00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:09.640
is so much better than mine.

00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:12.769
You see, my clock only focuses on sight,

00:06:12.793 --> 00:06:15.207
and a little bit of touch.

00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.190
Here's Chris's clock.

00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:21.839
It's the first clock ever
that uses smell to tell the time.

00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:23.905
In fact, in terms of the five senses,

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:26.918
Chris's clock is a revolution.

00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:29.556
And that's what this theory
taught me about my field.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.455
You see, up till now, us designers,

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.461
we've mainly focused on making
things look very pretty,

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:36.257
and a little bit of touch,

00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:39.436
which means we've ignored
the other three senses.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.906
Chris's clock shows us
that even raising just one

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.306
of those other senses can
make for a brilliant product.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.337
So what if we started using
the five senses theory

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:50.572
in all of our designs?

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:53.297
Here's three quick ideas I came up with.

00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:55.900
This is an iron, you
know, for your clothes,

00:06:55.924 --> 00:06:58.669
to which I added a spraying mechanism,

00:06:58.693 --> 00:07:01.220
so you fill up the vial
with your favorite scent,

00:07:01.244 --> 00:07:03.088
and your clothes will smell nicer,

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:04.684
but hopefully it should also make

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.692
the ironing experience more enjoyable.

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:09.864
We could call this "the perfumator."

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.349
All right, next.

00:07:11.373 --> 00:07:13.392
So I brush my teeth twice a day,

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.798
and what if we had a toothbrush

00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:17.494
that tastes like candy,

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:19.969
and when the taste of candy ran out,

00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:22.929
you'd know it's time
to change your toothbrush?

00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:27.508
Finally, I have a thing for the keys
on a flute or a clarinet.

00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:30.934
It's not just the way they look,
but I love the way they feel

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.164
when you press down on them.

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:35.304
Now, I don't play the flute
or the clarinet,

00:07:35.328 --> 00:07:39.440
so I decided to combine these keys
with an instrument I do play:

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.651
the television remote control.

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:45.943
Now, when we look at these
three ideas together,

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.863
you'll notice that the five senses theory

00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:51.867
doesn't only change the way
we use these products

00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:54.686
but also the way they look.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.738
So in conclusion, I've found
the five senses theory

00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:01.299
to be a very useful tool in evaluating

00:08:01.323 --> 00:08:02.895
different experiences in my life,

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.843
and then taking those best experiences

00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:08.491
and hopefully incorporating
them into my designs.

00:08:08.515 --> 00:08:12.408
Now, I realize the five senses
isn't the only thing

00:08:12.432 --> 00:08:14.326
that makes life interesting.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.545
There's also the six emotions

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:20.109
and that elusive x-factor.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:23.859
Maybe that could be
the topic of my next talk.

00:08:23.883 --> 00:08:26.268
Until then, please have fun

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:28.667
using the five senses in your own lives

00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.387
and your own designs.

00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.172
Oh, one last thing before I leave.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.482
Here's the experience you
all had while listening

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:36.731
to the TED Talks.

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:39.043
However, it would be better
if we could boost up

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:42.707
a couple of the other senses
like smell and taste.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.759
And the best way to do that is with

00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:47.412
free candy.

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:49.155
You guys ready?

00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:50.907
All right.

00:08:52.504 --> 00:08:58.303
(Applause)
