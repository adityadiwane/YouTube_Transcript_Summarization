00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Our face is hugely important

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
because it's the external, visual part

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that everybody else sees.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Let's not forget it's a functional entity.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
We have strong skull bones

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It's where our senses are located, our special senses --

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
our vision, our speech,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
our hearing, our smell, our taste.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And this bone

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
with cavities, the sinuses,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
which warm and moisten the air we breathe.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
our head would be dead weight,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we wouldn't be able to hold it erect,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
This woman is slowly dying

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
because the benign tumors in her facial bones

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
so she can't breathe and eat.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Attached to the facial bones

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
that define our face's structure

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
are the muscles that deliver our facial expression,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
our universal language of expression,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
our social-signaling system.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And overlying this is the skin drape,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
which is a hugely complex

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
three-dimensional structure --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
taking right-angled bends here and there,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
having thin areas like the eyelids,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
thick areas like the cheek, different colors.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And then we have the sensual factor of the face.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Where do we like to kiss people?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
It's the face where we're attracted to with that.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
But let's not forget the hair.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
You're looking at the image on your left-hand side --

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that's my son with his eyebrows present.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
There's a definite difference.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
he'd look even odder still.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Dysmorphophobia

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
is an extreme version

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of the fact that we don't see ourselves

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
as others see us.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It's a shocking truth

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that we only see mirror images of ourselves,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and we only see ourselves

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
in freeze-frame photographic images

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Dysmorphophobia

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
is a perversion of this

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
where people who may be very good looking

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
regard themselves as hideously ugly

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and are constantly seeking surgery

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
to correct their facial appearance.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
They don't need this. They need psychiatric help.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
In other words, he looks entirely normal.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Age is another thing

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
when our attitude toward our appearance changes.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
by the behavior of adults around them.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and she's having difficulty seeing.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
As you can see, it's blocking her vision.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
She's also in danger, when she damages this,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
of bleeding profusely.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Our research has shown

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
that the parents and close loved ones of these children

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
adore them.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
They've grown used to their face; they think they're special.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Actually, sometimes the parents argue

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
about whether these children should have the lesion removed.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
because the child they've grown to love

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But other adults

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
say incredibly painful things.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
They say, "How dare you take this child out of the house

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and terrify other people.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?"

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
because -- a natural curiosity.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And that obviously alerts the child

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to their unusual nature.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
After surgery, everything normalizes.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
The adults behave more naturally,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and the children play more readily with other children.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
As teenagers --

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
just think back to your teenage years --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
we're going through a dramatic

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and often disproportionate change

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
in our facial appearance.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We're trying to struggle to find our identity.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
We crave the approval of our peers.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
So our facial appearance is vital to us

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
as we're trying to project ourselves to the world.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Just remember that single acne spot

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that crippled you for several days.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
trying to raise one eyebrow?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
It's a crippling time.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and her lower lip jutting forward.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Turn to the person next to you,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and look at them -- they look miserable.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
That's exactly what people used to say to Sue.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
She wasn't miserable at all.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
People were making misjudgments all the time

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
on her mood.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
So she chose to have facial surgery.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
After the facial surgery,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
she said, "My face now reflects my personality.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
People know now that I'm enthusiastic,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that I'm a happy person."

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Is this change, though, a real change,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
or is it a figment of the imagination

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
of the patient themselves?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And what we found was --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
we jumbled up the photographs

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
so they couldn't recognize the before and after --

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
what we found was that the patients were regarded

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
as being more attractive after the surgery.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
on honesty, intelligence,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
friendliness, violence.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
They were all perceived as being

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
less than normal in all those characteristics --

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
more violent, etc. -- before the surgery.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
After the surgery,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
they were perceived as being more intelligent,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
more friendly, more honest, less violent --

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
or their character.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
When people get older,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Their presence in the consultation suite

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
What happens to them

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
So this is a photograph of Henry,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
his upper jaw, his eye-socket.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
He looks pretty good at this stage.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
as the disease ravaged his face

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I learned a huge amount from Henry.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Henry taught me

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
that you can carry on working.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
He enjoyed life to the full,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and a caring family

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and was able to participate socially.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
He maintained a calm insouciance.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
This was something more than that. He ignored it.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and carried on oblivious to it.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And that's what these people can do.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
This is a man in his 20s

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
It was my longest operation.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face --

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
his eye, his nose,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
the skull bones, the facial skin --

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and reconstructed him with tissue from the back.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And again, he said,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am."

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
His facial disfigurement

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
did not affect him

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
because he had the support of a family;

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
he had a successful, fulfilling job.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So we've seen that we can change people's faces.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But when we change people's faces,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
are we changing their identity --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
for better or for worse?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
For instance,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
there are two different types of facial surgery.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
We can categorize it like that.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
like Sue.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
When they have facial surgery,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
they feel their lives have changed

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
because other people perceive them

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
as better people.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
They don't feel different.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
They feel that they've actually gained

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
what they never had,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
that their face now reflects their personality.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and this kind of surgery.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
might be regarded as cosmetic."

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
They're trying to achieve difference in their lives.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
She was just trying to achieve the face

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
that matched her personality.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
But then we have other people

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
who don't choose to have facial surgery.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
They're people who have their face shot off.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
They have it forced upon them.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And again, as I told you,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
if they have a caring family

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and good work life,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Their identity doesn't change.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Is this business

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
about appearance and preoccupation with it

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
a Western phenomenon?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Muzetta's family give the lie to this.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
which has already made her blind

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
After she had surgery to remove the tumor,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
a pink ribbon in her hair,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and the mother wore a full burqa.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
We make judgments on people's faces

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
all the time.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and the way he would define criminal faces.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
He said you could see criminal faces,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
judging them just on the photographs that were showed.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Good-looking people

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
are always judged as being more friendly.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
We look at O.J. --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
he's a good-looking guy.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and actually he's not the good guy.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And beauty doesn't equate to goodness,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
So we've talked about the static face

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and judging the static face,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
but actually, we're more comfortable

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
with judging the moving face.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
We think we can judge people on their expressions.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
like to see a live witness

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
the blink, the hesitation.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And so they want to see live witnesses.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
we can make a judgment on somebody's face.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
our financial adviser's face was covered?

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
We'd be pretty uncomfortable.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
But are we good at making the judgments

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
on facial appearance and movement?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
If you spend five minutes with somebody,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
you start looking beyond their facial appearance,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and the people who you're initially attracted to

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
may seem boring and you lose interest in them,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and the people who you didn't immediately seek out,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
because you didn't find them particularly attractive,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
become attractive people

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
because of their personality.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
So we've talked a lot about facial appearance.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
I now want to share

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
a little bit of the surgery that we do --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
where we're at and where we're going.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
This is an image of Ann

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And you can see in the images afterward,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
we've managed to reconstruct her successfully.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
But that's not good enough.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
she wants to be out climbing mountains.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
This is a horrific image,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
so I'm putting my hand up now.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
This is a photograph of Adi,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
in an armed robbery.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and his upper jaw and teeth.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
This is the bar that he set for us.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So with modern technology,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
we used computers to make models.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
We then bent a plate up to it.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
We put it in place

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
so we knew it was an accurate position.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
We then put bone and tissue from the back.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Here you can see the plate holding it,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and you can see the implants being put in --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
so that in one operation

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
we achieve this

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and this.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
So the patient's life is restored.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
That's the good news.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
However, his chin skin

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
doesn't look the same as it did before.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
It's skin from his back.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And that's where we're failing,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and that's where we need the face transplant.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
The face transplant has a role

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
probably in burns patients to replace the skin.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
So it's very valuable

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
to have that tool in our armamentarium.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
But the patients are going to have to take drugs

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
What does that mean?

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
This is not a life-saving transplant --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it is a quality-of-life transplant,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and as a result,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
We also don't know what they feel

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
about recognition and identity.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
are studying that.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Donors are going to be short on the ground,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
because how many people want to have their loved one's face

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
removed at the point of death?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
So there are going to be problems

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
with face transplantation.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
So the better news is

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
the future's almost here --

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and the future is tissue engineering.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Just imagine,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
I can make a biologically-degradable template.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
I can put it in place where it's meant to be.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
I can sprinkle a few cells,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
stem cells from the patient's own hip,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
a little bit of genetically engineered protein,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
But we've still got problems.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
We've got mouth cancer to solve.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
We're still not reconstructing them well enough.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
In the U.K. we have an epidemic

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
of facial injuries among young people.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
We still can't get rid of scars.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
We need to do research.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And the best news of all

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
is that surgeons know

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
that we need to do research.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And we've set up charities

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
that will help us fund

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
the clinical research

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
to determine the best treatment practice now

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
and better treatment into the future,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
Let's leave it as it is."

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Thank you very much indeed.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
(Applause)
