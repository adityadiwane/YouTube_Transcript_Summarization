00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to share with you the story

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
as to how I have become

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
In November of 2003,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I was invited to take part

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
46664 Foundation --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And 46664 is the number

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
onstage, having the time of my life.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
The next day, all the artists were invited

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to join Mandela in Robben Island,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
where he was going to give a conference

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to the world's press,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
standing in front of his former prison cell.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
You can see the bars of the window there.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
In that moment in time,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Mandela told the world's press

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that there was a virtual genocide

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
taking place in his country;

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that post-apartheid

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Rainbow Nation,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and that the front line victims,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the most vulnerable of all,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
were women and children.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
This was a huge impact on my mind,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
because I am a woman and I am a mother,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and I hadn't realized

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that the HIV/AIDS pandemic

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
was directly affecting women in such a way.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
when I left Capetown,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I told myself, "This is going to be something

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that I have to talk about.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I have to serve."

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And so, subsequently

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I participated in every single

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
46664 event

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that I could take part in

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and gave news conferences,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
interviews,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
talking and using my platform as a musician,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
with my commitment to Mandela --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
out of respect for the tremendous,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
unbelievable work that he had done.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But do they all know

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
about what has been taking place in South Africa,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
his country,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
the country that had one of the highest incidents

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
of transmission of the virus?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I think that if I went out into the street now

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and I told people what was happening there,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
they would be shocked.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to have met Zackie Achmat,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
an incredible campaigner and activist.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
I met him at a 46664 event.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
This is a tool --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
this tells you I am in solidarity

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
with people who have HIV,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
people who are living with HIV.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
It doesn't have to be in the closet."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and I'm very proud to be a member

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of that incredible organization.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
It's a grassroots campaign

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
with 80 percent membership being women,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
most of whom are HIV-positive.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
They work in the field.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
They have tremendous outreach

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
to the people who are living directly

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
with the effects of the virus.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
They have education programs.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
They bring out the issues of stigma.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
It's quite extraordinary what they do.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And yes, my SING Campaign

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
has supported Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and to try to also raise funds.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and the incredible work that they do,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So this is my SING Campaign.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
SING Campaign is basically just me

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and about three or four wonderful people

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
who help to support me.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I've traveled all over the world

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
in the last two and a half years --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I went to about 12 different countries.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
getting a nice, fat check;

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
who ended up in tears

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
because I use film clips

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that people are tending to avoid,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
because they are fatigued,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
attended that concert

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and I had an opportunity to meet with him,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and he gave his absolute commitment

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to try to making a change,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
which is absolutely necessary.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This is in the Scottish Parliament.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I've subsequently become an envoy

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
for Scotland and HIV.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And I was showing them my experiences

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and trying to, again, raise awareness.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And once again, in Edinburgh

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
because of their family being affected

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
by the AIDS virus.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
he's the director of UNAIDS.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And I'm very honored

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
by the fact that Michel invited me,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
only a few months ago,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and broadening my outreach.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
The message that UNAIDS

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
are currently sending out to the world

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
of the transmission of the virus

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
from mother to child by 2015.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
It's a very ambitious goal

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
This can happen.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And here I am with a pregnant woman,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
who is HIV positive

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
because we know that that young woman

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
is receiving treatment

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
so her life can be extended

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And her baby will receive PMTCT,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
which will mean that that baby

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
can be born free of the virus.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Now that is prevention

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
at the very beginning of life.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It's one way to start looking at intervention

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
with the AIDS pandemic.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Now, I just would like to finish off

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
to tell you the little story

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
about Avelile.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
This is Avelile --

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
she goes with me wherever I go.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I tell her story to everyone

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
because she represents

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
one of millions

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
of HIV/AIDS orphans.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Avelile's mother

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
had HIV virus --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
she died

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
from AIDS-related illness.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Avelile had the virus,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
she was born with the virus.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And here she is at seven years old,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
At this point in her life,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and had pneumonia.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
They put her on very special nutritious diet

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and took great care of her.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and left us feeling very resonant

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
with this direct experience, this one child,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
you know, that story.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Five months later,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
we went back to South Africa

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
to meet Avelile again.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And I'm getting --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
This is the transformation that took place.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Isn't it extraordinary?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:15.260
(Applause)

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
That round of applause is actually

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So, I would like to say to you,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
each one in the audience,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
if you feel that every mother

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and every child in the world

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
has the right to have access

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to good nutrition and good medical care,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
specifically five and six,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
should be absolutely committed to

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
by all governments around the world --

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
especially in sub-Saharan Africa --

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
could you please stand up.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
I think that's fair to say,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
it's almost everyone in the hall.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Thank you very much.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
(Applause)
