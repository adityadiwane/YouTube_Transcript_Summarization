00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.590
In my early days as a graduate student,

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:18.169
I went on a snorkeling trip
off the coast of the Bahamas.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.558
I'd actually never swum
in the ocean before,

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:23.426
so it was a bit terrifying.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.836
What I remember the most is,
as I put my head in the water

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.110
and I was trying really hard
to breathe through the snorkel,

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:36.500
this huge group
of striped yellow and black fish

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:38.007
came straight at me ...

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.034
and I just froze.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:44.408
And then, as if it had
suddenly changed its mind,

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:46.869
came towards me
and then swerved to the right

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:48.408
and went right around me.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.266
It was absolutely mesmerizing.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.472
Maybe many of you
have had this experience.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.481
Of course, there's the color
and the beauty of it,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.433
but there was also
just the sheer oneness of it,

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:01.800
as if it wasn't hundreds of fish

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:04.959
but a single entity
with a single collective mind

00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:06.490
that was making decisions.

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:11.168
When I look back, I think that experience
really ended up determining

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:13.414
what I've worked on for most of my career.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:17.257
I'm a computer scientist,

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:20.028
and the field that I work in
is artificial intelligence.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:21.976
And a key theme in AI

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.443
is being able to understand intelligence
by creating our own computational systems

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.720
that display intelligence
the way we see it in nature.

00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:34.725
Now, most popular views of AI, of course,
come from science fiction and the movies,

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.326
and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.210
But that tends to be a very human-centric
view of intelligence.

00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:45.171
When you think of a fish school,

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:48.148
or when I think of a flock of starlings,

00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:51.512
that feels like a really different
kind of intelligence.

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:56.678
For starters, any one fish is just so tiny

00:01:56.702 --> 00:01:59.589
compared to the sheer size
of the collective,

00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:02.723
so it seems that any one individual

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.740
would have a really limited
and myopic view of what's going on,

00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.098
and intelligence
isn't really about the individual

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:10.799
but somehow a property
of the group itself.

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:15.169
Secondly, and the thing
that I still find most remarkable,

00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:20.225
is that we know that there are no leaders
supervising this fish school.

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.484
Instead, this incredible
collective mind behavior

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:29.040
is emerging purely from the interactions
of one fish and another.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:33.032
Somehow, there are these interactions
or rules of engagement

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:34.811
between neighboring fish

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:36.302
that make it all work out.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.207
So the question for AI then becomes,

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.389
what are those rules of engagement
that lead to this kind of intelligence,

00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:46.320
and of course, can we create our own?

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.406
And that's the primary thing
that I work on with my team in my lab.

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:52.400
We work on it through theory,

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:54.772
looking at abstract rule systems

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:57.145
and thinking about
the mathematics behind it.

00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:02.002
We also do it through biology,
working closely with experimentalists.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.352
But mostly, we do it through robotics,

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:08.280
where we try to create
our own collective systems

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:11.011
that can do the kinds of things
that we see in nature,

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.272
or at least try to.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.531
One of our first robotic quests
along this line

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:20.600
was to create our very own colony
of a thousand robots.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.294
So very simple robots,

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:25.921
but they could be programmed
to exhibit collective intelligence,

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:27.674
and that's what we were able to do.

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:30.046
So this is what a single robot looks like.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.593
It's quite small,
about the size of a quarter,

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:34.927
and you can program how it moves,

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.367
but it can also wirelessly
communicate with other robots,

00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:40.558
and it can measure distances from them.

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:44.058
And so now we can start to program
exactly an interaction,

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:46.176
a rule of engagement between neighbors.

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:48.427
And once we have this system,

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:51.867
we can start to program many
different kinds of rules of engagement

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:53.397
that you would see in nature.

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:56.397
So for example,
spontaneous synchronization,

00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:01.659
how audiences are clapping
and suddenly start all clapping together,

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:03.751
the fireflies flashing together.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.430
We can program rules
for pattern formation,

00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:11.240
how cells in a tissue

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:13.366
determine what role
they're going to take on

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.096
and set the patterns of our bodies.

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:18.954
We can program rules for migration,

00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:21.955
and in this way, we're really learning
from nature's rules.

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:25.062
But we can also take it a step further.

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:28.078
We can actually take these rules
that we've learned from nature

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:31.896
and combine them and create
entirely new collective behaviors

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.118
of our very own.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.258
So for example,

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:37.634
imagine that you had
two different kinds of rules.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.313
So your first rule is a motion rule

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:44.678
where a moving robot can move
around other stationary robots.

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:46.513
And your second rule is a pattern rule

00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:49.694
where a robot takes on a color
based on its two nearest neighbors.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.944
So if I start with a blob of robots
in a little pattern seed,

00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:56.874
it turns out that these two rules
are sufficient for the group

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:59.650
to be able to self-assemble
a simple line pattern.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.478
And if I have more
complicated pattern rules,

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.819
and I design error correction rules,

00:05:05.843 --> 00:05:08.940
we can actually create really,
really complicated self assemblies,

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:10.608
and here's what that looks like.

00:05:11.694 --> 00:05:14.679
So here, you're going to see
a thousand robots

00:05:14.703 --> 00:05:18.165
that are working together
to self-assemble the letter K.

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.495
The K is on its side.

00:05:20.043 --> 00:05:22.774
And the important thing
is that no one is in charge.

00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:27.623
So any single robot is only talking
to a small number of robots nearby it,

00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:31.584
and it's using its motion rule
to move around the half-built structure

00:05:31.608 --> 00:05:34.615
just looking for a place to fit in
based on its pattern rules.

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:40.012
And even though no robot
is doing anything perfectly,

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:43.696
the rules are such that we can get
the collective to do its goal

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.193
robustly together.

00:05:45.853 --> 00:05:48.835
And the illusion becomes
almost so perfect, you know --

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:52.275
you just start to not even notice
that they're individual robots at all,

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:53.982
and it becomes a single entity,

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.727
kind of like the school of fish.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:02.572
So these are robots and rules
in two dimensions,

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:05.907
but we can also think about robots
and rules in three dimensions.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.534
So what if we could create robots
that could build together?

00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:13.651
And here, we can take inspiration
from social insects.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.669
So if you think about
mound-building termites

00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:18.745
or you think about army ants,

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:23.022
they create incredible,
complex nest structures out of mud

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:25.190
and even out of their own bodies.

00:06:26.422 --> 00:06:28.642
And like the system I showed you before,

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:31.636
these insects actually
also have pattern rules

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.698
that help them determine what to build,

00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:36.024
but the pattern can be made
out of other insects,

00:06:36.048 --> 00:06:37.835
or it could be made out of mud.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:43.359
And we can use that same idea
to create rules for robots.

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:47.202
So here, you're going to see
some simulated robots.

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:49.709
So the simulated robot has a motion rule,

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:52.066
which is how it traverses
through the structure,

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.087
looking for a place to fit in,

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.111
and it has pattern rules
where it looks at groups of blocks

00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:59.340
to decide whether to place a block.

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:03.527
And with the right motion rules
and the right pattern rules,

00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:07.186
we can actually get the robots
to build whatever we want.

00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:10.708
And of course, everybody wants
their own tower.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.152
(Laughter)

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.504
So once we have these rules,

00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:18.694
we can start to create the robot bodies
that go with these rules.

00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:22.027
So here, you see a robot
that can climb over blocks,

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:24.732
but it can also lift and move these blocks

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:27.453
and it can start to edit
the very structure that it's on.

00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:29.585
But with these rules,

00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:33.088
this is really only one kind of robot body
that you could imagine.

00:07:33.112 --> 00:07:35.691
You could imagine
many different kinds of robot bodies.

00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:40.325
So if you think about robots
that maybe could move sandbags

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.898
and could help build levees,

00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:47.223
or we could think of robots
that built out of soft materials

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:50.891
and worked together
to shore up a collapsed building --

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:53.913
so just the same kind of rules
in different kinds of bodies.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.253
Or if, like my group, you are completely
obsessed with army ants,

00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:04.651
then maybe one day we can make robots
that can climb over literally anything

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:06.849
including other members of their tribe,

00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:09.222
and self-assemble things
out of their own bodies.

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:11.638
Once you understand the rules,

00:08:11.662 --> 00:08:15.041
just many different kinds
of robot visions become possible.

00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:20.846
And coming back to the snorkeling trip,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:26.215
we actually understand a great deal
about the rules that fish schools use.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.425
So if we can invent
the bodies to go with that,

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:30.877
then maybe there is a future

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:35.423
where I and my group will get to snorkel
with a fish school of our own creation.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.799
Each of these systems that I showed you

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:47.100
brings us closer to having
the mathematical and the conceptual tools

00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:50.505
to create our own versions
of collective power,

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:53.530
and this can enable many different kinds
of future applications,

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:56.718
whether you think about robots
that build flood barriers

00:08:56.742 --> 00:09:01.039
or you think about robotic bee colonies
that could pollinate crops

00:09:01.063 --> 00:09:04.587
or underwater schools of robots
that monitor coral reefs,

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.714
or if we reach for the stars
and we thinking about programming

00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:09.357
constellations of satellites.

00:09:09.968 --> 00:09:11.580
In each of these systems,

00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:15.151
being able to understand
how to design the rules of engagement

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:17.689
and being able to create
good collective behavior

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:20.087
becomes a key to realizing these visions.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:26.669
So, so far I've talked about
rules for insects and for fish

00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:29.062
and for robots,

00:09:29.086 --> 00:09:32.189
but what about the rules that apply
to our own human collective?

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:35.116
And the last thought
that I'd like to leave you with

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.821
is that science is of course itself

00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:40.329
an incredible manifestation
of collective intelligence,

00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:43.671
but unlike the beautiful
fish schools that I study,

00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:47.638
I feel we still have a much longer
evolutionary path to walk.

00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:53.170
So in addition to working on improving
the science of robot collectives,

00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:56.471
I also work on creating robots
and thinking about rules

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.955
that will improve
our own scientific collective.

00:10:00.018 --> 00:10:01.686
There's this saying that I love:

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.114
who does science
determines what science gets done.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.000
Imagine a society

00:10:09.024 --> 00:10:10.675
where we had rules of engagement

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:14.002
where every child grew up believing
that they could stand here

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.448
and be a technologist of the future,

00:10:16.472 --> 00:10:17.973
or where every adult

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:22.116
believed that they had the ability
not just to understand but to change

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.695
how science and technology
impacts their everyday lives.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.539
What would that society look like?

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:31.714
I believe that we can do that.

00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:34.029
I believe that we can choose our rules,

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:35.810
and we engineer not just robots

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:38.430
but we can engineer
our own human collective,

00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:42.288
and if we do and when we do,
it will be beautiful.

00:10:42.312 --> 00:10:43.463
Thank you.

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:50.034
