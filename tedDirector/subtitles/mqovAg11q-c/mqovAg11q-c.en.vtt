00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.610
I'm an artist and I cut books.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.316
This is one of my first book works.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.340
It's called "Alternate
Route to Knowledge."

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.132
I wanted to create a stack of books so
that somebody could come into the gallery

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:24.952
and think they're just looking
at a regular stack of books,

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:28.441
but then as they got closer they would
see this rough hole carved into it,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.417
and wonder what was happening,
wonder why,

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.453
and think about the material of the book.

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:34.543
So I'm interested in the texture,

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:38.663
but I'm more interested in the text
and the images that we find within books.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:43.524
In most of my work, what I do is I seal
the edges of a book with a thick varnish

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:46.334
so it's creating sort of a skin
on the outside of the book

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:50.202
so it becomes a solid material,
but then the pages inside are still loose,

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.352
and then I carve
into the surface of the book,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.883
and I'm not moving or adding anything.

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:57.762
I'm just carving around
whatever I find interesting.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:01:00.223
So everything you see
within the finished piece

00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:02.996
is exactly where it was
in the book before I began.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.014
I think of my work as sort of
a remix, in a way,

00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:09.345
because I'm working with
somebody else's material

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.973
in the same way that a D.J. might be
working with somebody else's music.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:16.918
This was a book of Raphael paintings,
the Renaissance artist,

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:21.353
and by taking his work
and remixing it, carving into it,

00:01:21.353 --> 00:01:25.045
I'm sort of making it into something
that's more new and more contemporary.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:29.781
I'm thinking also about breaking out
of the box of the traditional book

00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:31.917
and pushing that linear format,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:35.900
and try to push the structure
of the book itself

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.423
so that the book can become
fully sculptural.

00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:45.068
I'm using clamps and ropes
and all sorts of materials, weights,

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:48.040
in order to hold things 
in place before I varnish

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.600
so that I can push the form 
before I begin,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.242
so that something like this
can become a piece like this,

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:58.130
which is just made
from a single dictionary.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.368
Or something like this
can become a piece like this.

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:08.244
Or something like this,

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:12.255
which who knows what that's going to be
or why that's in my studio,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:16.274
will become a piece like this.

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:20.685
So I think one of the reasons
people are disturbed by destroying books,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.228
people don't want to rip books

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:24.359
and nobody really wants
to throw away a book,

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.552
is that we think about books
as living things,

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:28.223
we think about them as a body,

00:02:28.223 --> 00:02:31.313
and they're created
to relate to our body, as far as scale,

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:33.741
but they also have the potential
to continue to grow

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.731
and to continue to become new things.

00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.458
So books really are alive.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.988
So I think of the book as a body,

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:43.692
and I think of the book as a technology.

00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:46.081
I think of the book as a tool.

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.435
And I also think of the book as a machine.

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:54.809
I also think of the book as a landscape.

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:59.081
This is a full set of encyclopedias
that's been connected and sanded together,

00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:01.334
and as I carve through it,

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:03.275
I'm deciding what I want to choose.

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.863
So with encyclopedias,
I could have chosen anything,

00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:08.530
but I specifically chose
images of landscapes.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.966
And with the material itself,
I'm using sandpaper

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.658
and sanding the edges
so not only the images suggest landscape,

00:03:16.658 --> 00:03:19.366
but the material itself
suggests a landscape as well.

00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:24.889
So one of the things I do
is when I'm carving through the book,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.570
I'm thinking about images,
but I'm also thinking about text,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.775
and I think about them
in a very similar way,

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:33.647
because what's interesting
is that when we're reading text,

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.146
when we're reading a book,

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:36.615
it puts images in our head,

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.638
so we're sort of filling that piece.

00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:42.039
We're sort of creating images
when we're reading text,

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.916
and when we're looking at an image,
we actually use language

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:47.632
in order to understand
what we're looking at.

00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:49.861
So there's sort of
a yin-yang that happens,

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:51.138
sort of a flip flop.

00:03:51.138 --> 00:03:56.677
So I'm creating a piece
that the viewer is completing themselves.

00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:00.960
And I think of my work
as almost an archaeology.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.979
I'm excavating and I'm trying
to maximize the potential

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.068
and discover as much as I possibly can

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:08.709
and exposing it within my own work.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.896
But at the same time,

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:13.870
I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.351
and what's happening now that most
of our information is intangible,

00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:21.393
and this idea of loss,

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:25.711
and this idea that not only is the format
constantly shifting within computers,

00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.033
but the information itself,

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.262
now that we don't have a physical backup,

00:04:30.262 --> 00:04:35.843
has to be constantly updated
in order to not lose it.

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.623
And I have several dictionaries
in my own studio,

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:41.140
and I do use a computer every day,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.933
and if I need to look up a word,
I'll go on the computer,

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:47.259
because I can go directly
and instantly to what I'm looking up.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.209
I think that the book was never really

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:52.204
the right format
for nonlinear information,

00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:54.278
which is why we're seeing reference books

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:58.153
becoming the first to be 
endangered or extinct.

00:05:01.743 --> 00:05:04.510
So I don't think that the book
will ever really die.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.806
People think that now that we have
digital technology,

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:10.178
the book is going to die,

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:13.381
and we are seeing things shifting
and things evolving.

00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.505
I think that the book will evolve,

00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.767
and just like people said
painting would die

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:23.167
when photography and printmaking
became everyday materials,

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.154
but what it really allowed painting to do

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:27.706
was it allowed painting
to quit its day job.

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:34.021
It allowed painting to not have to have
that everyday chore of telling the story,

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:37.435
and painting became free
and was allowed to tell its own story,

00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:39.512
and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:41.754
and we saw painting
go into different branches.

00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:44.238
And I think that's what's
happening with books now,

00:05:44.238 --> 00:05:46.933
now that most of our technology,
most of our information,

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:51.127
most of our personal and cultural 
records are in digital form,

00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:54.079
I think it's really allowing the book
to become something new.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.869
So I think it's a very exciting time
for an artist like me,

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:00.439
and it's very exciting to see what
will happen with the book in the future.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:01.768
Thank you.

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:05.576
(Applause)
