00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So as a fashion designer,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I've always tended to think of materials

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
something like this,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
or this,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
or maybe this.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
But then I met a biologist,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and now I think of materials like this --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
green tea, sugar,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
a few microbes and a little time.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
which is a symbiotic mix

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
which spin cellulose

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
in a fermentation process.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Over time, these tiny threads

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
form in the liquid into layers

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and produce a mat on the surface.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
So we start by brewing the tea.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and then pour it into a growth bath.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
We need to check that the temperature

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
has cooled to below 30 degrees C.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And then we're ready to add the living organism.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And along with that, some acetic acid.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And once you get this process going,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
you can actually recycle

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
your previous fermented liquid.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and a thermostat to regulate it.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So this is my mini fabric farm.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
After about three days,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And the bacteria are feeding

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
of pure cellulose.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And they're sticking together, forming layers

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and giving us a sheet on the surface.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
After about two to three weeks,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So the bath on the left is after five days,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and on the right, after 10.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And this is a static culture.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
You don't have to do anything to it;

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
you just literally watch it grow.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It doesn't need light.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and you wash it in cold, soapy water.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
At this point, it's really heavy.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
It's over 90 percent water,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
so we need to let that evaporate.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Again, you can do that outside

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and just let it dry in the air.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And as it's drying, it's compressing,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is something that's either

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
like a really light-weight, transparent paper,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And then you can either cut that out

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and sew it conventionally,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
or you can use the wet material

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
to form it around a three-dimensional shape.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And as it evaporates,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
it will knit itself together, forming seams.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
which intrigues me.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Since it's organic,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I can make it change color without using dye

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
by a process of iron oxidation.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Using fruit and vegetable staining,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
create organic patterning.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And using indigo,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
make it anti-microbial.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And in fact, cotton

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
would take up to 18 dips in indigo

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to achieve a color this dark.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
it just takes one, and a really short one at that.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So if I was to walk outside in the rain

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
wearing this dress today,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I would immediately start to absorb

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
huge amounts of water.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
The dress would get really heavy,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
leaving me feeling rather naked.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Possibly a good performance piece,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
What I'm looking for

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
is a way to give the material

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the qualities that I need.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
So what I want to do is say to a future bug,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
"Spin me a thread.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Align it in this direction.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Make it hydrophobic.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And while you're at it,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
just form it around this 3D shape."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and possibly in the future

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
for biocompatible blood vessels,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
possibly even replacement bone tissue.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
But with synthetic biology,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
to produce something

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that gives us the quality,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
quantity and shape

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
of material that we desire.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
because then I start to think, wow,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
we could actually imagine

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
growing consumable products.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
What excites me about using microbes

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
is their efficiency.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
So we only grow what we need.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
There's no waste.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
so for example,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
a waste sugar stream

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
from a food processing plant.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
along with your vegetable peelings.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
is going to be a replacement

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
for cotton, leather or other textile materials.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.260
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
to our increasingly precious natural resources.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
where we see these microbes have their impact.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
We could, for example, imagine

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
growing a lamp, a chair,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a car or maybe even a house.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
So I guess what my question to you is:

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
in the future, what would you choose to grow?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:08.260
(Applause)

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
This is one of the jackets you grew?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
SL: Yes, it is.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
because this one

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
(Laughter)

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
(Applause)
