00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
So what's image got do with it?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.330
a lot of subliminal messages,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
that have come up.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
But I'm going to try and do something different,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.330
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
that we've been talking about.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.330
as you can see.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
We're not the only ones.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
(Laughter)

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.330
(Applause)

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
And you know, it's amazing.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.330
I mean, we need a whole conference

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Just think about that, you know?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
And this is typically what we've been talking about,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
the role that the media plays in focusing

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
just on the negative stuff.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
Now, why is that a problem?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
A typical disaster story:

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
disease, corruption, poverty.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And some of you might be standing here thinking,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
and all you privileged people come here, saying,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.330
'Forget the poor people.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
who really need help."

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.330
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.330
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.330
We start with poverty.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
or being able to support family.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
When things were bad, we had porridge.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
And like many African families,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.330
my parents could never save

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.330
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and things were always dicey.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.330
which was free.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
And they adopted a very interesting

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
approach to education, which was

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.330
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And what happened was,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
I got kicked out pretty much every term.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.330
You know, someone would come in with a list

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
of the people who haven't paid school fees,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and when they started getting pretty strict,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And I remember thinking, I mean,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Because you know, as a kid

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
you're embarrassed and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.330
you're sensitive, and everyone knows

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.330
you guys don't have money.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
But they kept at it,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and I now understand why they did what they did.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
They talk about corruption.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.330
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
and provincial schools.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.330
a national school.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.330
I missed the cutoff by one point.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.330
And my father said, "OK, listen.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
You know, it's just one point. I mean,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
So we went to the school,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.330
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and because my father didn't have the right last name,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
he was treated like dirt.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.330
you know, who do you think you are?

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And, you know, you must be joking if you think

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.330
you can get a slot.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.330
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
and who had done much, much worse than I did,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
and they had slots there.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
being humiliated in front of you, you know?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
And we left, and I swore to myself,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
to beg for anything in my life."

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
They called me two weeks later, they're like,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.330
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.330
Disease.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.330
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
He never told anyone that he had AIDS,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
his fear of the stigma was so strong.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.330
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
And I was in the States at the time,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
Because of doctor-patient privilege,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.330
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
read about the disease,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
I pretty much realized what was going on.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
The first time he got sick, he recovered.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
But what happened was that he had to be on medication

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.330
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.330
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
You know, so money ran out.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
He got sick again.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
and he used to import, bring him, could

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
get him a generic version of it.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
And that kept him going.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
But the money ran out.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.330
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
for him to start the treatment until Monday.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.330
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
And finally, we figured, well, OK,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.330
At least he'll get treated

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
while we try to figure out the money situation.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
And he died when the ambulance was coming

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
to the hospital to take him.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.330
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
imagine if this is all you know about me.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
How would you look at me?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
With pity, you know. Sadness.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
And this is how you look at Africa.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
This is the damage it causes.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
You don't see the other side of me.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.330
You don't see the blogger,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
the vibrant person, you know?

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
And I just wanted to personalize that.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Because we talk about it in big terms,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
and you wonder, you know, so what?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
But it's damaging.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
And I'm not unique, right?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Imagine if all you knew about William

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
And I was just moved.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
I was actually crying during his presentation.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
He was like, I try and I make.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
(Laughter)

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.330
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
When you focus just on the disasters --

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:08.330
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
-- we're ignoring the potential.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
So, what is to be done?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.330
First of all,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
We heard about that yesterday.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
We had some of them this morning.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
And this is an example, you know,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
blogging is one way of doing that.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
that was developed in South Africa.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.330
So we need to start getting better.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.330
And going back to the point I was trying to make,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
this is the Swahili Wikipedia.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.330
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
It only has five contributors.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.330
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
He's the only African who's contributing to this.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
People, please. We can't whine and complain

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.330
the West is doing this.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
What are we doing?

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Why are we not generating our own content?

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
Reuters now integrates African blogs

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
into their coverage of Africa.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.330
So, that's a start,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
and we've heard of all their other initiatives.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.330
The cheetah generation.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And after all the hoopla of Live 8,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
we're still not anywhere in the picture.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
No, you're not.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:53.330
(Laughter)

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
But the point I'm trying to make, though,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.330
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And for those of you in the diaspora

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
who are struggling with where should I be,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.330
should I move back,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.330
should I stay?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
You know, just jump.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
The continent needs you.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.330
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
Covington and Burling, six figures.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
With two paychecks, or three paychecks,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
And because I'm needed here, you know?

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
I probably can win a prize for the most ways

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
to use a Harvard Law School degree

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
because of all the things I'm doing.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.330
One is because I'm pretty aggressive,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and I try and find, you know, opportunities.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
But there is such a need, you know?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.330
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
for an organization called Enablis

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
We're now moving into East Africa.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
And we give them business development services,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
as well as financing loan and equity.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
I've also set up a project in Kenya,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
and what we do is we track the performance

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.330
of Kenyan MPs.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.330
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
Everything else on there is a labor of love.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
We've manually entered all the data there.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
And you can get profiles of each MP,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
questions they've asked in parliament.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
We have a comment function,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
where people can ask their MPs questions.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
There are some MPs who participate,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.330
and come back and ask.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
And basically, we started this because we were tired

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
of complaining about our politicians.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
You're not just going to be accountable

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.330
out of the goodness of your heart.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
What are they doing?

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.330
You know, they're not going to change

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
just out of nowhere.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
So we need new policies, we need --

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
where's that coming from, you know?

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
Another thing is that these leaders

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
are a reflection of our society.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
We talk about African governments

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
They come from us.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.330
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
And how can we change that?

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.330
inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
Where do we go from here?

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
I believe in the power of ideas.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.330
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
because it can make a difference.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
The other thing I want to urge you to do

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
is take an interest in the individual.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
I've had lots of conversations about things I think

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
need to be happening in Africa.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.330
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.330
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
"BBut it's not scalable, you know.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
Give me something I can do with Paypal."

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
It's not that easy, you know?

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.330
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
because usually the individual in Africa

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
carries a lot of people behind them.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.330
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
I was helping her pay her tuition.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.330
I was paying her school fees.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
You know, she's now my baby sister.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
I am able to lift all those people.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
So, don't underestimate that.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
An example. This man changed my life.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.330
because he took an interest.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
this is an overeager student,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
which we don't normally get in the United States,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
because everyone else is cynical and jaded.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.330
He called me to his office and said,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.330
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.330
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
And he was like, "Why? You know,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
we don't need another lawyer in the United States."

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
And he tried to talk me out of it,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.330
I'm poli-sci Ph.D.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.330
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.330
what I need to do to help you out."

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.330
And to me at that time university --

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
and that was like heaven, OK,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
you have all these things going for you."

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
for applying to law school.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.330
you're that good, OK?

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.330
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
And he built me up, you know?

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
And this is just an illustration.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
You can meet other individuals here.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.330
We just need a push.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.330
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:25.330
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.330
of us having to leave the continent

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
so that we can fulfill our potential.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
You know, my vision is that my daughter,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.330
and any other African child being born today,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
can be whoever they want to be here,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.330
without having to leave.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.330
And they can have the possibility of transcending

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
the circumstances under which they were born.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.330
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
and you can move.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.330
that doesn't define who you are.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:15.330
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
and the circumstances under which you were born,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
determine the rest of your life.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
I would like to see that change,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
and the change starts with us.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.330
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.330
Thank you.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
(Applause)
