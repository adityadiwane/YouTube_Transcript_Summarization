00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So, these are

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the Dark Ages.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And the Dark Ages are the time between

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
when you put away the Lego

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
for the last time as a kid,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Started out with my then four-year-old:

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
"Oh, should buy the kid some Lego.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
That stuff's cool."

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Walked into the Lego store.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Bought him this.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
(Laughter)

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I think the box says --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
let's see here --

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
"8 to 12" on it.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
The dining room looked like this.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
You walk there, and it hurts.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So we took a room downstairs in the basement

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260
(Laughter)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Torture, very funny.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Wow, you guys are great.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And we put down those little floor tiles,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and then I went onto eBay

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and bought 150 pounds of Lego --

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
(Laughter)

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
which is insane.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and I said,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
"Honey, you're my treasure."

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And she said, "No, the Lego is the treasure."

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
(Laughter)

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And then she said, "Dad, we're Lego rich."

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I was like, "Yeah.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I suppose we are."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So then once you do that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So you go to The Container Store

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and spend an enormous amount of money,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and then you start this crazy sorting process

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
that never --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
it's just nuts.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Whatever.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
So then you realize there are these conventions.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And you're like, "Holy shit!

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
He had to come in like a truck,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
a semi, with this thing."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Just beautiful.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And there's a dude selling these

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
aftermarket weapons for Lego,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
because Lego -- the Danish --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
no, they're not into guns.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for Lego, no problem.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And at a certain point, you look around,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
but that's like a couple of levels above furries.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
(Laughter)

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
The nerds here, they get laid --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and you say to yourself at some point,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I'm coming out.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
So then you really get into it,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this software

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
to let you build your own virtually."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And then whatever you design virtually,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And then some of the designs that people do

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
they actually sell in the store.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
The Lego guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
but some user made this and then it sold.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And it's pretty amazing actually.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Then you notice that if that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
there's an entire open-source, third-party,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
independent Lego CAD program

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that lets you do 3D modeling

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and 3D rendering

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and make, in fact, movies out of Lego,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
3D films

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
of which there are thousands on YouTube,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and some of them sort of mimicking famous films

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and some totally original content --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
just beautiful --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and people recreating all sorts of things.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I have to take a moment.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I love the guy who's like running away

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
with his clasps, his hooks.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Okay. Anyway.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
(Laughter)

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
There's a whole programming language and robotics tool,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
so if you want to teach someone how to program,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
kid, adult, whatever it is.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And the guy that made this,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
he made a slot machine out of Lego.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine;

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
The insides were Lego.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
There's people getting drunk building Lego,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
There's a whole gray market for Lego,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
thousands of home-based businesses.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And some people will fund their entire Lego habit

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
by selling the little guy,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
but then you have no guys in your ships.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
This is amazing what you can do.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And don't kid yourself:

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
some architectural details, incredible organic shapes

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
This is my house.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And this is my house.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
as I was taking a picture for you guys.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Anyway, I'm out of time.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
But just very quickly --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
we'll just see if I can do this quick.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Laughter)

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Let's see here.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Okay.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Ta-da.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
(Applause)
