00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.196
For several years now,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.340
we've been engaged in a national debate
about sexual assault on campus.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.196
No question --

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
it's crucial that young people
understand the ground rules for consent,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180
but that's where the conversation
about sex is ending.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.916
And in that vacuum of information

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.916
the media and the Internet --

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.676
that new digital street corner --

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.980
are educating our kids for us.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.156
If we truly want young people
to engage safely, ethically,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.876
and yes, enjoyably,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.660
it's time to have open honest discussion
about what happens after "yes,"

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.676
and that includes breaking
the biggest taboo of all

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.436
and talking to young people

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.860
about women's capacity for
and entitlement to sexual pleasure.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.476
Yeah.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.516
(Applause)

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.756
Come on, ladies.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.676
(Applause)

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.516
I spent three years
talking to girls ages 15 to 20

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.476
about their attitudes
and experience of sex.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.916
And what I found was

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.236
that while young women may feel
entitled to engage in sexual behavior,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.340
they don't necessarily
feel entitled to enjoy it.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.196
Take this sophomore
at the Ivy League college

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.436
who told me,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.716
"I come from a long line
of smart, strong women.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.956
My grandmother was a firecracker,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.836
my mom is a professional,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.220
my sister and I are loud,
and that's our form of feminine power."

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.876
She then proceeded
to describe her sex life to me:

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.956
a series of one-off hookups,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.716
starting when she was 13,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.196
that were ...

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.316
not especially responsible,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.476
not especially reciprocal

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.980
and not especially enjoyable.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.516
She shrugged.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.156
"I guess we girls are just socialized
to be these docile creatures

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.420
who don't express our wants or needs."

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.956
"Wait a minute," I replied.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.060
"Didn't you just tell me
what a smart, strong woman you are?"

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.220
She hemmed and hawed.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.716
"I guess," she finally said,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.260
"no one told me that that smart,
strong image applies to sex."

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.715
I should probably say right up top
that despite the hype,

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.636
teenagers are not engaging in intercourse
more often or at a younger age

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.876
than they were 25 years ago.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.556
They are, however,
engaging in other behavior.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.156
And when we ignore that,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.660
when we label that as "not sex,"

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.860
that opens the door
to risky behavior and disrespect.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.396
That's particularly true of oral sex,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.316
which teenagers consider
to be less intimate than intercourse.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.236
Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal,"

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.316
like they'd all read
the same instruction manual --

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.340
at least if boys
were on the receiving end.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.276
Young women have lots
of reasons for participating.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.996
It made them feel desired;

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.596
it was a way to boost social status.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.700
Sometimes, it was a way
to get out of an uncomfortable situation.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.436
As a freshman at a West Coast
college said to me,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.196
"A girl will give a guy a blow job
at the end of the night

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.396
because she doesn't
want to have sex with him,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.516
and he expects to be satisfied.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.396
So, if I want him to leave

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.373
and I don't want anything to happen ... "

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.676
I heard so many stories
of girls performing one-sided oral sex

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.716
that I started asking,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.996
"What if every time
you were alone with a guy,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.996
he told you to get him
a glass of water from the kitchen,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.356
and he never got you a glass of water --

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.860
or if he did, it was like ...

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.900
'you want me to uh ...?'"

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.140
You know, totally begrudging.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.780
You wouldn't stand for it.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.396
But it wasn't always
that boys didn't want to.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.076
It was that girls didn't want them to.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.276
Girls expressed a sense of shame
around their genitals.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.060
A sense that they were
simultaneously icky and sacred.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.956
Women's feelings about their genitals

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.100
have been directly linked
to their enjoyment of sex.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.516
Yet, Debby Herbenick,
a researcher at Indiana University,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.116
believes that girls' genital
self-image is under siege,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.796
with more pressure than ever

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.340
to see them as unacceptable
in their natural state.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.596
According to research,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.036
about three-quarters of college women
remove their pubic hair -- all of it --

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.716
at least on occasion,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.020
and more than half do so regularly.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.156
Girls would tell me that hair removal
made them feel cleaner,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.020
that it was a personal choice.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.876
Though, I kind of wondered
if left alone on a desert island,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.916
if this was how they would
choose to spend their time.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.476
(Laughter)

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.916
And when I pushed further,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.076
a darker motivation emerged:

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.820
avoiding humiliation.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.596
"Guys act like they
would be disgusted by it,"

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.060
one young woman told me.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.780
"No one wants to be
talked about like that."

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.476
The rising pubic hair removal
reminded me of the 1920s,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.996
when women first started regularly
shaving their armpits and their legs.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.556
That's when flapper dresses
came into style,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.156
and women's limbs were suddenly visible,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.620
open to public scrutiny.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.436
There's a way that I think
that this too is a sign.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.420
That a girl's most intimate part
is open to public scrutiny,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.956
open to critique,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.476
to becoming more about
how it looks to someone else

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.580
than how it feels to her.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.540
The shaving trend has sparked
another rise in labiaplasty.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.380
Labiaplasty, which is the trimming
of the inner and outer labia,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.340
is the fastest-growing cosmetic
surgery among teenage girls.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.676
It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.716
and whereas girls under 18 comprise
two percent of all cosmetic surgeries,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
they are five percent of labiaplasty.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.716
The most sought-after look, incidentally,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.476
in which the outer labia
appear fused like a clam shell,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.956
is called ...

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.180
wait for it ...

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.636
"The Barbie."

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.956
(Groan)

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.996
I trust I don't have to tell you

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.916
that Barbie is a) made of plastic

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.116
and b) has no genitalia.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.036
(Laughter)

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.836
The labiaplasty trend
has become so worrisome

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.516
that the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.796
has issued a statement on the procedure,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.316
which is rarely medically indicated,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.476
has not been proven safe

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.356
and whose side effects
include scarring, numbness, pain

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.340
and diminished sexual sensation.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.796
Now, admittedly,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.396
and blessedly,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.180
the number of girls involved
is still quite small,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.076
but you could see them
as canaries in a coal mine,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.100
telling us something important
about the way girls see their bodies.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.276
Sara McClelland,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.756
a psychologist
at the University of Michigan,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.300
coined what is my favorite phrase ever
in talking about all of this:

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.020
"Intimate justice."

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.596
That's the idea that sex has political,
as well as personal implications,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.276
just like, who does
the dishes in your house,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.900
or who vacuums the rug.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.316
And it raises similar
issues about inequality,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.316
about economic disparity,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.556
violence,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.020
physical and mental health.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.396
Intimate justice asks us to consider

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.756
who is entitled
to engage in an experience.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.276
Who is entitled to enjoy it?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.500
Who is the primary beneficiary?

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.340
And how does each partner
define "good enough"?

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.236
Honestly, I think those questions
are tricky and sometimes traumatic

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.740
for adult women to confront,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.116
but when we're talking about girls,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.436
I just kept coming back to the idea
that their early sexual experience

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.220
shouldn't have to be
something that they get over.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.596
In her work,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.436
McClelland found that young women
were more likely than young men

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.340
to use their partner's pleasure
as a measure of their satisfaction.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.276
So they'd say things like,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.116
"If he's sexually satisfied,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.700
then I'm sexually satisfied."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.100
Young men were more likely to measure
their satisfaction by their own orgasm.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.180
Young women also defined
bad sex differently.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.236
In the largest ever survey

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.396
ever conducted
on American sexual behavior,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.196
they reported pain
in their sexual encounters

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.100
30 percent of the time.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.180
They also used words like "depressing,"

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.516
"humiliating,"

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.740
"degrading."

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.340
The young men never used that language.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.636
So when young women
report sexual satisfaction levels

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.580
that are equal to
or greater than young men's --

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.500
and they do in research --

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.660
that can be deceptive.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.076
If a girl goes into an encounter
hoping that it won't hurt,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.116
wanting to feel close to her partner

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.180
and expecting him to have an orgasm,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.340
she'll be satisfied
if those criteria are met.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.196
And there's nothing wrong with wanting
to feel close to your partner,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.556
or wanting him to be happy,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.104
and orgasm isn't the only
measure of an experience ...

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.620
but absence of pain --

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.100
that's a very low bar
for your own sexual fulfillment.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.036
Listening to all of this
and thinking about it,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.356
I began to realize that we performed
a kind of psychological clitoridectomy

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.620
on American girls.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.476
Starting in infancy,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.316
parents of baby boys are more likely
to name all their body parts,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.420
at least they'll say,
"here's your pee-pee."

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.276
Parents of baby girls
go right from navel to knees,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.756
and they leave this whole
situation in here unnamed.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.116
(Laughter)

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.596
There's no better way
to make something unspeakable

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.820
than not to name it.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.516
Then kids go into
their puberty education classes

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.620
and they learn that boys
have erections and ejaculations,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.156
and girls have ...

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.100
periods and unwanted pregnancy.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.716
And they see that internal diagram
of a woman's reproductive system --

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.436
you know, the one that looks
kind of like a steer head --

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.940
(Laughter)

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.860
And it always grays out between the legs.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.756
So we never say vulva,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.156
we certainly never say clitoris.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.396
No surprise,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.556
fewer than half
of teenage girls age 14 to 17

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.580
have ever masturbated.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.996
And then they go
into their partnered experience

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.716
and we expect that somehow
they'll think sex is about them,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.420
that they'll be able to articulate
their needs, their desires, their limits.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.740
It's unrealistic.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.460
Here's something, though.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.316
Girls' investment
in their partner's pleasure remains

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.780
regardless of the gender of the partner.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.756
So in same-sex encounters,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.260
the orgasm gap disappears.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.780
And young women climax
at the same rate as men.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.116
Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.716
that they felt liberated
to get off the script --

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.156
free to create an encounter
that worked for them.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.836
Gay girls also challenged
the idea of first intercourse

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.796
as the definition of virginity.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.396
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.796
but it's worth questioning
why we consider this one act,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.636
which most girls associate
with discomfort or pain,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.156
to be the line in the sand
of sexual adulthood --

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.636
so much more meaningful,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.420
so much more transformative
than anything else.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.916
And it's worth considering
how this is serving girls;

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.956
whether it's keeping them
safer from disease,

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.860
coercion, betrayal, assault.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.460
Whether it's encouraging
mutuality and caring;

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.796
what it means about the way
they see other sex acts;

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.036
whether it's giving them more control over

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.900
and joy in their experience,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.436
and what it means about gay teens,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.500
who can have multiple sex partners
without heterosexual intercourse.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.620
So I asked a gay girl that I met,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.500
"How'd you know
you weren't a virgin anymore?"

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.836
She said she had to Google it.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.036
(Laughter)

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.620
And Google wasn't sure.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.836
(Laughter)

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.796
She finally decided
that she wasn't a virgin anymore

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.540
after she'd had
her first orgasm with a partner.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.356
And I thought --

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.580
whoa.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.596
What if just for a second

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.980
we imagined that was the definition?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.716
Again, not because
intercourse isn't a big deal --

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.036
of course it is --

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.380
but it isn't the only big deal,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.956
and rather than thinking about sex
as a race to a goal,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.076
this helps us reconceptualize it
as a pool of experiences

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.716
that include warmth, affection, arousal,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.540
desire, touch, intimacy.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.676
And it's worth asking young people:

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.236
who's really the more sexually
experienced person?

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.316
The one who makes out
with a partner for three hours

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.916
and experiments with sensual
tension and communication,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.756
or the one who gets wasted at a party
and hooks up with a random

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.460
in order to dump their "virginity"
before they get to college?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.636
The only way that shift
in thinking can happen though

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.716
is if we talk to young people
more about sex --

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.076
if we normalize those discussions,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.996
integrating them into everyday life,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.556
talking about those intimate acts
in a different way --

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.356
the way we mostly have changed

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.020
in the way that we talk
about women in the public realm.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.116
Consider a survey
of 300 randomly chosen girls

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.516
from a Dutch and an American university,

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.276
two similar universities,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.220
talking about their early
experience of sex.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.036
The Dutch girls embodied everything
we say we want from our girls.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.996
They had fewer negative consequences,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.860
like disease, pregnancy, regret --

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.236
more positive outcomes

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.676
like being able to communicate
with their partner,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.396
who they said they knew very well;

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.996
preparing for the experience responsibly;

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.580
enjoying themselves.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.700
What was their secret?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.796
The Dutch girls said
that their doctors, teachers and parents

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.436
talked to them candidly,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.196
from an early age,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.140
about sex, pleasure
and the importance of mutual trust.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.516
What's more,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:59.316
while American parents weren't necessarily
less comfortable talking about sex,

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.836
we tend to frame those conversations

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.460
entirely in terms or risk and danger,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.100
whereas Dutch parents talk
about balancing responsibility and joy.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.236
I have to tell you,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.116
as a parent myself,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.196
that hit me hard,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.756
because I know,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.036
had I not delved into that research,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.836
I would have talked to my own child
about contraception,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.716
about disease protection,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.476
about consent because I'm a modern parent,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.834
and I would have thought ...

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.020
job well done.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.420
Now I know that's not enough.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.780
I also know what I hope for for our girls.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.036
I want them to see sexuality
as a source of self-knowledge,

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.276
creativity and communication,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.916
despite its potential risks.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.396
I want them to be able
to revel in their bodies' sensuality

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.940
without being reduced to it.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.156
I want them to be able
to ask for what they want in bed,

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.420
and to get it.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.836
I want them to be safe
from unwanted pregnancy,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.076
disease,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.316
cruelty,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.916
dehumanization,

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.140
violence.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.676
If they are assaulted,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.156
I want them to have recourse
from their schools,

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.596
their employers,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.820
the courts.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.340
It's a lot to ask,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.260
but it's not too much.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.356
As parents, teachers,
advocates and activists,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.156
we have raised a generation
of girls to have a voice,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.036
to expect egalitarian
treatment in the home,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.316
in the classroom,

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.540
in the workplace.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.196
Now it's time to demand
that intimate justice

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.380
in their personal lives as well.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.796
Thank you.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.420
(Applause)
