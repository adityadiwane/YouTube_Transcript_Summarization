00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:29.700
I'm not quite sure whether
I really want to see a snare drum

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:31.796
at nine o'clock or so in the morning.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.218
(Laughter)

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:37.312
But anyway, it's just great
to see such a full theater,

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.621
and really, I must thank
Herbie Hancock and his colleagues

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:43.149
for such a great presentation.

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:46.244
(Applause)

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:48.454
One of the interesting things, of course,

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:55.431
is the combination of that raw hand
on the instrument and technology,

00:00:55.911 --> 00:01:00.551
and what he said about listening
to our young people.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:04.273
Of course, my job is all about listening.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:11.039
And my aim, really,
is to teach the world to listen.

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:14.648
That's my only real aim in life.

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:21.531
And it sounds quite simple,
but actually, it's quite a big, big job.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:26.825
Because you know, when you look
at a piece of music, for example,

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.308
if I just open my little motorbike bag --

00:01:31.647 --> 00:01:34.655
we have here, hopefully,

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.304
a piece of music that is full
of little black dots on the page.

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:45.260
And, you know, we open it up ...

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.006
And I read the music.

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:53.268
So technically, I can actually read this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.976
I will follow the instructions,
the tempo markings, the dynamics.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.771
I will do exactly as I'm told.

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:06.109
And so therefore, because time is short,

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:13.032
if I just played you, literally,
the first, maybe, two lines or so --

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:17.234
It's very straightforward; there's nothing
too difficult about the piece.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:20.566
But here, I'm being told
that the piece of music is very quick.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.556
I'm being told where to play on the drum.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.496
I'm being told which part
of the stick to use.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:31.445
And I'm being told the dynamic.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.070
And I'm also being told
that the drum is without snares.

00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:39.106
Snares on, snares off.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.982
So therefore, if I translate
this piece of music,

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.006
we have this idea.

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:50.278
(Drum sounds)

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:18.242
(Drum sounds end)

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:19.533
And so on.

00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:23.039
My career would probably last
about five years.

00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:24.067
(Laughter)

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.614
However, what I have to do as a musician

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:32.746
is do everything that is not on the music;

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.774
everything that there isn't time
to learn from a teacher,

00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:41.358
or to talk about, even, from a teacher.

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:46.235
But it's the things you notice when
you're not actually with your instrument

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:51.506
that, in fact, become so interesting,
and that you want to explore

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.998
through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:57.723
So there, we experience the translation.

00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:01.217
Now we'll experience the interpretation.

00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:03.852
(Drum sounds)

00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:45.976
(Drum sounds end)

00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:54.513
(Applause)

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.769
Now my career may last a little longer.

00:04:57.793 --> 00:04:59.120
(Laughter)

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:02.429
But in a way, you know,
it's the same if I look at you

00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:06.793
and I see a nice, bright young lady
with a pink top on.

00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:10.235
I see that you're clutching
a teddy bear, etc., etc.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.817
So I get a basic idea
as to what you might be about,

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:19.209
what you might like, what you might do
as a profession, etc., etc.

00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:26.003
However, that's just the initial idea
I may have that we all get

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:29.609
when we actually look
and we try to interpret.

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.933
But actually it's so unbelievably shallow.

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.862
In the same way, I look
at the music; I get a basic idea;

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:39.180
I wonder what technically might be hard,
or, you know, what I want to do.

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:40.694
Just the basic feeling.

00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:43.381
However, that is simply not enough.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:47.719
And I think what Herbie said:
please listen, listen.

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:51.379
We have to listen
to ourselves, first of all.

00:05:51.403 --> 00:05:55.148
If I play, for example,
holding the stick --

00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:58.225
where literally I do not let go
of the stick --

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.814
(Drum sound)

00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:04.655
you'll experience quite a lot
of shock coming up through the arm.

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.004
And you feel really quite --
believe it or not --

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:10.271
detached from the instrument
and from the stick,

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:14.417
even though I'm actually holding
the stick quite tightly.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.866
(Drum sound)

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.847
By holding it tightly,
I feel strangely more detached.

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.588
If I just simply let go

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:26.807
and allow my hand, my arm,
to be more of a support system,

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:28.029
suddenly --

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:30.067
(Drum sound)

00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:33.548
I have more dynamic with less effort.

00:06:33.572 --> 00:06:34.747
Much more --

00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:36.522
(Drum sound)

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:39.479
and I just feel, at last,
one with the stick

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:41.162
and one with the drum.

00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:43.299
And I'm doing far, far less.

00:06:43.323 --> 00:06:46.735
So in the same way that I need
time with this instrument,

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:52.086
I need time with people
in order to interpret them.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.798
Not just translate them,
but interpret them.

00:06:54.822 --> 00:07:01.009
If, for example, I play just
a few bars of a piece of music

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:07.679
for which I think of myself
as a technician --

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:11.959
that is, someone who is basically
a percussion player --

00:07:11.983 --> 00:07:14.229
(Marimba sounds)

00:07:22.973 --> 00:07:24.870
(Marimba sounds end)

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:28.082
And so on, if I think of myself
as a musician --

00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:30.174
(Marimba sounds)

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.910
(Marimba sounds end)

00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:51.108
And so on.

00:07:51.132 --> 00:07:54.994
There is a little bit of a difference
there that is worth just --

00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:57.569
(Applause)

00:07:57.593 --> 00:07:58.976
thinking about.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.909
And I remember when I was 12 years old,

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:06.051
and I started playing timpani
and percussion,

00:08:06.075 --> 00:08:08.505
and my teacher said,

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:14.182
"Well, how are we going to do this?
You know, music is about listening."

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:18.877
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that,
so what's the problem?"

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:21.320
And he said, "Well,
how are you going to hear this?

00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:22.902
How are you going to hear that?"

00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:25.008
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:28.976
He said, "Well, I think
I hear it through here."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.374
And I said, "Well, I think I do too,
but I also hear it through my hands,

00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:37.937
through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,

00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:40.978
my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:45.834
And so we began our lessons
every single time

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:49.800
tuning drums, in particular,
the kettle drums, or timpani

00:08:49.824 --> 00:08:54.837
to such a narrow pitch interval,
so something like --

00:08:55.606 --> 00:08:58.218
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.213
that of a difference.

00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:02.439
Then gradually:

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:03.620
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:04.824
And gradually:

00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:06.639
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:10.722
And it's amazing that when you do
open your body up,

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.721
and open your hand up to allow
the vibration to come through,

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:17.068
that in fact the tiny, tiny difference --

00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:19.151
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:25.257
can be felt with just the tiniest
part of your finger, there.

00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:28.147
And so what we would do
is that I would put my hands

00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:30.486
on the wall of the music room,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.704
and together, we would "listen"
to the sounds of the instruments,

00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:39.564
and really try to connect
with those sounds

00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:43.981
far, far more broadly
than simply depending on the ear.

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:48.648
Because of course, the ear
is subject to all sorts of things.

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.641
The room we happen to be in,
the amplification,

00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:54.400
the quality of the instrument,
the type of sticks --

00:09:54.424 --> 00:09:56.505
(Marimba sounds)

00:10:00.844 --> 00:10:02.791
(Marimba sounds end)

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:04.634
Etc., etc., they're all different.

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:06.658
(Marimba sounds)

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:11.214
(Marimba sounds end)

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:15.823
Same amount of weight,
but different sound colors.

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:18.751
And that's basically what we are;
we're just human beings,

00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:21.940
but we all have our own
little sound colors, as it were,

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:25.613
that make up these extraordinary
personalities and characters

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:27.510
and interests and things.

00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:30.534
And as I grew older, I then auditioned

00:10:30.558 --> 00:10:32.976
for the Royal Academy of Music in London,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.274
and they said, "Well, no, we won't
accept you, because we haven't a clue,

00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:41.951
you know, of the future
of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:46.502
And I just couldn't quite accept that.

00:10:46.526 --> 00:10:53.094
And so therefore, I said to them,
"Well, look, if you refuse --

00:10:53.118 --> 00:10:56.443
if you refuse me through those reasons,

00:10:56.467 --> 00:11:01.235
as opposed to the ability to perform

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:07.976
and to understand and love
the art of creating sound --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.239
then we have to think very, very hard
about the people you do actually accept."

00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:18.521
And as a result,
once we got over a little hurdle,

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.554
and having to audition twice,

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:22.793
they accepted me.

00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:24.183
And not only that,

00:11:24.207 --> 00:11:29.850
what had happened was that it changed
the whole role of the music institutions

00:11:29.874 --> 00:11:31.826
throughout the United Kingdom.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.798
Under no circumstances were they to refuse

00:11:35.822 --> 00:11:39.737
any application whatsoever

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:43.269
on the basis of whether someone
had no arms, no legs --

00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:47.821
they could still perhaps play a wind
instrument if it was supported on a stand.

00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:54.623
No circumstances at all
were used to refuse any entry.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:59.485
And every single entry
had to be listened to, experienced,

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:02.066
and then, based on the musical ability,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:07.342
then that person
could either enter or not.

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:10.520
And so therefore, this in turn meant

00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:14.181
that there was an extremely
interesting bunch of students

00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:17.555
who arrived in these various
music institutions,

00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:22.068
and I have to say, many of them now
in the professional orchestras

00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:24.071
throughout the world.

00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:26.781
The interesting thing
about this as well, though --

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:30.976
(Applause)

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.790
is quite simply that not only were people
connected with sound --

00:12:37.814 --> 00:12:39.325
which is basically all of us --

00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:44.271
we well know that music
really is our daily medicine.

00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.976
I say "music," but actually
I mean "sound."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.625
Because some of the extraordinary
things I've experienced as a musician --

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:55.788
when you may have a 15-year-old lad

00:12:55.812 --> 00:13:00.541
who has got the most
incredible challenges,

00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:03.302
who may not be able
to control his movements,

00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:06.339
who may be deaf,
who may be blind, etc., etc. --

00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:12.393
suddenly, if that young lad
sits close to this instrument,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.228
and perhaps even lies
underneath the marimba,

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:20.976
and you play something
that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.860
I don't really have
the right sticks, perhaps --

00:13:23.884 --> 00:13:27.707
but something like this --
let me change --

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.473
(Soft marimba sounds)

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:17.802
(Soft marimba sounds end)

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:20.708
Something that's so unbelievably simple --

00:14:20.732 --> 00:14:25.052
but he would be experiencing
something that I wouldn't be,

00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:27.494
because I'm on top of the sound.

00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:29.784
I have the sound coming this way.

00:14:29.808 --> 00:14:33.366
He would have the sound
coming through the resonators.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.525
If there were no resonators
on here, we would have:

00:14:36.894 --> 00:14:41.967
(Marimba sounds)

00:14:43.106 --> 00:14:45.425
So he would have a fullness of sound

00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:48.447
that those of you in the front few rows
wouldn't experience,

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.616
those of you in the back few rows
wouldn't experience, either.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.733
Every single one of us,
depending on where we're sitting,

00:14:54.757 --> 00:14:58.534
will experience this sound
quite, quite differently.

00:14:58.558 --> 00:15:01.428
And of course, being
the participator of the sound,

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:06.278
and that is, starting from the idea
of what type of sound

00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:09.587
I want to produce,
for example, this sound:

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(No sound)

00:15:16.171 --> 00:15:17.335
Can you hear anything?

00:15:19.108 --> 00:15:21.854
Exactly -- because
I'm not even touching it.

00:15:21.878 --> 00:15:23.403
(Laughter)

00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:28.054
But yet, we get the sensation
of something happening.

00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:30.637
In the same way
that when I see a tree moves,

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:34.879
then I imagine that tree
making a rustling sound.

00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:36.129
Do you see what I mean?

00:15:36.153 --> 00:15:40.270
Whatever the eye sees,
then there's always sound happening.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:44.489
So there's always, always that huge --

00:15:44.513 --> 00:15:48.799
I mean, just this kaleidoscope
of things to draw from.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:54.792
So all of my performances
are based on entirely what I experience,

00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:57.312
and not by learning a piece of music,

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.538
putting on someone else's
interpretation of it,

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:02.741
buying all the CDs possible
of that particular piece of music,

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:04.131
and so on and so forth,

00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:10.507
because that isn't giving me enough
of something that is so raw and so basic,

00:16:10.531 --> 00:16:15.658
and something that I can fully
experience the journey of.

00:16:15.682 --> 00:16:19.909
So it may be that, in certain halls,

00:16:19.933 --> 00:16:24.701
this dynamic may well work.

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:27.461
(Soft marimba sounds)

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.372
(Soft marimba sounds end)

00:16:34.396 --> 00:16:35.928
It may be that in other halls,

00:16:35.952 --> 00:16:39.187
they're simply not going
to experience that at all,

00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:43.419
and so therefore, my level of soft,
gentle playing may have to be --

00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:46.602
(Marimba sounds)

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.471
(Marimba sounds end)

00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:08.837
Do you see what I mean?

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:15.119
So, because of this explosion
in access to sound,

00:17:15.143 --> 00:17:17.654
especially through the Deaf community,

00:17:17.678 --> 00:17:22.105
this has not only affected
how music institutions,

00:17:22.129 --> 00:17:28.898
how schools for the deaf treat sound,
and not just as a means of therapy --

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.535
although, of course,
being a participator of music,

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.157
that definitely is the case as well --

00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:39.280
but it's meant that acousticians
have had to really think

00:17:39.304 --> 00:17:43.326
about the types of halls
they put together.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.814
There are so few halls in this world

00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:51.155
that actually have
very good acoustics, dare I say.

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:56.764
But by that I mean, where you can
absolutely do anything you imagine.

00:17:56.788 --> 00:18:01.606
The tiniest, softest, softest sound
to something that is so broad,

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.352
so huge, so incredible.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.770
There's always something:

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.298
it may sound good up there,
may not be so good there;

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:10.465
it may be great there,
but terrible up there;

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:14.673
maybe terrible over there,
but not too bad there, etc., etc.

00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:19.119
So to find an actual hall is incredible --

00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:23.219
for which you can play
exactly what you imagine,

00:18:23.243 --> 00:18:26.350
without it being cosmetically enhanced.

00:18:26.374 --> 00:18:31.431
So therefore, acousticians
are actually in conversation

00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:34.750
with people who are hearing impaired,

00:18:34.774 --> 00:18:39.625
and who are participators of sound.

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:41.476
And this is quite interesting.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.487
I cannot give you any detail

00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:49.248
as far as what is actually happening
with those halls,

00:18:49.272 --> 00:18:53.380
but it's just the fact
that they are going to a group of people

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:57.350
for whom so many years, we've been saying,

00:18:57.374 --> 00:19:00.715
"Well, how on earth can they experience
music? They're deaf."

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:04.054
We go like that, and we imagine
that's what deafness is about.

00:19:04.078 --> 00:19:07.214
Or we go like that, and we imagine
that's what blindness is about.

00:19:07.238 --> 00:19:11.060
If we see someone in a wheelchair,
we assume they cannot walk.

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:14.608
It may be that they can walk
three, four, five steps.

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:17.483
That, to them, means they can walk.

00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:21.633
In a year's time,
it could be two extra steps.

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:25.052
In another year's time, three extra steps.

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:29.779
Those are hugely important
aspects to think about.

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:33.976
So when we do listen to each other,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.689
it's unbelievably important for us

00:19:37.713 --> 00:19:42.331
to really test our listening skills,

00:19:42.355 --> 00:19:45.827
to really use our bodies
as a resonating chamber,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.500
to stop the judgment.

00:19:47.524 --> 00:19:51.395
For me, as a musician who deals
with 99 percent of new music,

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.343
it's very easy for me to say,

00:19:53.367 --> 00:19:56.968
"Oh yes, I like that piece.
No, I don't like that piece," and so on.

00:19:56.992 --> 00:20:02.121
And I just find that I have to give
those pieces of music real time.

00:20:02.145 --> 00:20:05.418
It may be that the chemistry
isn't quite right between myself

00:20:05.442 --> 00:20:07.219
and that particular piece of music,

00:20:07.243 --> 00:20:11.725
but that doesn't mean I have the right
to say it's a bad piece of music.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:17.177
And you know, one of the great things
about being a musician

00:20:17.201 --> 00:20:20.757
is that it is so unbelievably fluid.

00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:25.185
So there are no rules, no right,
no wrong, this way, that way.

00:20:25.209 --> 00:20:30.037
If I asked you to clap --
maybe I can do this.

00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:36.435
If I can just say, "Please clap
and create the sound of thunder."

00:20:36.459 --> 00:20:39.758
I'm assuming we've all
experienced thunder.

00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:41.364
Now, I don't mean just the sound;

00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:46.305
I mean really listen
to that thunder within yourselves.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.787
And please try to create that
through your clapping.

00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:50.760
Try, just -- please try.

00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:54.053
(Loud clapping sounds)

00:20:58.561 --> 00:20:59.711
(Clapping ends)

00:21:00.103 --> 00:21:01.461
Snow.

00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:03.621
(Laughter)

00:21:03.645 --> 00:21:04.813
Snow.

00:21:04.837 --> 00:21:07.073
(Soft clapping sounds)

00:21:07.097 --> 00:21:08.642
Have you ever heard snow?

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:09.817
Audience: No.

00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:11.999
Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.

00:21:12.023 --> 00:21:13.422
(Laughter)

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:16.651
Try again. Try again: snow.

00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:20.060
(No sound)

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.426
See, you're awake.

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:24.342
Rain.

00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:26.403
(Light clapping sounds)

00:21:26.887 --> 00:21:28.340
EG: (Laughs)

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:32.084
Not bad. Not bad.

00:21:32.108 --> 00:21:36.864
The interesting thing here, though,
is that I asked a group of kids

00:21:36.888 --> 00:21:38.591
not so long ago

00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:40.780
exactly the same question.

00:21:40.804 --> 00:21:44.183
Now -- great imagination,
thank you very much.

00:21:44.207 --> 00:21:47.029
However, not one of you got out
of your seats to think,

00:21:47.053 --> 00:21:48.720
"Right! How can I clap?

00:21:48.744 --> 00:21:49.966
OK, maybe:

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.499
(Clapping sounds)

00:21:52.523 --> 00:21:55.355
Maybe I can use my jewelry
to create extra sounds.

00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:59.415
Maybe I can use the other parts
of my body to create extra sounds."

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:04.832
Not a single one of you thought
about clapping in a slightly different way

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:07.974
other than sitting in your seats
there and using two hands.

00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:10.143
In the same way, when we listen to music,

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:14.108
we assume that it's all being
fed through here.

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:16.676
This is how we experience music.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.371
Of course, it's not.

00:22:18.395 --> 00:22:21.218
We experience thunder, thunder, thunder.

00:22:21.242 --> 00:22:22.439
Think, think, think.

00:22:22.463 --> 00:22:24.353
Listen, listen, listen.

00:22:24.852 --> 00:22:28.599
Now, what can we do with thunder?

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:34.660
I remember my teacher, when I first
started, my very first lesson,

00:22:34.684 --> 00:22:38.069
I was all prepared
with sticks, ready to go.

00:22:38.093 --> 00:22:42.889
And instead of him saying,
"OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,

00:22:42.913 --> 00:22:48.753
arms at a more or less 90-degree angle,
sticks in a more or less V shape,

00:22:48.777 --> 00:22:51.821
keep this amount of space here, etc.

00:22:51.845 --> 00:22:54.399
Please keep your back straight,
etc., etc., etc." --

00:22:54.423 --> 00:22:58.587
where I was just probably going to end up
absolutely rigid, frozen,

00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:00.620
and I would not be able to strike the drum

00:23:00.644 --> 00:23:02.864
because I was thinking
of so many other things,

00:23:02.888 --> 00:23:05.451
he said, "Evelyn, take this drum
away for seven days,

00:23:05.475 --> 00:23:07.260
and I'll see you next week."

00:23:07.284 --> 00:23:09.689
So -- heavens! What was I to do?

00:23:09.713 --> 00:23:12.191
I no longer required the sticks.

00:23:12.215 --> 00:23:14.363
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:18.024
I had to basically look
at this particular drum,

00:23:18.048 --> 00:23:19.721
see how it was made,

00:23:19.745 --> 00:23:22.761
what these little lugs did,
what the snares did.

00:23:22.785 --> 00:23:25.737
Turned it upside down,
experimented with the shell.

00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:27.474
(Drum sounds)

00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:28.844
Experimented with the head.

00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:30.330
(Drum sounds)

00:23:30.354 --> 00:23:32.134
Experimented with my body.

00:23:32.158 --> 00:23:33.952
(Drum sounds)

00:23:33.976 --> 00:23:35.800
Experimented with jewelry.

00:23:35.824 --> 00:23:37.912
Experimented with all sorts of things.

00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:41.315
(Drum sounds)

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.832
(Drum sounds end)

00:23:48.182 --> 00:23:51.382
And of course, I returned
with all sorts of bruises.

00:23:51.406 --> 00:23:52.657
(Laughter)

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:56.041
But nevertheless, it was such
an unbelievable experience,

00:23:56.065 --> 00:24:00.767
because where on earth are you going
to experience that in a piece of music?

00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:04.777
Where on earth are you going
to experience that in a study book?

00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:08.506
So we never, ever dealt
with actual study books.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.186
So for example,
one of the things that we learn

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.894
when we are dealing
with being a percussion player

00:24:15.918 --> 00:24:17.277
as opposed to a musician,

00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:20.906
is basically, straightforward
single-stroke rolls.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.554
(Drum sounds)

00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:26.688
Like that, and then
we get a little faster --

00:24:26.712 --> 00:24:27.880
(Drum sounds)

00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:29.100
and a little faster --

00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:30.302
(Drum sounds)

00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:32.808
and a little faster,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:32.832 --> 00:24:34.271
What does this piece require?

00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:35.670
Single-stroke rolls.

00:24:35.694 --> 00:24:38.893
(Drum sound)

00:24:38.917 --> 00:24:42.379
So why can't I then do that
whilst learning a piece of music?

00:24:42.403 --> 00:24:45.221
And that's exactly what he did.

00:24:45.245 --> 00:24:50.595
And interestingly, the older I became,
and when I became a full-time student

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:55.877
at a so-called "music institution,"
all of that went out of the window.

00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:58.642
We had to study from study books.

00:24:58.666 --> 00:25:02.767
And constantly, the question, "Well, why?
Why? What is this relating to?

00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:04.391
I need to play a piece of music."

00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:06.172
"Well, this will help your control."

00:25:06.196 --> 00:25:08.755
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:11.284
I need to relate it to a piece of music.

00:25:11.308 --> 00:25:13.870
You know, I need to say something.

00:25:13.894 --> 00:25:16.000
Why am I practicing paradiddles?

00:25:16.024 --> 00:25:20.006
(Drum sounds)

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.897
Is it just literally for control,
for hand-stick control?

00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:25.305
Why am I doing that?

00:25:25.329 --> 00:25:27.729
I need to have the reason,

00:25:27.753 --> 00:25:33.334
and the reason has to be by saying
something through the music."

00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:37.851
And by saying something through music,
which basically is sound,

00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:42.247
we then can reach all sorts
of things to all sorts of people.

00:25:42.271 --> 00:25:46.520
But I don't want to take responsibility
of your emotional baggage.

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.768
That's up to you,
when you walk through a hall,

00:25:48.792 --> 00:25:54.126
because that then determines
what and how we listen to certain things.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:59.431
I may feel sorrowful, or happy,
or exhilarated, or angry

00:25:59.455 --> 00:26:01.243
when I play certain pieces of music,

00:26:01.267 --> 00:26:06.144
but I'm not necessarily wanting you
to feel exactly the same thing.

00:26:06.168 --> 00:26:09.272
So please, the next time
you go to a concert,

00:26:09.296 --> 00:26:12.941
just allow your body to open up,

00:26:12.965 --> 00:26:16.047
allow your body to be
this resonating chamber.

00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:19.348
Be aware that you're not going
to experience the same thing

00:26:19.372 --> 00:26:21.078
as the performer is.

00:26:21.102 --> 00:26:24.842
The performer is in the worst possible
position for the actual sound,

00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:28.422
because they're hearing
the contact of the stick --

00:26:28.446 --> 00:26:29.958
(Drum sound)

00:26:29.982 --> 00:26:32.851
on the drum, or the mallet
on the bit of wood,

00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:35.062
or the bow on the string, etc.,

00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:39.224
or the breath that's creating
the sound from wind and brass.

00:26:39.248 --> 00:26:41.769
They're experiencing that rawness there.

00:26:41.793 --> 00:26:45.641
But yet they're experiencing
something so unbelievably pure,

00:26:45.665 --> 00:26:49.495
which is before the sound
is actually happening.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:56.075
Please take note of the life of the sound
after the actual initial strike,

00:26:56.099 --> 00:26:58.504
or breath, is being pulled.

00:26:58.528 --> 00:27:02.776
Just experience the whole
journey of that sound

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.398
in the same way that I wished
I'd experienced the whole journey

00:27:06.422 --> 00:27:10.851
of this particular conference,
rather than just arriving last night.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:15.532
But I hope maybe we can share
one or two things as the day progresses.

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:18.295
But thank you very much for having me!

00:27:18.319 --> 00:27:21.553
(Applause)

00:27:24.262 --> 00:27:25.960
(Applause ends)

00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:40.979
(Music)

00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:04.901
(Music ends)

00:32:08.244 --> 00:32:15.244
(Applause)
