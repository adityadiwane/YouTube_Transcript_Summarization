00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Space,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
we all know what it looks like.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We've been surrounded by images of space

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
our whole lives,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
from the speculative images

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
of science fiction

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to the inspirational visions of artists

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to the increasingly beautiful pictures

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
made possible by complex technologies.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
But whilst we have

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
an overwhelmingly vivid

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
visual understanding of space,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
we have no sense of what space sounds like.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And indeed, most people associate space with silence.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But the story of how

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
we came to understand the universe

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
is just as much a story of listening

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
as it is by looking.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And yet despite this,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
hardly any of us have ever heard space.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
How many of you here

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
could describe the sound

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
of a single planet or star?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Well in case you've ever wondered,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
this is what the Sun sounds like.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:33.260
(Static)

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
(Crackling)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.260
(Static)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
(Crackling)

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
This is the planet Jupiter.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Soft crackling)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And this is the space probe Cassini

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:37.260
(Crackling)

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
This is a a highly condensed clump

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
of neutral matter,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
spinning in the distant universe.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Tapping)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So my artistic practice

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
is all about listening

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
to the weird and wonderful noises

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
emitted by the magnificent celestial objects

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that make up our universe.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And you may wonder,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
how do we know what these sounds are?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
How can we tell the difference

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
between the sound of the Sun

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and the sound of a pulsar?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Well the answer

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
is the science of radio astronomy.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Radio astronomers

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
study radio waves from space

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
using sensitive antennas and receivers,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
which give them precise information

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
about what an astronomical object is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and where it is in our night sky.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And just like the signals

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that we send and receive here on Earth,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
we can convert these transmissions into sound

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
using simple analog techniques.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And therefore, it's through listening

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that we've come to uncover

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
some of the universe's most important secrets --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
its scale, what it's made of

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and even how old it is.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
of the history of the universe through listening.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It's punctuated

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
by three quick anecdotes,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
which show how accidental encounters

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
with strange noises

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
gave us some of the most important information

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
we have about space.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Now this story doesn't start

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
with vast telescopes

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
or futuristic spacecraft,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
but a rather more humble technology --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and in fact, the very medium

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
which gave us the telecommunications revolution

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that we're all part of today:

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
the telephone.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
It's 1876, it's in Boston,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and this is Alexander Graham Bell

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
who was working with Thomas Watson

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
on the invention of the telephone.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
A key part of their technical set up

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
was a half-mile long length of wire,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
which was thrown across the rooftops

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
of several houses in Boston.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
The line carried the telephone signals

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that would later make Bell a household name.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But like any long length of charged wire,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
it also inadvertently became

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
an antenna.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Thomas Watson

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
spent hours listening

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
to the strange crackles and hisses

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and chirps and whistles

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
that his accidental antenna detected.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Now you have to remember,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
this is 10 years before

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit --

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
We didn't have the technology

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
to transmit.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So what were these strange noises?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Watson was in fact listening

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
to very low-frequency radio emissions

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
caused by nature.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
but the eerie whistles

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and curiously melodious chirps

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
had a rather more exotic origin.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Using the very first telephone,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Watson was in fact

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
dialed into the heavens.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
As he correctly guessed,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
some of these sounds were caused

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
by activity on the surface of the Sun.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It was a solar wind

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
interacting with our ionosphere

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that he was listening to --

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
a phenomena which we can see

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
as the aurora.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So whilst inventing the technology

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
that would usher in the telecommunications revolution,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Watson had discovered

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that the star at the center of our solar system

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
emitted powerful radio waves.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
He had accidentally been the first person

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to tune in to them.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Fast-forward 50 years,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and Bell and Watson's technology

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
has completely transformed

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
global communications.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
But going from slinging some wire

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
across rooftops in Boston

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
on the Atlantic Ocean seabed

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
is no easy matter.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And so before long,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Bell were looking to new technologies

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
to optimize their revolution.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Radio could carry sound without wires.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
But the medium is lossy --

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.260
it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
So Bell employed an engineer

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to study those noises,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
to try and find out where they came from,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
with a view towards building

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
so they could think about using radio

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
for the purposes of telephony.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Most of the noises

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
were fairly prosaic in origin.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
They turned out to be lightning

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
or sources of electrical power.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But there was one persistent noise

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
that Jansky couldn't identify,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and it seemed to appear

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
in his radio headset

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
four minutes earlier each day.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Now any astronomer will tell you,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
this is the telltale sign

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
of something that doesn't originate from Earth.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Jansky had made a historic discovery,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
that celestial objects could emit radio waves

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
as well as light waves.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Fifty years on

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Jansky's careful listening

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
ushered in a new age of space exploration:

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
the radio astronomy age.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Over the next few years,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and learned about our radio sky,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
about Jupiter and the Sun,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
by listening.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Let's jump ahead again.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It's 1964,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and we're back at Bell Labs.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And once again,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
two scientists have got a problem with noise.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
were using the horn antenna

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
at Bell's Holmdel laboratory

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
to study the Milky Way

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
with extraordinary precision.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
They were really listening

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
to the galaxy in high fidelity.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
A mysterious persistent noise

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
was disrupting their research.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
It was in the microwave range,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and it appeared to be coming

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
from all directions simultaneously.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Now this didn't make any sense,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
it must be the dish.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
There were pigeons roosting in the dish.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
get the disk kind of operational again,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
normal operations would resume.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
But the noise didn't disappear.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
The mysterious noise

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that Penzias and Wilson were listening to

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that anyone had ever heard.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
It was cosmic radiation

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.260
left over from the very birth of the universe.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
This was the first experimental evidence

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
that the Big Bang existed

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and the universe was born at a precise moment

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
some 14.7 billion years ago.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So our story ends

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
at the beginning --

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
the cosmic microwave background radiation

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
left over from the Big Bang.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:11:04.260
(Fuzz)

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Thanks.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
(Applause)
