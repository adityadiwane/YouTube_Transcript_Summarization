00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this is a pretty well-educated audience,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that has had success in combating the epidemic.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So today I'm going to talk about some things

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that you might not know about the epidemic,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and I'm actually also going to challenge

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
some of these things that you think that you do know.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
To do that I'm going to talk about my research

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as an economist on the epidemic.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to think about a problem that's more traditionally

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
part of public health and epidemiology.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to think about problems of another.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is really the most important,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that we actually cannot develop effective policy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
unless we really understand how the epidemic works.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And the first thing that I want to talk about,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the first thing I think we need to understand is:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
how do people respond to the epidemic?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
there's a really significant cost of sex.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That is a huge effect.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And in fact among gay men in the US

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's a huge change in a very short period of time.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We didn't see anything like that in Africa.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the share of single men having pre-marital sex,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
or married men having extra-marital sex,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
People are learning more things about it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We see almost no change in sexual behavior.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and that to understand this you need to think about health

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the way than an economist does -- as an investment.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
whether to add some new functionality to your program,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
it's important to think about how much it costs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It's also important to think about what the benefit is.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And one part of that benefit is how much longer

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you think this program is going to be active.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
If version 10 is coming out next week,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But your health decisions are the same.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that's a costly investment in your health.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But how much you want to invest is going to depend

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on how much longer you expect to live in the future,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
even if you don't make those investments.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
People really like to have sex.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
40 or 50 years in a lot of places.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But we really need to test that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And the way that I'm going to do that is,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So malaria is a disease that kills you.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So one way to test to see whether we can explain

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is to look and see is there more behavior change

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in areas where there's less malaria.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So that's what this figure shows you.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
If you look at the blue line,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
as HIV prevalence goes up.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is not just through malaria.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
change their behavior less in response to HIV

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But it also tells us something about policy.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in combating poor indoor air quality,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
in improving maternal mortality rates.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Because if you improve those things,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
may not be enough, at least not alone.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
even if they know everything about the disease,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
they still may not change their behavior.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
People aren't changing their behavior enough

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to decrease the growth in the epidemic.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So we're going to need to think about policy

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and what kind of policies might be effective.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It's not the only place we had any interventions.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and see what happened to their prevalence?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You get on Google, you Google, and you find,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
are STD patients and pregnant women,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
which is not a terribly representative group of people.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
some years it's only pregnant women.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We have no consistent testing.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's been testing in random samples of the population.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It kills people in the prime of their lives.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So it turns out, if you use this technique,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
actually your estimates of prevalence are very close

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to what we get from testing random samples in the population,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and prevalence based on the mortality data

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You can see, almost without exception,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So this is another way to see this.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
about how we can use this kind of information to learn something

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that's going to help us think about the world.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But this also tells us that one of these facts

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
If you think that 25 million people are infected,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
When I started working on these projects,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I was not thinking at all about economics,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So I am going to talk about exports and prices.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in particular export volume, and HIV infections.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
with the fact that development, that openness to trade,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
is really good for developing countries.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's good for improving people's lives.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and I wouldn't be at all worried about that

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
if we never had any contact with Asia.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The epidemic was introduced to the US

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
by actually one male steward on an airline flight,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Areas with a lot of economic activity --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
those areas have higher prevalence than others.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But that actually doesn't mean at all

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that these things are positively related.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
or other policies that encourage trade,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
if we know there's this externality --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that improving exports and improving development --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to a decline in HIV prevalence.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the special case of Uganda, and the fact that

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's been widely heralded.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But now I want to actually also question that.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
There was a big decline in coffee prices.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Coffee is Uganda's major export.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So you can see that both of these series --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
you can see they're both increasing.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And then actually they track each other

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a little bit on the increase later in the decade.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So if you combine the intuition in this figure

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
with some of the data that I talked about before,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
of the decline in prevalence in Uganda

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
actually would have happened even without any education campaign.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But that's enormously important for policy.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
then there are all sorts of other things

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
maybe we should be spending our money on instead.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
some of the things that you did know.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that it's important to understand things about the epidemic

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in order to think about policy.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And when I leave here, I'm going to go back

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And the thing that's most exciting about that

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
is every time I think about research, there are more questions.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
There are more things that I think that I want to do.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And what's really, really great about being here

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So thank you very much.
