00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Today I want to talk to you about

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
swimming across the North Pole,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
across the most northern place in the whole world.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
He was a great storyteller.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
He could tell a story about an event,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
was of the first British atomic bomb test.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
He had been there and watched it go off.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
And he said that the explosion was so loud

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and the light was so intense,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
of his fingers,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
because the light was so bright.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
had a very, very big impact on my late father.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
Every holiday I had as a young boy

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
was in a national park.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
to protect the world,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
and show me just how fragile the world is.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
He also told me about the great explorers.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
walking all the way to the South Pole

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And so ever since I think I was just six years old,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
I dreamed of going to the polar regions.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
There was something about that place

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
which drew me to it.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
for a dream to come true.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
for the first time.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
ever since, for the last seven years.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
I love the place.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
But I have seen that place change

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
beyond all description,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
just in that short period of time.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
in search of food.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
I have swum in front of glaciers

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
which have retreated so much.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
And I have also, every year,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
seen less and less sea ice.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
In the two years before my swim,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
just melted away.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
to get them to understand what is happening.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
So I decided to do this symbolic swim

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
but which now is rapidly unfreezing.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And the message was very clear:

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Climate change is for real,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
and we need to do something about it.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And we need to do something about it right now.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
Well, swimming across the North Pole,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
it's not an ordinary thing to do.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
I mean, just to put it in perspective,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.330
This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
The passengers who fell off the Titanic

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Fresh water freezes at zero.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
It's fucking freezing.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
(Laughter)

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
(Applause)

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
(Laughter)

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
to help me with this task.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.330
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
you just dive into the sea and off you go.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And I then went and did a huge amount of training,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
But the most important thing was to train my mind

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
to prepare myself for what was going to happen.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And I had to visualize the swim.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
I had to see my coach screaming for me,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.330
"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
And so I literally swam across the North Pole

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I felt confident that I could actually

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
do this swim.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
So myself and the five members of the team,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
we hitched a ride on an icebreaker

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
which was going to the North Pole.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
five minute test swim.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
because it's just impossible to train

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
in those types of conditions.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
So we stopped the ship, as you do.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
We all got down onto the ice,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and I then got into my swimming costume

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
and I dived into the sea.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
I have never in my life felt anything

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
like that moment.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
I was hyperventilating so much,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
and within seconds my hands were numb.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And it was -- the paradox is

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
that you're in freezing cold water,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
but actually you're on fire.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
I remember just trying to get out of the water.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
I climbed out of the ice.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
And I remember taking the goggles off my face

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
because my fingers

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
had swollen so much that they were like sausages.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.330
And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
What had happened is that we are made partially of water,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
and when water freezes it expands.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
And so what had actually happened is

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
and trying to defrost my fingers.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.330
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
for one kilometer across the North Pole.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
with my father, was just going out the window.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.330
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
And I remember then getting out of the shower

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
because you need to be able to grab the water

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
and pull it through with you.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
The next morning, I woke up

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.330
and I was in such a state of depression,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
And after just three minutes in that water,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
he was able

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
to get himself out.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
And his hands were so badly frostbitten

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
that he had to return to England.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
He went to a local hospital and there they said,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
"Ran, there is no possibility

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
of us being able to save these fingers.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
We are going to actually have to take them off."

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and take out a saw

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
and do it himself.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.330
And all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.330
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.330
And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
I've known you since you were 18 years old.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
I've known you, and I know, Lewis,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
deep down, right deep down here,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
that you are going to make this swim.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
This is such an important swim.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
and you're going to make a symbolic swim here

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
Lewis, have the courage to go in there,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.330
because we are going to look after you every moment of it."

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
because he knew me so well.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
And we stopped the ship,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
and it was just as the scientists had predicted.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
There were open patches of sea everywhere.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
And I went down into my cabin

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
and I put on my swimming costume.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
which measures my core body temperature

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
and my heart rate.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
And then we walked out onto the ice.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
And I remember looking into the ice,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
and there were big chunks of white ice in there,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and the water was completely black.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
I had never seen black water before.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.330
And it is 4,200 meters deep.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.330
Just scuttle forward and go for it."

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
And so I now want to show you a short video

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
of what happened there on the ice.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
Everything just looks so gray around here,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
and looks so cold.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
We've just seen our first polar bears.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
It was absolutely magical.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
And to think that in 30, 40 years

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
they could become extinct.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
We're finally at the North Pole. This is

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
months and months and months of dreaming to get here,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
years of training and planning and preparation.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
It's all a little bit frightening,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
and emotional.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
Man: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
You did it! You did it man!

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
LP: How on earth did we do that?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
Man: Against the current! You did it against the current!

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:23.330
(Applause)

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
LP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:32.330
(Applause)

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Thank you so much.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
Audience: Encore!

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
(Laughter)

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.330
It took me four months again to feel my hands.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
There are very, very few people who don't know now

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
about what is happening in the Arctic.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.330
And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
And I say to them,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
I think we need to do three things.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.330
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
into manageable chunks.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
You saw during that video all those flags.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
Those flags represented the countries

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
from which my team came from.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.330
And equally, when it comes to climate change,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:16.330
every single country is going to have to make cuts.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
Britain, America, Japan,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.330
South Africa, the Congo.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:24.330
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.330
The second thing we need to do is

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
we need to just look back

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.330
at how far we have come

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
in such a short period of time.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.330
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
and people heckling me in the back

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
and saying it doesn't even exist.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.330
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.330
in some of the poorest townships in South Africa

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.330
to young children as young as 10 years old.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.330
Four or five children sitting behind a desk,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.330
and even in those poorest conditions,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.330
they all have a very, very good grasp

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.330
of climate change.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
We need to believe in ourselves.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
Now is the time to believe.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
We've come a long way. We're doing good.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
But the most important thing we must do

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.330
is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.330
and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.330
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.330
and what decision are we going to make today

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
to ensure that we all live

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
in a sustainable world?"

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.330
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:47.330
(Applause)
