00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:21.829
The murder happened a little over 21 years ago,

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.108
January the 18th, 1991,

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:28.369
in a small

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.743
bedroom community

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.578
of Lynwood, California, just a few miles

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:36.076
southeast of Los Angeles.

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:38.911
A father came out of his house

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:42.318
to tell his teenage son and his five friends

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.097
that it was time for them to stop horsing around

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:48.007
on the front lawn and on the sidewalk,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.915
to get home, finish their schoolwork,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.661
and prepare themselves for bed.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.231
And as the father was administering these instructions,

00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:00.569
a car drove by, slowly,

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.471
and just after it passed the father and the teenagers,

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:07.459
a hand went out from the front passenger window,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.721
and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father.

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.880
And the car sped off.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.721
The police,

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.551
investigating officers, were amazingly efficient.

00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.981
They considered all the usual culprits,

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:28.548
and in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:

00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:32.126
Francisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:34.163
who lived about two or three blocks away

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:36.898
from where the shooting occurred.

00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:41.546
They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:45.130
and the day after the shooting,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.023
they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:50.342
"That's the picture.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:55.729
That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.306
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:03.415
to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:06.102
for a first-degree murder.

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:09.309
In the investigation that followed before the actual trial,

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.720
each of the other five teenagers was shown

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.768
photographs, the same photo array.

00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:19.592
The picture that we best can determine was probably

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.864
the one that they were shown in the photo array

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:25.561
is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.

00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.997
The reason we're not sure absolutely is because

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:33.430
of the nature of evidence preservation

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.714
in our judicial system,

00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:40.462
but that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:43.368
So at the actual trial,

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:46.368
all six of the teenagers testified,

00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:50.126
and indicated the identifications they had made

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:53.602
in the photo array.

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:58.383
He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:03.842
and transported to Folsom Prison.

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:05.931
So what's wrong?

00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:10.697
Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:14.238
Oh yes, no gun was ever found.

00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:18.392
No vehicle was ever identified as being the one

00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:21.616
in which the shooter had extended his arm,

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:24.901
and no person was ever charged with being the driver

00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:28.143
of the shooter's vehicle.

00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:32.024
And Mr. Carrillo's alibi?

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:37.318
Which of those parents here in the room might not lie

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:40.137
concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:44.034
in an investigation of a killing?

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.856
Sent to prison,

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:52.354
adamantly insisting on his innocence,

00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:57.091
which he has consistently for 21 years.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.562
So what's the problem?

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:03.286
The problems, actually, for this kind of case

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:07.195
come manyfold from decades of scientific research

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:11.097
involving human memory.

00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:13.911
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses

00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:16.118
from the Innocence Project work,

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:18.815
where we know that we have, what,

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:22.596
250, 280 documented cases now where people have

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:26.668
been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:33.014
some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:36.675
and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:42.946
of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:46.593
testimony during the trial that convicted them.

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:51.768
We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.

00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:53.988
The other comes from an interesting aspect

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:57.191
of human memory that's related to various brain functions

00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:59.757
but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:02.141
in a simple line:

00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.889
The brain abhors a vacuum.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.799
Under the best of observation conditions,

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:12.671
the absolute best,

00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.384
we only detect, encode and store in our brains

00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:20.079
bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.408
and they're stored in different parts of the brain.

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:26.563
So now, when it's important for us to be able to recall

00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:29.584
what it was that we experienced,

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:34.862
we have an incomplete, we have a partial store,

00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:37.315
and what happens?

00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:40.139
Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.310
motivated processing, the brain fills in information

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.735
that was not there,

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:50.185
not originally stored,

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.729
from inference, from speculation,

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.541
from sources of information that came to you,

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.676
as the observer, after the observation.

00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:00.750
But it happens without awareness such that

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.384
you don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.651
It's called reconstructed memories.

00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.950
It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.214
It was those two considerations, among others --

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:18.719
reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility --

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.775
that was part of the instigation

00:06:21.775 --> 00:06:24.224
for a group of appeal attorneys

00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:27.696
led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers

00:06:27.696 --> 00:06:31.824
to pool their experience and their talents together

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.661
and petition a superior court

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:38.731
for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:43.119
They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:45.261
because I had expertise

00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:47.381
in eyewitness memory identification,

00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:50.576
which obviously makes sense for this case, right?

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.920
But also because I have expertise and testify about

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.297
the nature of human night vision.

00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:01.330
Well, what's that got to do with this?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.632
Well, when you read through the case materials

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:07.354
in this Carrillo case,

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:10.184
one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that

00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:13.674
the investigating officers said the lighting was good

00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:17.208
at the crime scene, at the shooting.

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:20.665
All the teenagers testified during the trial

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:24.144
that they could see very well.

00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:26.984
But this occurred in mid-January,

00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:32.983
in the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.

00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:36.008
So when I did the calculations

00:07:36.008 --> 00:07:38.220
for the lunar data and the solar data

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.399
at that location on Earth at the time of the incident

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.447
of the shooting, all right,

00:07:43.447 --> 00:07:46.064
it was well past the end of civil twilight

00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:48.320
and there was no moon up that night.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.599
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.183
is what you see on the screen right here.

00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:56.097
The only lighting in that area had to come

00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:59.367
from artificial sources,

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:02.135
and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:04.932
of the scene with photometers, with various measures

00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:06.906
of illumination and various other measures of

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:11.373
color perception, along with special cameras

00:08:11.373 --> 00:08:13.502
and high-speed film, right?

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:16.431
Take all the measurements and record them, right?

00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.588
And then take photographs, and this is what the scene

00:08:18.588 --> 00:08:20.023
looked like at the time of the shooting

00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:22.489
from the position of the teenagers

00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:26.311
looking at the car going by and shooting.

00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:28.616
This is looking directly across the street

00:08:28.616 --> 00:08:30.944
from where they were standing.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:33.297
Remember, the investigating officers' report said

00:08:33.297 --> 00:08:35.530
the lighting was good.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.964
The teenagers said they could see very well.

00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:41.215
This is looking down to the east,

00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:44.911
where the shooting vehicle sped off,

00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:49.803
and this is the lighting directly behind the father

00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:52.144
and the teenagers.

00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:56.055
As you can see, it is at best poor.

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:59.928
No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,

00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:03.122
and in fact, as nice as these pictures are,

00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:06.583
and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:09.775
and a picture is worth more than a thousand words

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:12.175
when you're trying to communicate numbers,

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:15.447
abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement

00:09:15.447 --> 00:09:20.623
of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:23.784
When you present those to people who are not well-versed

00:09:23.784 --> 00:09:26.900
in those aspects of science and that, they become

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.279
salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:32.193
talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?

00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:34.978
Their eyes just glaze over, all right?

00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:39.337
A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,

00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:41.496
a good communicator, and that's part of the reason

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.791
why we take the pictures, to show not only

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:46.591
where the light sources are, and what we call the spill,

00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.220
the distribution, but also so that it's easier

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.255
for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:56.128
So these are some of the pictures that, in fact,

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.543
I used when I testified,

00:09:58.543 --> 00:10:00.408
but more importantly were, to me as a scientist,

00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:02.391
are those readings, the photometer readings,

00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:06.991
which I can then convert into actual predictions

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:10.511
of the visual capability of the human eye

00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:12.887
under those circumstances,

00:10:12.887 --> 00:10:16.535
and from my readings that I recorded at the scene

00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:18.775
under the same solar and lunar conditions

00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:21.767
at the same time, so on and so forth, right,

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.173
I could predict

00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:25.365
that there would be no reliable color perception,

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:27.679
which is crucial for face recognition,

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.991
and that there would be only scotopic vision,

00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:31.951
which means there would be very little resolution,

00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.199
what we call boundary or edge detection,

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:36.514
and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been

00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:40.319
totally dilated under this light, the depth of field,

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:43.477
the distance at which you can focus and see details,

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:48.871
would have been less than 18 inches away.

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:51.375
I testified to that to the court,

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:53.808
and while the judge was very attentive,

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:56.415
it had been a very, very long hearing

00:10:56.415 --> 00:11:01.159
for this petition for a retrial, and as a result,

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.919
I noticed out of the corner of my eye

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:07.064
that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need

00:11:07.064 --> 00:11:09.127
a little more of a nudge

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.635
than just more numbers.

00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:13.927
And here I became a bit audacious,

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.447
and I turned

00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:17.839
and I asked the judge,

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:20.247
I said, "Your Honor, I think you should go out

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.951
and look at the scene yourself."

00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:26.092
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare

00:11:26.092 --> 00:11:28.496
than a request — (Laughter) —

00:11:28.496 --> 00:11:32.943
but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage

00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:36.559
that he said, "Yes, I will."

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:40.551
A shocker in American jurisprudence.

00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:43.023
So in fact, we found the same identical conditions,

00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:45.064
we reconstructed the entire thing again,

00:11:45.064 --> 00:11:49.074
he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers

00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:54.231
to protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:59.285
We had him stand actually slightly in the street,

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:02.465
so closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:05.207
than the actual teenagers were,

00:12:05.207 --> 00:12:07.431
so he stood a few feet from the curb

00:12:07.431 --> 00:12:10.043
toward the middle of the street.

00:12:10.043 --> 00:12:12.960
We had a car that came by,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.911
same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?

00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:19.848
It had a driver and a passenger,

00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:23.671
and after the car had passed the judge by,

00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:27.185
the passenger extended his hand,

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:31.759
pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.978
just as the teenagers had described it, right?

00:12:33.978 --> 00:12:36.831
Now, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,

00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:39.249
so he had a black object in his hand that was similar

00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:41.228
to the gun that was described.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:44.074
He pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.

00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:51.173
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge.

00:12:51.173 --> 00:12:54.085
There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:56.458
and pointed back at you.

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:58.423
That's 30 feet away.

00:12:58.423 --> 00:13:00.615
Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car

00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:03.191
was 15 feet away when it shot.

00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.855
Okay. There's 15 feet.

00:13:06.855 --> 00:13:11.025
At this point, I became a little concerned.

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:15.759
This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:20.047
He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.

00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:23.316
I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.

00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:26.817
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this,

00:13:26.817 --> 00:13:29.857
and after he looked at this reenactment,

00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:30.937
he turned to me and he says,

00:13:30.937 --> 00:13:34.195
"Is there anything else you want me to look at?"

00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:38.690
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.647
emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had

00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:45.343
in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,

00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:47.598
or whether it was just sheer stupidity,

00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:50.423
which is what the defense lawyers thought — (Laughter) —

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:52.175
when they heard me say,

00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:54.879
"Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:59.215
and I want the car to go around the block again

00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:02.569
and I want it to come and I want it to stop

00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:06.759
right in front of you, three to four feet away,

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:10.215
and I want the passenger to extend his hand

00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:12.231
with a black object and point it right at you,

00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:17.951
and you can look at it as long as you want."

00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:22.378
And that's what he saw. (Laughter)

00:14:22.378 --> 00:14:26.218
You'll notice, which was also in my test report,

00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:28.863
all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,

00:14:28.863 --> 00:14:30.606
which means that the shooter's face would

00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:33.222
have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.124
Furthermore, the roof of the car

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:39.398
is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car

00:14:39.398 --> 00:14:42.728
which is making it darker.

00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:46.840
And this is three to four feet away.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.968
Why did I take the risk?

00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:54.197
I knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.

00:14:54.197 --> 00:14:55.864
Three to four feet, it might as well have been

00:14:55.864 --> 00:15:00.336
a football field away.

00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:02.544
This is what he saw.

00:15:02.544 --> 00:15:06.344
He went back, there was a few more days of evidence

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:08.648
that was heard. At the end of it,

00:15:08.648 --> 00:15:11.276
he made the judgment that he was going to grant

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:14.354
the petition for a retrial.

00:15:14.354 --> 00:15:16.832
And furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.819
so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:25.838
if the prosecution decided to retry him.

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:28.148
Which they decided not to.

00:15:28.148 --> 00:15:33.209
He is now a freed man. (Applause)

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:37.152
(Applause)

00:15:37.152 --> 00:15:42.256
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:46.331
He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,

00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:50.416
right? And she had a little baby boy.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.097
He and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach

00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:59.285
right now taking classes. (Applause)

00:15:59.285 --> 00:16:03.248
And what does this example --

00:16:03.248 --> 00:16:07.592
what's important to keep in mind for ourselves?

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:11.288
First of all, there's a long history of antipathy

00:16:11.288 --> 00:16:13.368
between science and the law

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:15.768
in American jurisprudence.

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:19.216
I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:23.552
over decades of experience as a forensic expert

00:16:23.552 --> 00:16:28.058
of just trying to get science into the courtroom.

00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:32.992
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.379
One suggestion is that all of us become much more

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:39.248
attuned to the necessity, through policy,

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.304
through procedures,

00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:44.488
to get more science in the courtroom,

00:16:44.488 --> 00:16:46.799
and I think one large step toward that

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:48.641
is more requirements,

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:51.200
with all due respect to the law schools,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.311
of science, technology, engineering, mathematics

00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:58.288
for anyone going into the law,

00:16:58.288 --> 00:17:01.912
because they become the judges.

00:17:01.912 --> 00:17:04.960
Think about how we select our judges in this country.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.320
It's very different than most other cultures. All right?

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.730
The other one that I want to suggest,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.160
the caution that all of us have to have,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.000
I constantly have to remind myself,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.103
about just how accurate are the memories

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:23.472
that we know are true, that we believe in?

00:17:23.472 --> 00:17:26.856
There is decades of research,

00:17:26.856 --> 00:17:31.024
examples and examples of cases like this,

00:17:31.024 --> 00:17:32.992
where individuals

00:17:32.992 --> 00:17:36.504
really, really believe. None of those teenagers

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:38.336
who identified him

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:41.612
thought that they were picking the wrong person.

00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:44.966
None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.

00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:47.098
We all have to be very careful.

00:17:47.098 --> 00:17:50.738
All our memories are reconstructed memories.

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:53.136
They are the product of what we originally experienced

00:17:53.136 --> 00:17:55.869
and everything that's happened afterwards.

00:17:55.869 --> 00:17:57.920
They're dynamic.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.408
They're malleable. They're volatile,

00:18:00.408 --> 00:18:04.432
and as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,

00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:07.752
that the accuracy of our memories

00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:11.256
is not measured in how vivid they are

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:16.387
nor how certain you are that they're correct.

00:18:16.387 --> 00:20:45.477
Thank you. (Applause)
