00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I have a studio in London

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that has a particular approach

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
to designing buildings.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
When I was growing up,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I was exposed to making

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and crafts and materials

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and invention on a small scale.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And I was there looking

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
at the larger scale of buildings

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and finding

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that the buildings that were around me

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and that were being designed

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and that were there in the publications I was seeing

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
felt soulless and cold.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And there on the smaller scale,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the scale of an earring

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
or a ceramic pot

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
or a musical instrument,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
was a materiality and a soulfulness.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And this influenced me.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
The first building I built was 20 years ago.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And since, in the last 20 years,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I've developed a studio in London.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
in her bead shop in London.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
a few projects that we've worked on.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
This is a hospital building.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
This is a shop for a bag company.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This is studios for artists.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
This is a sculpture

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
made from a million yards of wire

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and 150,000 glass beads

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
the size of a golf ball.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And this is a window display.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And this is pair of cooling towers

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
for an electricity substation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And this is a temple in Japan

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
for a Buddhist monk.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And this is a cafe by the sea

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
in Britain.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And just very quickly,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
something we've been working on very recently

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is we were commissioned by the mayor of London

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
to design a new bus

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that gave the passenger

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
their freedom again.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Because the original Routemaster bus

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that some of you may be familiar with,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
which had this open platform at the back --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in fact, I think all our Routemasters

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
are here in California now actually.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
But they aren't in London.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And so you're stuck on a bus.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And if the bus is going to stop

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and it's three yards away from the bus stop,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
you're just a prisoner.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
buses with this open platform.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So we've been working with Transport for London,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and that organization

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
hasn't actually been responsible

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
as a client for a new bus

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
for 50 years.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So it's got hybrid drive.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And we've been working

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
to try to improve

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
everything from the fabric

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
to the format

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and structure

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and aesthetics.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I was going to show four main projects.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And this is a project for a bridge.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And openings seemed --

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
everyone loves opening bridges,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
but it's quite a basic thing.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I think we all kind of stand and watch.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
But the bridges that we saw

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that opened and closed --

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
I'm slightly squeamish --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
but I once saw a photograph of a footballer

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
who was diving for a ball.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and it had broken like this.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and just couldn't help feeling

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that it was a beautiful thing that had broken.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And so this is in Paddington in London.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It's just steel and timber.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
But instead of what it is,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
our focus was on the way it worked.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.260
(Applause)

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
would end up kissing each other.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:58.260
(Applause)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
We actually had to halve its speed,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
because everyone was too scared when we first did it.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So that's it speeded up.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
A project that we've been working on very recently

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is to design a new biomass power station --

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
so a power station that uses organic waste material.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
In the news,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the subject of where our future water is going to come from

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and where our power is going to come from

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is in all the papers all the time.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But recently,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
any annual report of a power company

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
doesn't have a power station on it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It has a child running through a field, or something like that.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
(Laughter)

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And so when a consortium of engineers approached us

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and asked us to work with them on this power station,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
our condition was that we would work with them

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and that, whatever we did,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.260
we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And so we spent time traveling with them

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and learning about all the different elements,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that weren't being capitalized on.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
That just taking a field and banging all these things out

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
instead of just litter, create one composition.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And what we found --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And there are 2,000 new homes being built

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
next to this power station.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So it felt this has a social dimension.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It has a symbolic importance.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So we were looking at how we could make a power station,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
that, instead of keeping people out

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and having a big fence around the outside,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
could be a place that pulls you in.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And it has to be --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I'm trying to get my --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
250 feet high.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So it felt that what we could try to do

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
is make a power park

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
and actually bring the whole area in,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and using the spare soil that's there on the site,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
we could make a power station that was silent as well.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Because just that soil

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
could make the acoustic difference.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and have a cost-effective way

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
of making a structure to do this.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
The finished project

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is meant to be more than just a power station.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
(Laughter)

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And it's a power park.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
So people can come and really experience this

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and also look out all around the area,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and use that height that we have to have for its function.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
In Shanghai,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
we were invited to build --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
well we weren't invited; what am I talking about.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
We won the competition, and it was painful to get there.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.260
(Laughter)

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And an expo

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is a totally bonkers thing.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
There's 250 pavilions.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So there are up to a million people there everyday.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And 250 countries all competing.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And the British government saying,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
"You need to be in the top five."

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And so that became

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
the governmental goal --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
is, how do you stand out in this chaos,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
which is an expo of stimulus?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
So our sense was we had to do one thing,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and only one thing,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
instead of trying to have everything.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And so what we also felt

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
(Laughter)

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
But the thing that was true,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
the expo was about the future of cities,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and particularly the Victorians

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
pioneered integrating nature into the cities.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And the world's first public park of modern times

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
was in Britain.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And the world's first major botanical institution

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
is in London,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and they have this extraordinary project

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
where they've been collecting 25 percent

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
of all the world's plant species.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And the same with flowers.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers."

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
But we realized that seeds --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
there's been this very serious project happening --

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
but that seeds --

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
at these major botanical gardens,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
seeds aren't on show.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
But you just have to go to a garden center,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and they're in little paper packets.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
But this phenomenal project's been happening.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So we realized we had to make a project

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
gave us some kind of clue

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
that these tiny things

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
could be trapped and be made to seem precious,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
rather than looking like nuts.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So the challenge was,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
how are we going to bring light and expose these things?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
So we were trying to think,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
how could we make a whole thing emanate.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
So that was also in the mix

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
with the site the size of a football pitch.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
So the idea

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
was to take these 66,000 seeds

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
that they agreed to give us,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and to take each seed and trap it

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
in this precious optical hair

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and grow that through this box,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
very simple box element,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and make it a building

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
that could move in the wind.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And inside, the daylight --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
each one is an optic

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and it brings light into the center.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And by night,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
artificial light in each one

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
emanates and comes out to the outside.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And to make the project affordable,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
we focused our energy.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
we focused it on this one element.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And the government agreed to do that

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and not do anything else,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and focus our energy on that.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And so the rest of the site was a public space.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And with a million people there a day,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
it just felt like offering some public space.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
to develop a mini-me version

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
of the seed cathedral,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
so that, even if you're partially-sighted,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
that it was kind of crunchy and soft,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that piece of landscape that you see there.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And then, you know when a pet has an operation

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and they shave a bit of the skin

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and get rid of the fur --

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
in effect, we've shaved it.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And inside there's nothing;

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
there's no famous actor's voice;

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
there's no projections;

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
there's no televisions; there's no color changing.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
There's just silence

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
and a cool temperature.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And if a cloud goes past,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
you can see a cloud on the tips

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
where it's letting the light through.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
This is the only project that we've done

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
where the finished thing

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
looked more like a rendering than our renderings.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
(Laughter)

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
A key thing was how people would interact.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
you could possible do at the expo.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And I just wanted to show you.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
The British government --

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
any government is potentially the worst client in the world

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
you could ever possibly want to have.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And there was a lot of terror.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
But there was an underlying support.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And so there was a moment

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
when suddenly -- actually, the next thing.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
who was our client,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.260
with the Chinese children, using the landscape.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
(Video) Children: One, two, three, go.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
(Laughter)

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
TH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
(Laughter)

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So finally, texture is something.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
In the projects we've been working on,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
these slick buildings,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
where they might be a fancy shape,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
but the materiality feels the same,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.260
is something that we've been trying to research really,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and explore alternatives.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And the project that we're building in Malaysia

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
is apartment buildings

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
for a property developer.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And it's in a piece of land

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
that's this site.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
said that, if this developer

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
would give something that gave something back to the city,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
they would give them more gross floor area, buildable.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
So there was an incentive for the developer

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
to really try to think about

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
what would be better for the city.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
in this part of the world

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
is you have your tower,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and you squeeze a few trees around the edge,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and you see cars parked.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
and the rest of it is just for postcards.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
So if we could chop that away

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and give the building a small bottom,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
we could take that bit and put it at the top

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
where the greater commercial value is for a property developer.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And by linking these together,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
we could have 90 percent of the site

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
as a rainforest,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and bits of road around buildings.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.260
(Applause)

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So we're building these buildings.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
They're just chopped at different heights.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
But the key part

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.260
rather than engulf it.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And that's my final slide.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Thank you.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
(Applause)

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Thank you.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:47.260
(Applause)

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
June Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Since we have an extra minute here,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.260
which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
TH: These are a few of the tests we did

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
when we were building the structure.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
So there were 66,000 of these.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
This optic

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
was 22 feet long.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And so the daylight was just coming --

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
it was caught on the outside of the box

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and was coming down to illuminate each seed.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.260
but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it --

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:34.260
we had quite a time.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
There was one person in the contractors who was the right size --

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and it wasn't a child --

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
who could fit between them

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
for the final waterproofing of the building.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
JC: Thank you, Thomas.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
(Applause)
