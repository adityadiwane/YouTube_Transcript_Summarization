00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Mountain biking in Israel

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is something that I do with great passion

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and commitment.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And when I'm on my bike,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I feel that I connect

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
with the profound beauty of Israel,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and I feel that I'm united

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
with this country's history

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and biblical law.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And also, for me,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
biking is a matter of empowerment.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
When I reach the summit

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I feel young,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
invincible, eternal.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
or with some energy

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
far greater than myself.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
You can see my fellow riders

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
at the end of the picture,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
looking at me with some concern.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And here is another picture of them.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
neither can I disclose their true names,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and that's because my fellow riders

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
are juvenile inmates,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
offenders

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
spending time in a correction facility

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
about 20 minutes' ride from here --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
well, like everything in Israel.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And I've been riding with these kids once a week,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This story began four years ago.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
The correction facility where they are locked up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
happens to be right in the middle

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
of one of my usual trips,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and it's surrounded by barbed wires

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and electric gates and armed guards.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So on one of these rides,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I talked my way into the compound

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and went to see the warden.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I told the warden

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and that basically I wanted to take the kids

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
from here to there.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And I told him, "Let's find a way

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to ride with in the summer in the country."

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And the warden was quite amused,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and he told me he thought that I was a nut

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and he told me,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
They are supposed to be locked up.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
They aren't supposed to be out at large."

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And yet, we began to talk about it,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and one thing led to another.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And I can't see myself

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
going into a state prison in New Jersey

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and making such a proposition,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
but this being Israel,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
the warden somehow made it happen.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And so two months later,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
we found ourselves "at large" --

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
myself,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
10 juvenile inmates

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and a wonderful fellow named Russ,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
who became a very good friend of mine

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and my partner in this project.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
of introducing these kids

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
to the world of total freedom,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
a world consisting of magnificent vistas

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
like these --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
everything you see here is obviously in Israel --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
as well as close encounters

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
with all sorts of small creatures

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
coming in all sorts of sizes,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
colors, shapes, forms

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and so on.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
In spite of all this splendor,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
the beginning was extremely frustrating.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Every small obstacle,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
every slight uphill,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
would cause these fellows

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
to stop in their tracks and give up.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So we had a lot of this going on.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
I found out that they had a very hard time

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
dealing with frustration and difficulties --

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
not because they were physically unfit.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And I became increasingly more and more agitated,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
because I was there

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
not only to be with them,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
but also to ride and create a team

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and I didn't know what to do.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Now, let me give you an example.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and the front tire of Alex

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
gets caught in one of these crevasses here.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
So he crashes down,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and he gets slightly injured,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
but this does not prevent him from jumping up

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and then starting to jump up and down on his bike

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and curse violently.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Then he throws his helmet in the air.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And then he runs to the nearest tree

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and starts to break branches and throw rocks

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and curse like I've never heard.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And I'm just standing there,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
watching this scene

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
with a complete disbelief,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
not knowing what to do.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
I'm used to algorithms

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and data structures

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and super motivated students,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and nothing in my background

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
prepared me to deal

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
with a raging, violent adolescent

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And you have to realize that these incidents

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
did not happen in convenient locations.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
They happened in places like this,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
in the Judean Desert,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
20 kilometers away from the nearest road.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And what you don't see in this picture

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
is that somewhere between these riders there,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
there's a teenager sitting on a rock,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I've had it."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Well, that's a problem

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
At the beginning, it was a disaster.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I tried harsh words and threats

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and they took me nowhere.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
That's what they had all their lives.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And at some point I found out,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
when a kid like this gets into a fit,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
the best thing that you can possibly do

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
is stay as close as possible to this kid,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
which is difficult,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
because what you really want to do is go away.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
But that's what he had all his life,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
people walking away from him.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So what you have to do is stay close

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and try to reach in

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and pet his shoulder

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
or give him a piece of chocolate.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Why don't you rest for a few minutes

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and then we'll go on."

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
"Go away you maniac-psychopath.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?"

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And I would say, "Relax, Alex.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Here's a piece of chocolate."

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Because you have to understand

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that on these rides we are constantly hungry --

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and after the rides also.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
He's a 17-year-old.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
When he was eight,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
someone put him on a boat in Odessa

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and sent him, shipped him to Israel

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
on his own.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and did not have the good luck

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to be picked up by a [unclear]

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and roamed the streets

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and became a prominent gang member.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And he spent the last 10 years of his life

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
in two places only,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
the slums and the state prison,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
where he spent the last two years

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
before he ended up sitting on this rock there.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And so this kid

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
was probably abused,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
abandoned, ignored, betrayed

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
by almost every adult along the way.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
So, for such a kid,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and doesn't walk away from him

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in any situation,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
irrespective of how he behaves,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
it's a tremendous healing experience.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
It's an act of unconditional acceptance,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
something that he never had.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I want to say a few words about vision.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
When I started this program four years ago,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
I had this original plan

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
of creating a team

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
of winning underdogs.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
I had an image of Lance Armstrong

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
in my mind.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And it took me exactly two months

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
of complete frustration

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to realize that this vision

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
was misplaced,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and that there was another vision

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
supremely more important

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and more readily available.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that the purpose of these rides

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
should actually be

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
to expose the kids

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to one thing only: love.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Love to the country, to the uphill

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and the downhill,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to all the incredible creatures that surround us --

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
the animals, the plants,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
the insects --

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
love and respect

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
to other fellow members in your team,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
in your biking team,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and most importantly,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
love and respect to yourself,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
which is something

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that they badly miss.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Together with the kids,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
I also went through a remarkable transformation.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Now, I come from a cutthroat world

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
of science and high technology.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
I used to think that reason and logic

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
and relentless drive

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
were the only ways to make things happen.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And before I worked with the kids,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
anything that I did with them,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
or anything that I did with myself,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
was supposed to be perfect,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
ideal, optimal,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but after working with them for some time,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I discovered the great virtues of empathy

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and flexibility

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and being able to start with some vision,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and come up with something that does help, that does work.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
So right now, I feel more

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
like these are my principles,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and if you don't like them,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
I have others.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
(Laughter)

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.260
(Applause)

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
And one of these principles

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
is focus.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Before each ride

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
we sit together with the kids,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and we give them one word

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to think about during the ride.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
You have to focus their attention on something

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
because so many things happen.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So these are words like "teamwork"

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
or "endurance"

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
or even complicated concepts

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
like "resource allocation"

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
or "perspective," a word that they don't understand.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
You know, perspective

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
is one of these critically important

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
life-coping strategies

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
that mountain biking can really teach you.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I tell kids

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
when they struggle through some uphill

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and feel like they cannot take it anymore,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and raise your head and look around

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and see how the vista around you grows.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
It literally propels you upwards.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
That's what perspective is all about.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Or you can also look back in time

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and realize that you've already conquered

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
steeper mountains before.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
And that's how they develop self-esteem.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Now, let me give you an example of how it works.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and it's drizzling

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and cold and chilly,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that's where you're supposed to climb now --

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And yet, two hours later

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
smeared with mud,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
blood and sweat.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And you look down at Yokneam;

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
everything is so small and tiny.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
It's that big.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
I can't believe that I did it."

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
And that's the point

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
when you start loving yourself.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And so we talked about

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
these special words that we teach them.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And at the end of each ride, we sit together

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and share moments

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
in which those special words of the day

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
popped up and made a difference,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and these discussions

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
can be extremely inspiring.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
In one of them, one of the kids once said,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
"When we were riding on this ridge

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
overlooking the Dead Sea --

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and he's talking about this spot here --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
"I was reminded

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and went away together with my brother.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
We walked 120 kilometers

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
until we reached Sudan.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
probably for the first time in his life.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
adults, who are sitting there

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
listening to him --

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and he says, "And this was just the beginning

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
of our ordeal

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
until we ended up in Israel.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And only now," he says,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
"I'm beginning to understand where I am,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and I actually like it."

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Now I remember, when he said it,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
I felt goosebumps on my body,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
That's where Joshua descended

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and crossed the Jordan

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
3,000 years ago

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
in this final leg

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
of the journey from Africa.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And so, perspective

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and context and history

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
play key roles

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
in the way I plan my rides

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
with the kids.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
We visit Kibbutzim

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that were established by Holocaust survivors.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
We explore ruins

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
of Palestinian villages,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and we discuss how they became ruins.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
And we go through numerous remnants

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Canaanite settlements --

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
three-, four, five-thousand years old.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
And through this tapestry,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
which is the history of this country,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
the kids acquire

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
what is probably the most important

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
value in education,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and that is the understanding that life is complex,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
and there's no black and white.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
And by appreciating complexity,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
they become more tolerant,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and tolerance leads to hope.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
I ride with these kids once a week,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
every Tuesday.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and I ride with them tomorrow also.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
In every one of these rides

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
taking in this incredible landscape around me,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and I feel blessed and fortunate

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
that I'm alive,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and that I sense every fiber

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
in my aching body.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And I feel blessed and fortunate

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
that 15 years ago

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
I had the courage to resign

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
my tenured position at NYU

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and return to my home country

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
where I can do these incredible rides

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
with this group of troubled kids

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
coming from Ethiopia

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
and Morocco and Russia.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
And I feel blessed and fortunate

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
that every week, every Tuesday --

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and actually every Friday also --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
I can once again celebrate

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
in the marrow of my bones

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Thank you.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:39.260
(Applause)
