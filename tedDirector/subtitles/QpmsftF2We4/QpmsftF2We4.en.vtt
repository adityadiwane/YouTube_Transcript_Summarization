00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The things we make

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
have one supreme quality --

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
they live longer than us.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
We perish, they survive;

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
we have one life, they have many lives,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and in each life they can mean different things.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Which means that, while we all have one biography,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
they have many.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I want this morning to talk

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
of one particular object,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
one remarkable thing.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It doesn't, I agree,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
look very much.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It's about the size of a rugby ball.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It's made of clay,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and it's been fashioned

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
into a cylinder shape,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
covered with close writing

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and then baked dry in the sun.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And as you can see,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
it's been knocked about a bit,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
which is not surprising

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
because it was made two and a half thousand years ago

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and was dug up

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
in 1879.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
But today,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
this thing is, I believe,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
a major player

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in the politics of the Middle East.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And it's an object

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
with fascinating stories

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and stories that are by no means over yet.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The story begins

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
in the Iran-Iraq war

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and that series of events

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that culminated

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in the invasion of Iraq

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
by foreign forces,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
the removal of a despotic ruler

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and instant regime change.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And I want to begin

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
with one episode from that sequence of events

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that most of you would be very familiar with,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Belshazzar's feast --

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of 539 BC.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And the parallels

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
between the events

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of 539 BC and 2003 and in between

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
are startling.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
now in the National Gallery in London,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And you all know roughly the story.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and captured the people

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and taken the Jews back to Babylon.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
had been taken to Babylon.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Belshazzar, his son,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
decides to have a feast.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And in order to make it even more exciting,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and he brings out the temple vessels.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
He's already at war with the Iranians,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
with the king of Persia.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And that night, Daniel tells us,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
at the height of the festivities

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and your kingdom is handed over

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
to the Medes and the Persians."

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And that very night

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
It is, of course, a great moment

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in the history

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
of the Jewish people.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It's a great story. It's story we all know.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
"The writing on the wall"

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
is part of our everyday language.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
What happened next

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
was remarkable,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and it's where our cylinder

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
enters the story.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Cyrus, king of the Persians,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
has entered Babylon without a fight --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
the great empire of Babylon,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
which ran from central southern Iraq

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to the Mediterranean,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
falls to Cyrus.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And Cyrus makes a declaration.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And that is what this cylinder is,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
the declaration made by the ruler guided by God

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
who had toppled the Iraqi despot

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and was going to bring freedom to the people.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
In ringing Babylonian --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
it was written in Babylonian --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
the great king, the powerful king,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
This is probably

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
the first real press release

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
by a victorious army

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that we've got.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And it's written, as we'll see in due course,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
by very skilled P.R. consultants.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And what is the great king, the powerful king,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
he will at once let all the peoples

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
have captured and enslaved

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
go free.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
He'll let them return to their countries.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And more important,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
he will let them all recover

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the gods, the statues,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the temple vessels

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
that had been confiscated.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
will go home,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and they'll take with them their gods.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And they'll be able to restore their altars

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and to worship their gods

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
in their own way, in their own place.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
This is the decree,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
this object is the evidence

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
for the fact that the Jews,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
after the exile in Babylon,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
weeping when they remembered Jerusalem,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
those Jews were allowed to go home.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and to rebuild the temple.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It's a central document

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
in Jewish history.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
reported in ringing terms.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
This is the Jewish version

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of the same story.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and he has charged me

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to build him a house in Jerusalem.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Who is there among you of his people?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
The Lord God be with him,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and let him go up.'"

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
"Go up" -- aaleh.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
The central element, still,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
of the notion of return,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
a central part

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
of the life of Judaism.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
As you all know, that return from exile,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
the second temple,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
reshaped Judaism.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And that change,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
that great historic moment,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.260
was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
reported for us in Hebrew in scripture

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and in Babylonian in clay.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Two great texts,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
what about the politics?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
What was going on

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
united under Cyrus,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
became the first great world empire.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And by the time of his son Darius,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
the whole of the eastern Mediterranean

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is under Persian control.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
This empire is, in fact,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
the Middle East as we now know it,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Much more important,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
it was the first

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
multicultural, multifaith state

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
on a huge scale.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And it had to be run in a quite new way.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
It had to be run in different languages.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And it had to recognize their different habits,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
different peoples, different religions, different faiths.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
All of those are respected by Cyrus.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Cyrus sets up a model

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
of how you run

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.260
a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And the result of that

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and which survived for 200 years of stability

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
until it was shattered by Alexander.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and a unit where people of different faiths

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
could live together.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The Greek invasions ended that.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and it fragmented.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
But what Cyrus represented

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
remained absolutely central.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
The Greek historian Xenophon

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
wrote his book "Cyropaedia"

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And throughout European culture afterward,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Cyrus remained the model.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
This is a 16th century image

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to show you how widespread

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
his veneration actually was.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
on how you ran a diverse society

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
was one of the great textbooks

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
that inspired the Founding Fathers

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
of the American Revolution.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Jefferson was a great admirer --

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the ideals of Cyrus

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
of how you create religious tolerance

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
in a new state.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Meanwhile, back in Babylon,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
things had not been going well.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
After Alexander, the other empires,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Babylon declines, falls into ruins,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
until 1879

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
when the cylinder is discovered

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And it enters now another story.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
It enters that great debate

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
in the middle of the 19th century:

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
We only knew

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
from the Hebrew scriptures.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
No other evidence.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Suddenly, this appeared.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
And great excitement

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
to a world where those who believed in the scriptures

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
had had their faith in creation shaken

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
by evolution, by geology,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
here was evidence

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
that the scriptures were historically true.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
It's a great 19th century moment.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.260
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated --

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
the facts were true,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
hurrah for archeology,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
but the interpretation was rather more complicated.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
differ in one key respect.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
The Babylonian cylinder

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
is written by the priests

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And, not surprisingly,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
calls him to shepherd his people

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and gives him the rule of Babylon.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Marduk tells Cyrus

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
that he will do these great, generous things

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
of setting the people free.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
And this is why we should all be grateful to

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and worship Marduk.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
The Hebrew writers

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in the Old Testament,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
you will not be surprised to learn,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
take a rather different view of this.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that made all this happen.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
It can only be Jehovah.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And so in Isaiah,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
we have the wonderful texts

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
giving all the credit of this,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.260
not to Marduk

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
but to the Lord God of Israel --

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
the Lord God of Israel

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
who also called Cyrus by name,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
also takes Cyrus by the hand

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and talks of him shepherding his people.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
It's a remarkable example

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
of two different priestly appropriations of the same event,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
two different religious takeovers

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
of a political fact.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
God, we know,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
is usually on the side of the big battalions.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
The question is, which god was it?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And the debate unsettles

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
everybody in the 19th century

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
to realize that the Hebrew scriptures

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
are part of a much wider world of religion.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
And it's quite clear

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and yet, Jehovah is speaking

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
in words very similar

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to those used by Marduk.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
because he says,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
this is God speaking, of course,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
"I have called thee by thy name

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
though thou hast not known me."

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
I think it's recognized

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that Cyrus doesn't realize

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Because interestingly, of course,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Cyrus is a good Iranian

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
with a totally different set of gods

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
who are not mentioned in any of these texts.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
(Laughter)

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
That's 1879.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
40 years on

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and we're in 1917,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and the cylinder enters a different world.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
This time, the real politics

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
of the contemporary world --

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
the year of the Balfour Declaration,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
decides that it will declare

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
a Jewish national home,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
it will allow

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
the Jews to return.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
And the response to this

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And across Eastern Europe,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Jews display pictures of Cyrus

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
and of George V

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
side by side --

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
the two great rulers

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and the text of this

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
as a demonstration of why what is going to happen

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
after the war is over in 1918

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
is part of a divine plan.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
You all know what happened.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
The state of Israel is setup,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and 50 years later, in the late 60s,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
And another story of the cylinder begins.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
has to be kept safe from communism,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
and the superpower that will be created to do this

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
would be Iran, the Shah.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
or a return to Iranian history,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that puts him in the center of a great tradition

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and produces coins

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
showing himself

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
with the Cyrus cylinder.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
he summons the cylinder

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and is part of those great celebrations

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
of the Pahlavi dynasty.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
10 years later, another story:

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Iranian Revolution, 1979.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus;

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
we're not interested in that history,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
we're interested in Islamic Iran --

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
until Iraq,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
attacks.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Then another Iran-Iraq war.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And it becomes critical for the Iranians

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
to remember their great past,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
their great past

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
when they fought Iraq and won.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
It becomes critical to find a symbol

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that will pull together all Iranians --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Muslims and non-Muslims,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
people who are devout, not devout.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
cooperate and work together, as we've been doing,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
the Iranians ask for one thing only

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
as a loan.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
It's the only object they want.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And last year,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.260
the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
for the second time.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
It's shown being presented here, put into its case

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
by the director of the National Museum of Tehran,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Mrs. Ardakani.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
It was a huge event.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
This is the other side of that same picture.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
It's seen in Tehran

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
by between one and two million people

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
in the space of a few months.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
in the West.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And it's the subject of a huge debate

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder --

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Cyrus as the defender of the homeland,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
the champion, of course, of Iranian identity

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
and of the Iranian peoples,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
tolerant of all faiths.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And in the current Iran,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
To see this object in Tehran,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
thousands of Jews living in Iran

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
came to Tehran to see it.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
It became a great emblem,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
a great subject of debate

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
about what Iran is at home and abroad.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
Will Iran set free the people

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
This is heady national rhetoric,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and it was all put together

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
in a great pageant

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
launching the return.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
with great figures from Iranian history

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
gathering to take their place

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
in the heritage of Iran.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
It was a narrative presented

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
by the president himself.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
And for me,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
to take this object to Iran,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
to be allowed to take this object to Iran

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
was to be allowed to be part

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
of an extraordinary debate

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
led at the highest levels

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
about what Iran is,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
what different Irans there are

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
and how the different histories of Iran

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
might shape the world today.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
It's a debate that's still continuing,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
and it will continue to rumble,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
because this object

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
is one of the great declarations

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
of a human aspiration.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.260
It stands with the American constitution.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
It certainly says far more about real freedoms

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
than Magna Carta.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
It is a document that can mean so many things,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
for Iran and for the region.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
A replica of this

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
is at the United Nations.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
In New York this autumn, it will be present

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
when the great debates

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
about the future of the Middle East take place.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
And I want to finish by asking you

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
what the next story will be

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
in which this object figures.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
It will appear, certainly,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
in many more Middle Eastern stories.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
And what story of the Middle East,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
what story of the world,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
do you want to see

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
reflecting what is said,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
what is expressed in this cylinder?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
The right of peoples

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
to live together in the same state,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
worshiping differently, freely --

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
a Middle East, a world,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
in which religion is not the subject of division

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
or of debate.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
In the world of the Middle East at the moment,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
the debates are, as you know, shrill.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
But I think it's possible

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.260
that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
may well be the voice

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
of this mute thing,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
the Cyrus cylinder.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
Thank you.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.260
(Applause)
