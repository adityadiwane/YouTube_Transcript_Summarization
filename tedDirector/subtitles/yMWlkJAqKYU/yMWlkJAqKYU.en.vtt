00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:15.103
What do you do when you have a headache?

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:17.494
You swallow an aspirin.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.570
But for this pill to get
to your head, where the pain is,

00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:27.971
it goes through your stomach, intestines
and various other organs first.

00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:34.069
Swallowing pills is the most effective
and painless way of delivering

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.095
any medication in the body.

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:42.428
The downside, though, is that swallowing
any medication leads to its dilution.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:48.759
And this is a big problem,
particularly in HIV patients.

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:51.936
When they take their anti-HIV drugs,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.026
these drugs are good for lowering
the virus in the blood,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.269
and increasing the CD4 cell counts.

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:02.983
But they are also notorious
for their adverse side effects,

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:08.500
but mostly bad, because they get diluted
by the time they get to the blood,

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:11.401
and worse, by the time
they get to the sites

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:16.887
where it matters most:
within the HIV viral reservoirs.

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.274
These areas in the body --
such as the lymph nodes,

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:25.183
the nervous system,
as well as the lungs --

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:27.711
where the virus is sleeping,

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:30.943
and will not readily
get delivered in the blood

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:35.994
of patients that are under
consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:40.188
However, upon discontinuation of therapy,

00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:43.869
the virus can awake
and infect new cells in the blood.

00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:51.313
Now, all this is a big problem in treating
HIV with the current drug treatment,

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:55.371
which is a life-long treatment
that must be swallowed by patients.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:57.766
One day, I sat and thought,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.527
"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly
within its reservoir sites,

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.128
without the risk of drug dilution?"

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:11.118
As a laser scientist,
the answer was just before my eyes:

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:12.952
Lasers, of course.

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:15.840
If they can be used for dentistry,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:18.715
for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.444
they can be used for anything imaginable,

00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:24.732
including transporting drugs into cells.

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:30.633
As a matter of fact,
we are currently using laser pulses

00:02:30.657 --> 00:02:34.286
to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.222
which open and close almost
immediately in HIV-infected cells,

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:41.516
in order to deliver drugs within them.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.468
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:51.452
Well, we shine a very powerful
but super-tiny laser beam

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:55.280
onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells

00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:59.355
while these cells are immersed
in liquid containing the drug.

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:05.253
The laser pierces the cell,
while the cell swallows the drug

00:03:05.277 --> 00:03:07.115
in a matter of microseconds.

00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:09.018
Before you even know it,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:12.066
the induced hole
becomes immediately repaired.

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:17.666
Now, we are currently testing
this technology in test tubes

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.197
or in Petri dishes,

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:23.557
but the goal is to get
this technology in the human body,

00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:25.239
apply it in the human body.

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.811
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:32.602
Well, the answer is:
through a three-headed device.

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:36.428
Using the first head, which is our laser,

00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:39.609
we will make an incision
in the site of infection.

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:43.126
Using the second head, which is a camera,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.377
we meander to the site of infection.

00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:50.580
Finally, using a third head,
which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,

00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:53.611
we deliver the drugs directly
at the site of infection,

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:57.736
while the laser is again used
to poke those cells open.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:02.045
Well, this might not seem
like much right now.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.743
But one day, if successful,
this technology can lead

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:10.996
to complete eradication
of HIV in the body.

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.766
Yes. A cure for HIV.

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.061
This is every HIV researcher's dream --

00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:20.612
in our case, a cure lead by lasers.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:21.789
Thank you.

00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:23.748
(Applause)
