00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:19.014
I'm here today to show
my photographs of the Lakota.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.815
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.779
or at least the larger group of tribes,

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.259
called the Sioux.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:29.063
The Lakota are one of many tribes
that were moved off their land

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:30.492
to prisoner-of-war camps,

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.038
now called reservations.

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:34.844
The Pine Ridge Reservation,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.000
the subject of today's slide show,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:41.326
is located about 75 miles southeast
of the Black Hills in South Dakota.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.277
It is sometimes referred to
as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.427
and it is where the Lakota now live.

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.637
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.581
the American Indian Movement,

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.447
or of Russell Means,

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.883
or Leonard Peltier,

00:00:56.883 --> 00:00:58.970
or of the standoff at Oglala,

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:03.131
then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero
for Native issues in the US.

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:06.675
So I've been asked to talk
a little bit today

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.867
about my relationship with the Lakota,

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:10.867
and that's a very difficult one for me,

00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.349
because, if you haven't
noticed from my skin color,

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.762
I'm white,

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.786
and that is a huge barrier
on a Native reservation.

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:21.803
You'll see a lot of people
in my photographs today.

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:25.144
I've become very close with them,
and they've welcomed me like family.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.086
They've called me "brother" and "uncle,"

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.414
and invited me again and again
over five years.

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:30.636
But on Pine Ridge,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.636
I will always be what is called "wasichu."

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.826
"Wasichu" is a Lakota word

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.951
that means "non-Indian,"

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.054
but another version of this word

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:44.298
means "the one who takes
the best meat for himself."

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.488
And that's what I want to focus on --

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.608
the one who takes
the best part of the meat.

00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:50.293
It means "greedy."

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:53.414
So take a look around
this auditorium today.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.190
We are at a private school
in the American West,

00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:59.636
sitting in red velvet chairs

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.072
with money in our pockets.

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.707
And if we look at our lives,

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.609
we have indeed taken
the best part of the meat.

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:10.636
So let's look today
at a set of photographs

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.298
of a people who lost

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:14.299
so that we could gain,

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:16.829
and know that when you see
these people's faces,

00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.168
that these are not just
images of the Lakota;

00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:22.516
they stand for all indigenous people.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.275
On this piece of paper

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.012
is the history the way I learned it
from my Lakota friends and family.

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:37.146
The following is a time line
of treaties made, treaties broken

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.452
and massacres disguised as battles.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:41.635
I'll begin in 1824.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.273
What is known as
the Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.127
was created within the War Department,

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:47.841
setting an early tone of aggression

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:49.904
in our dealings with the Native Americans.

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.471
1851:

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:53.660
The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,

00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:56.422
clearly marking the boundaries
of the Lakota Nation.

00:02:57.017 --> 00:03:00.096
According to the treaty,
those lands are a sovereign nation.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.756
If the boundaries
of this treaty had held --

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.407
and there is a legal basis
that they should --

00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:08.186
then this is what the US
would look like today.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.186
Ten years later.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.302
The Homestead Act,
signed by President Lincoln,

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:18.005
unleashed a flood of white settlers
into Native lands.

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:20.284
1863:

00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:22.806
An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.738
ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,

00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:28.762
the largest mass execution in US history.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:31.534
The execution was ordered
by President Lincoln,

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:36.253
only two days after he signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.401
1866: The beginning
of the Transcontinental Railroad --

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:42.636
a new era.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.213
We appropriated land for trails and trains

00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:47.636
to shortcut through the heart
of the Lakota Nation.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.476
The treaties were out the window.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.967
In response, three tribes led
by the Lakota chief Red Cloud

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.697
attacked and defeated the US army,

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:55.919
many times over.

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:57.268
I want to repeat that part:

00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:59.324
The Lakota defeat the US army.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.879
1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty
clearly guarantees

00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:06.919
the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:09.760
and the Lakotas' ownership
of the sacred Black Hills.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.544
The government also promises
land and hunting rights

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:13.892
in the surrounding states.

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.979
We promise that the Powder River country

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:18.142
will henceforth be closed to all whites.

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.819
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.303
for Red Cloud and the Sioux.

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:25.239
In fact, this is the only war
in American history

00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:28.308
in which the government negotiated a peace

00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:31.003
by conceding everything
demanded by the enemy.

00:04:34.013 --> 00:04:37.755
1869: The Transcontinental
Railroad was completed.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.166
It began carrying, among other things,
large numbers of hunters,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.536
who began the wholesale
killing of buffalo,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.118
eliminating a source of food,
clothing and shelter for the Sioux.

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:48.358
1871:

00:04:48.937 --> 00:04:50.597
The Indian Appropriation Act

00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.960
makes all Indians
wards of the federal government.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.710
In addition, the military issued orders

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:58.598
forbidding western Indians
from leaving reservations.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:03.498
All western Indians at that point in time
were now prisoners of war.

00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:05.610
Also in 1871,

00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:07.611
we ended the time of treaty-making.

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:11.327
The problem with treaties is they allow
tribes to exist as sovereign nations,

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.521
and we can't have that.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:13.742
We had plans.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.037
1874:

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.617
General George Custer announced
the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,

00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:21.326
specifically the Black Hills.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.161
The news of gold creates
a massive influx of white settlers

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:25.370
into Lakota Nation.

00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:28.007
Custer recommends that Congress find a way

00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:30.951
to end the treaties with the Lakota
as soon as possible.

00:05:31.308 --> 00:05:34.341
1875: The Lakota war begins

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:37.017
over the violation
of the Fort Laramie Treaty.

00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:39.012
1876:

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:41.240
On July 26th,

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:43.483
on its way to attack a Lakota village,

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:45.571
Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.244
at the battle of Little Big Horn.

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:49.202
1877:

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:52.889
The great Lakota warrior
and chief named Crazy Horse

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:54.636
surrendered at Fort Robinson.

00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:57.119
He was later killed while in custody.

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.883
1877 is also the year we found a way
to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:09.200
A new agreement was presented
to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:11.636
under a campaign known
as "Sell or Starve" --

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.965
sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.132
Only 10 percent of the adult
male population signed.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:21.565
The Fort Laramie Treaty called
for at least three-quarters of the tribe

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:22.748
to sign away land.

00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:25.342
That clause was obviously ignored.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.521
1887: The Dawes Act.

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:31.636
Communal ownership
of reservation lands ends.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.751
Reservations are cut up
into 160-acre sections,

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.756
and distributed to individual Indians

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.636
with the surplus disposed of.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.479
Tribes lost millions of acres.

00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:43.829
The American dream
of individual land ownership

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:45.848
turned out to be a very clever way

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:48.794
to divide the reservation
until nothing was left.

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:51.147
The move destroyed the reservations,

00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.121
making it easier
to further subdivide and to sell

00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:56.066
with every passing generation.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.130
Most of the surplus land

00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:00.790
and many of the plots
within reservation boundaries

00:07:00.814 --> 00:07:02.780
are now in the hands of white ranchers.

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:06.467
Once again, the fat of the land
goes to wasichu.

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:12.047
1890: A date I believe to be
the most important in this slide show.

00:07:12.428 --> 00:07:14.851
This is the year
of the Wounded Knee Massacre.

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:16.918
On December 29,

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:20.124
US troops surrounded a Sioux
encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:24.197
and massacred Chief Big Foot
and 300 prisoners of war,

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.723
using a new rapid-fire weapon
that fired exploding shells,

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:28.905
called a Hotchkiss gun.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.390
For this so-called "battle,"

00:07:31.414 --> 00:07:34.417
20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor

00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:36.273
were given to the 7th Cavalry.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.963
To this day,

00:07:40.265 --> 00:07:44.373
this is the most Medals of Honor
ever awarded for a single battle.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.899
More Medals of Honor were given

00:07:46.923 --> 00:07:49.453
for the indiscriminate slaughter
of women and children

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:52.349
than for any battle in World War One,

00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:53.714
World War Two,

00:07:53.738 --> 00:07:56.049
Korea, Vietnam,

00:07:56.073 --> 00:07:58.150
Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:03.739
The Wounded Knee Massacre
is considered the end of the Indian wars.

00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:08.562
Whenever I visit the site
of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:12.988
I see it not just as a grave
for the Lakota or for the Sioux,

00:08:13.012 --> 00:08:15.403
but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.030
The holy man Black Elk, said,

00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:23.447
"I did not know then how much was ended.

00:08:24.997 --> 00:08:28.414
When I look back now
from this high hill of my old age,

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:31.019
I can still see
the butchered women and children

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:35.114
lying heaped and scattered
all along the crooked gulch,

00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.946
as plain as when I saw them

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.407
with eyes still young.

00:08:46.262 --> 00:08:49.577
And I can see that something else
died there in the bloody mud

00:08:51.235 --> 00:08:52.931
and was buried in the blizzard.

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:56.600
A people's dream died there.

00:08:57.783 --> 00:08:59.592
And it was a beautiful dream."

00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:03.794
With this event,

00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:06.818
a new era in Native American
history began.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.636
Everything can be measured
before Wounded Knee and after,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.427
because it was in this moment,

00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:17.738
with the fingers on the triggers
of the Hotchkiss guns,

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:21.636
that the US government openly
declared its position on Native rights.

00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:23.636
They were tired of treaties.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.023
They were tired of sacred hills.

00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:27.880
They were tired of ghost dances.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.951
And they were tired of all
the inconveniences of the Sioux.

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:34.190
So they brought out their cannons.

00:09:35.973 --> 00:09:38.300
"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,

00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:39.586
finger on the trigger.

00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:46.982
1900:

00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:51.278
the US Indian population
reached its low point --

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:53.834
less than 250,000,

00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:57.660
compared to an estimated
eight million in 1492.

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:00.939
Fast-forward.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.867
1980:

00:10:03.493 --> 00:10:06.192
The longest-running
court case in US history,

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:08.797
the Sioux Nation versus the United States,

00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.487
was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.

00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:16.056
The court determined that when the Sioux
were resettled onto reservations

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.167
and seven million acres
of their land were opened up

00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:21.241
to prospectors and homesteaders,

00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:23.828
the terms of the second
Fort Laramie Treaty

00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:25.059
had been violated.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.532
The court stated that the Black Hills
were illegally taken,

00:10:29.556 --> 00:10:32.171
and that the initial
offering price, plus interest,

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:33.989
should be paid to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.112
As payment for the Black Hills,

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.568
the court awarded only 106 million dollars
to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:40.592 --> 00:10:43.636
The Sioux refused the money
with the rallying cry,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.636
"The Black Hills are not for sale."

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.049
2010:

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:51.381
Statistics about Native population today,

00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:54.636
more than a century
after the massacre at Wounded Knee,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.245
reveal the legacy of colonization,

00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:58.537
forced migration

00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.004
and treaty violations.

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:03.585
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:06.187
fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.798
The housing office is unable
to build new structures,

00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:11.958
and existing structures are falling apart.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.459
Many are homeless,

00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:16.042
and those with homes
are packed into rotting buildings

00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:17.411
with up to five families.

00:11:17.858 --> 00:11:20.065
Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:21.326
have no electricity.

00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:24.453
At least 60 percent
of the homes on the reservation

00:11:24.477 --> 00:11:26.294
are infested with black mold.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.265
More than 90 percent of the population
lives below the federal poverty line.

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:34.234
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge

00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:37.449
is approximately eight times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:41.105
The infant mortality rate
is the highest on this continent,

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:44.437
and is about three times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:46.856
Cervical cancer is five times higher

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.691
than the US national average.

00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:51.468
The school dropout rate
is up to 70 percent.

00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:56.164
Teacher turnover is eight times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.029
Frequently, grandparents
are raising their grandchildren

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.371
because parents, due to alcoholism,

00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:05.120
domestic violence and general apathy,

00:12:05.144 --> 00:12:06.342
cannot raise them.

00:12:07.342 --> 00:12:10.413
Fifty percent of the population
over the age of 40

00:12:10.437 --> 00:12:11.913
suffers from diabetes.

00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:18.763
The life expectancy for men
is between 46 and 48 years old --

00:12:19.525 --> 00:12:23.528
roughly the same
as in Afghanistan and Somalia.

00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:28.938
The last chapter
in any successful genocide

00:12:28.962 --> 00:12:30.939
is the one in which the oppressor

00:12:30.963 --> 00:12:33.503
can remove their hands and say,

00:12:33.527 --> 00:12:36.989
"My god -- what are these people
doing to themselves?

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:38.709
They're killing each other.

00:12:38.733 --> 00:12:40.636
They're killing themselves

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.309
while we watch them die."

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:46.477
This is how we came to own
these United States.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.254
This is the legacy

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:49.905
of Manifest Destiny.

00:12:50.713 --> 00:12:54.940
Prisoners are still born
into prisoner of war camps,

00:12:54.964 --> 00:12:56.926
long after the guards are gone.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:04.352
These are the bones
left after the best meat has been taken.

00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:08.469
A long time ago,

00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:10.470
a series of events was set in motion

00:13:10.494 --> 00:13:13.996
by a people who look like me, by wasichu,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.479
eager to take the land and the water
and the gold in the hills.

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:21.546
Those events led to a domino effect
that has yet to end.

00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:26.027
As removed as we,
the dominant society, may feel

00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:30.007
from a massacre in 1890,

00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:33.757
or a series of broken
treaties 150 years ago,

00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:36.392
I still have to ask you the question:

00:13:37.344 --> 00:13:39.971
How should you feel
about the statistics of today?

00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:44.302
What is the connection
between these images of suffering

00:13:44.326 --> 00:13:46.302
and the history that I just read to you?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.040
And how much of this history
do you need to own, even?

00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:52.990
Is any of this your responsibility today?

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:57.226
I have been told that there must be
something we can do.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.676
There must be some call to action.

00:14:00.957 --> 00:14:04.032
Because for so long,
I've been standing on the sidelines,

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.095
content to be a witness,

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:07.983
just taking photographs.

00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:11.520
Because the solutions
seem so far in the past,

00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:14.877
I needed nothing short
of a time machine to access them.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.048
The suffering of indigenous peoples
is not a simple issue to fix.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.916
It's not something everyone can get behind

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.789
the way they get behind helping Haiti,

00:14:25.813 --> 00:14:28.216
or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:30.965
The "fix," as it's called,

00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:33.636
may be much more difficult
for the dominant society

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.957
than, say, a $50 check

00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:39.278
or a church trip to paint
some graffiti-covered houses,

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:40.913
or a suburban family

00:14:40.937 --> 00:14:43.913
donating a box of clothes
they don't even want anymore.

00:14:44.556 --> 00:14:45.951
So where does that leave us?

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:48.500
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.950
The United States continues
on a daily basis to violate the terms

00:14:54.974 --> 00:14:59.423
of the 1851 and 1868
Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.315
The call to action I offer today --

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.201
my TED wish -- is this:

00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:07.892
Honor the treaties.

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.182
Give back the Black Hills.

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:12.821
It's not your business
what they do with them.

00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:22.037
(Applause)
