00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I am a reformed marketer,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and I now work in international development.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
which is the [second] largest country in Africa.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The DRC is a dangerous place.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
In the past 10 years, five million people have died

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
due to a war in the east.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
But war isn't the only reason

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that life is difficult in the DRC.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
There are many health issues as well.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
is 1.3 percent among adults.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
This might not sound like a large number,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
but in a country with 76 million people,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
it means there are 930,000 that are infected.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And due to the poor infrastructure,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
only 25 percent of those

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Which is why, in part,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
donor agencies provide condoms

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
at low or no cost.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And so while I was in the DRC,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
including Damien.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
so it's not a place that you stay.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now Damien knows all about condoms,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but he doesn't sell them.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
He said there's just not in demand.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
It's not surprising,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
because only three percent of people in the DRC

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
use condoms.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Joseph and Christine,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
their customers don't buy the branded versions.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
They like the generics.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And as a marketer, I found that curious.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And it turns out that there are three main messages

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
used by the donor agencies for these condoms:

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
fear, financing and fidelity.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
or Trust.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
They package it with the red ribbon

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that reminds us of HIV,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
show pictures of your wife or husband

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and tell you to protect them

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
or to act prudently.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
just before they go get a condom.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
(Laughter)

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
What is it that you think about

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
just before you get a condom?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Sex!

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
they understand this.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Their marketing is slightly different.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
The name might not be much different,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
but the imagery sure is.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Some brands are aspirational,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And this made me think

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
on a key aspect of marketing:

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
understanding who's the audience.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And for donor agencies, unfortunately,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
the audience tends to be

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
It's people back home,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
people that support their work,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
people like these.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
But if what we're really trying to do

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
is stop the spread of HIV,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
we need to think about the customer,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
the people whose behavior needs to change --

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
the couples,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
the young women, the young men --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
whose lives depend on it.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And so the lesson is this:

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
it doesn't really matter what you're selling;

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
you just have to think about who is your customer,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and what are the messages

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
that are going to get them to change their behavior.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
It might just save their lives.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Thank you.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
(Applause)
