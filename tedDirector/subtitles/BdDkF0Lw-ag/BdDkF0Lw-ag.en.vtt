00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:19.868
Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:24.567
of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.564
That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:30.629
(Laughter)

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:35.202
I said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:40.357
He said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:42.378
So, yeah.

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:46.375
Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.110
Let's go back before Christ, three millennia,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.477
to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:58.504
the march against inequality and poverty really began.

00:00:58.504 --> 00:00:59.987
Three thousand years ago,

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:03.040
civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.945
some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.853
smelling of sheep shit, I guess,

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:14.432
proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:19.916
"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:23.297
And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:26.565
You, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:30.377
And they say, "No, no, that's what it says here

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:32.388
in our holy book."

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:35.216
Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids,

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.454
another people spreading the same idea

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:39.445
of equality with a different book.

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:43.004
This time it's called the Facebook.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.896
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.309
They turn a social network from virtual to actual,

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:50.799
and kind of rebooted the 21st century.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.282
Not to undersell how messy and ugly

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:56.030
the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.805
neither to oversell the role of technology,

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.172
but these things have given a sense of what's possible

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:06.531
when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.343
gets turned upside down, putting the people on top

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:13.143
and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:16.218
It's also shown us that something as powerful

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:20.243
as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:23.206
because facts, like people,

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:25.556
want to be free, and when they're free,

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:27.227
liberty is usually around the corner,

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:29.899
even for the poorest of the poor --

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.444
facts that can challenge cynicism

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.326
and the apathy that leads to inertia,

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.160
facts that tell us what's working and,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.893
more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.443
facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us

00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:45.977
meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made

00:02:45.977 --> 00:02:48.502
back in 2005,

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.190
when he asked us to be that great generation

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.253
that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,

00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:56.228
extreme poverty,

00:02:56.228 --> 00:03:00.327
facts that build a powerful momentum.

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:02.915
So I thought, forget the rock opera,

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:08.041
forget the bombast, my usual tricks.

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:12.065
The only thing singing today would be the facts,

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:17.503
for I have truly embraced by inner nerd.

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:23.791
So exit the rock star.

00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:32.951
Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.615
Because what the facts are telling us

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:40.892
is that the long, slow journey,

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.184
humanity's long, slow journey of equality,

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:44.947
is actually speeding up.

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:47.031
Look at what's been achieved.

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:50.381
Look at the pictures these data sets print.

00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:53.305
Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:55.199
there are eight million more AIDS patients

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.930
getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.167
Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.818
that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:08.498
For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.918
it's down by 2.65 million a year.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:18.531
That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:23.781
Wow. Wow. (Applause)

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:26.069
Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.899
Have you read anything anywhere in the last week

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:34.219
that is remotely as important as that number? Wow.

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.207
Great news. It drives me nuts

00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:41.095
that most people don't seem to know this news.

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:43.954
Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:46.632
This is Michael and Benedicta,

00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:49.283
and they're alive thanks in large part

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:53.168
to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing --

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:56.154
and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:57.690
whether you know it or not.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.608
And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs

00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:04.246
that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:07.421
This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.

00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.296
It was fought for, it was campaigned for,

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.967
it was innovated for.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:16.196
And this great news gives birth to even more great news,

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.076
because the historic trend is this.

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:21.684
The number of people living in back-breaking,

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:24.271
soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined

00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:29.361
from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.265
to 33 percent by 2000

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:37.036
and then to 21 percent by 2010.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:41.299
Give it up for that. (Applause)

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.437
Halved. Halved.

00:05:44.437 --> 00:05:48.737
Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people

00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:50.715
unnecessarily losing their lives.

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:51.836
There's still work to do.

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:57.488
But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.

00:05:57.488 --> 00:06:01.968
And if you live on less than $1.25 a day,

00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:04.116
if you live in that kind of poverty,

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.018
this is not just data.

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:07.897
This is everything.

00:06:07.897 --> 00:06:13.696
If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am --

00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:19.026
this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:21.895
And guess what? If the trajectory continues,

00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:26.432
look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day

00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:30.064
gets to by 2030.

00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:33.376
Can't be true, can it?

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:37.764
That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:42.905
we get to, wow, the zero zone.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.380
For number-crunchers like us,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.889
that is the erogenous zone,

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.080
and it's fair to say that I am, by now,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.129
sexually aroused by the collating of data.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:01.390
So virtual elimination of extreme poverty,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.990
as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.387
adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:12.404
We do love a good baseline.

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:14.125
That's amazing.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:18.025
Now I know that some of you think this progress

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.716
is all in Asia or Latin America or

00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:22.048
model countries like Brazil --

00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:24.940
and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? --

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.050
but look at sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.725
There's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,

00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:35.453
who in the last decade have had a combination

00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:36.997
of 100 percent debt cancellation,

00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:39.738
a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI --

00:07:39.738 --> 00:07:41.193
that's foreign direct investment --

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:45.115
which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that's local money --

00:07:45.115 --> 00:07:47.779
which, when spent wisely -- that's good governance --

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.049
cut childhood mortality by a third,

00:07:50.049 --> 00:07:51.756
doubled education completion rates,

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:54.860
and they, too, halved extreme poverty,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.289
and at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.542
So the pride of lions

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:04.258
is the proof of concept.

00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:07.689
There are all kinds of benefits to this.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:10.877
For a start, you won't have to listen

00:08:10.877 --> 00:08:15.229
to an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:20.437
How about that? (Applause)

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:24.475
And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:28.756
I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.

00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:34.083
(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:37.770
Makes us look really young.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.796
So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?

00:08:40.796 --> 00:08:44.507
Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:48.321
We can't get this done until we really accept

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.796
that we can get this done.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:53.049
Look at this graph.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:57.867
It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.

00:08:57.867 --> 00:08:59.741
And the next one is really beautiful.

00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:03.274
It's called momentum.

00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:07.830
And it's how we can bend the arc of history

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.458
down towards zero,

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:11.857
just doing the things that we know work.

00:09:11.857 --> 00:09:13.902
So inertia versus momentum.

00:09:13.902 --> 00:09:16.443
There is jeopardy, and of course,

00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:18.815
the closer you get, it gets harder.

00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:20.759
We know the obstacles that are in our way

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.784
right now, in difficult times.

00:09:22.784 --> 00:09:27.925
In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,

00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:30.500
some who mind the nation's purse want to cut

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.905
life-saving programs like the Global Fund.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.718
But you can do something about that.

00:09:34.718 --> 00:09:36.702
You can tell politicians

00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:39.608
that these cuts [can cost] lives.

00:09:39.608 --> 00:09:43.185
Right now today, in Oslo as it happens,

00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:45.552
oil companies are fighting to keep secret

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.030
their payments to governments

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.747
for extracting oil in developing countries.

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:52.466
You can do something about that too.

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.326
You can join the One Campaign,

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:58.679
and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:02.502
We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:04.974
of the wealth under the ground

00:10:04.974 --> 00:10:08.545
ends up in the hands of the people living above it.

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:12.312
And right now, we know

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:16.024
that the biggest disease of all

00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:18.987
is not a disease. It's corruption.

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:20.811
But there's a vaccine for that too.

00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:24.302
It's called transparency, open data sets,

00:10:24.302 --> 00:10:29.313
something the TED community is really on it.

00:10:29.313 --> 00:10:32.925
Daylight, you could call it, transparency.

00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:35.487
And technology is really turbocharging this.

00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:40.238
It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:43.220
So let me tell you about the U-report,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.827
which I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:49.162
all across Uganda, young people

00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:53.538
armed with 2G phones, an SMS social network

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:56.604
exposing government corruption

00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:59.200
and demanding to know what's in the budget

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.063
and how their money is being spent.

00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:04.738
This is exciting stuff.

00:11:04.738 --> 00:11:08.101
Look, once you have these tools,

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.825
you can't not use them.

00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:12.351
Once you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.

00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:15.626
You can't delete this data from your brain,

00:11:15.626 --> 00:11:18.449
but you can delete the cliched image

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:20.687
of supplicant, impoverished peoples

00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:22.759
not taking control of their own lives.

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:25.141
You can erase that, you really can,

00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:30.618
because it's not true anymore. (Applause)

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:33.470
It's transformational.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.343
2030? By 2030, robots,

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:40.137
not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.

00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:42.271
By the time we get there,

00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:45.400
every place with a rough semblance of governance

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.430
might actually be on their way.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.235
So I'm here to -- I guess we're here

00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:58.743
to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,

00:11:58.743 --> 00:12:00.793
the one we call factivism.

00:12:00.793 --> 00:12:02.437
It's not going to kill you.

00:12:02.437 --> 00:12:06.530
In fact, it could save countless lives.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.209
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:14.246
to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:19.456
By doing so, you will join us and countless others

00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:24.419
in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:28.657
the ever-demanding journey of equality.

00:12:28.657 --> 00:12:31.894
Could we really be the great generation

00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:33.855
that Mandela asked us to be?

00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:37.835
Might we answer that clarion call with science,

00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:40.494
with reason, with facts,

00:12:40.494 --> 00:12:44.532
and, dare I say it, emotions?

00:12:44.532 --> 00:12:50.664
Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.

00:12:50.664 --> 00:12:53.151
I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.

00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.426
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups

00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:59.529
behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.079
He got thrown in jail for it,

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:05.802
but I have his words tattooed on my brain.

00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:10.289
"We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:13.414
We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

00:13:13.414 --> 00:13:16.702
We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.

00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:18.673
We are going to win because the tears

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.779
that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:24.643
We are going to win because we have dreams,

00:13:24.643 --> 00:13:28.153
and we're willing to stand up for those dreams."

00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:30.466
Wael is right.

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:32.328
We're going to win

00:13:32.328 --> 00:13:34.560
if we work together as one,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.004
because the power of the people

00:13:37.004 --> 00:13:40.828
is so much stronger than the people in power.

00:13:40.828 --> 00:13:44.278
Thank you.

00:13:44.278 --> 00:13:47.150
(Applause)

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.150
Thank you so much. (Applause)
