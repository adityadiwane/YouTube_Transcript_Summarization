00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm here to give you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
your recommended dietary allowance

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
of poetry.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And the way I'm going to do that

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
is present to you

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
five animations

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
of five of my poems.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Because the mixing of those two media

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
But when I was United States Poet Laureate --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and I love saying that.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
(Laughter)

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's a great way to start sentences.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
When I was him back then,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and they were hired

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
sort of by the Sundance Channel.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and then they would find animators

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
to animate them.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And I was initially resistant,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
because I always think

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
poetry can stand alone by itself.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Attempts to put my poems to music

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
have had disastrous results,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
in all cases.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And the poem, if it's written with the ear,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
already has been set to its own verbal music

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
as it was composed.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And surely, if you're reading a poem

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
that mentions a cow,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
you don't need on the facing page

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
a drawing of a cow.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
since childhood.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I think more influential

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
on my imagination

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and Loony Tunes cartoons.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Bugs Bunny is my muse.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
poetry on buses, poetry on subways,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
on billboards, on cereal boxes.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
When I was Poet Laureate, there I go again --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I can't help it, it's true --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
(Laughter)

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that lasted for a couple of years.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And my sense is,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and more into public life.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
or on a cereal box or whatever,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
it happens to you so suddenly

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that you don't have time

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that were installed in high school.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So let us start with the first one.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
It's a little poem called "Budapest,"

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and in it I reveal,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
or pretend to reveal,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
the secrets of the creative process.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
(Video) Narration: "Budapest."

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
My pen moves along the page

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
like the snout of a strange animal

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
shaped like a human arm

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and dressed in the sleeve

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
of a loose green sweater.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
intent as any forager

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that has nothing on its mind

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
but the grubs and insects

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that will allow it to live another day.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It wants only to be here tomorrow,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
dressed perhaps

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in the sleeve of a plaid shirt,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
nose pressed against the page,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
writing a few more dutiful lines

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
while I gaze out the window

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and imagine Budapest

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
or some other city

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
where I have never been.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Applause)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.260
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
which I found both erroneous and profound.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
(Laughter)

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
He says that, "If at first you don't succeed,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
hide all evidence you ever tried."

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
(Laughter)

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
The next poem is also rather short.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And it uses the imagery

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
of dollhouse furniture.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
(Video) Narration: "Some Days."

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Some days

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I put the people in their places at the table,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
bend their legs at the knees,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
if they come with that feature,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
All afternoon they face one another,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
the man in the brown suit,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the woman in the blue dress --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.260
perfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
But other days I am the one

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
who is lifted up by the ribs

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to sit with the others at the long table.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Very funny.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
But how would you like it

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
if you never knew from one day to the next

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
if you were going to spend it

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
striding around like a vivid god,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
your shoulders in the clouds,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
or sitting down there

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
amidst the wallpaper

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
staring straight ahead

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
with your little plastic face?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.260
(Applause)

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
The next poem is called forgetfulness,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and it's really just a kind of poetic essay

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.260
on the subject of mental slippage.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And the poem begins

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
with a certain species of forgetfulness

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that someone called

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
literary amnesia,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.260
in other words, forgetting the things that you have read.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
The name of the author is the first to go,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
followed obediently

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
by the title, the plot,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
the heartbreaking conclusion,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
the entire novel,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
which suddenly becomes one you have never read,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
never even heard of.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
It is as if, one by one,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
the memories you used to harbor

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to a little fishing village

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
where there are no phones.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Long ago,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and you watched the quadratic equation

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
pack its bag.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And even now,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
as you memorize the order of the planets,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
something else is slipping away,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
a state flower perhaps,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
the address of an uncle,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the capital of Paraguay.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Whatever it is

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
you are struggling to remember,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
not even lurking

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
in some obscure corner

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
of your spleen.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
It has floated away

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
down a dark mythological river

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
whose name begins with an L

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
as far as you can recall,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
well on your own way to oblivion

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
where you will join those

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
who have forgotten even how to swim

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and how to ride a bicycle.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
to look up the date of a famous battle

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
in a book on war.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
No wonder the Moon in the window

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
seems to have drifted out of a love poem

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
that you used to know by heart.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:35.260
(Applause)

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
BC: The next poem is called "The Country"

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and it's based on,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
when I was in college

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
I lived in New York City.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And we would visit each other.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And when I would go up to the country,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
he would teach me things like deer hunting,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
which meant getting lost with a gun basically --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
(Laughter)

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
and trout fishing and stuff like that.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And then he'd come down to New York City

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and I'd teach him what I knew,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
which was largely smoking and drinking.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
(Laughter)

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And in that way we traded lore with each other.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
The poem that's coming up

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is based on him trying to tell me a little something

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
about a domestic point of etiquette

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in country living

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
It's called "The Country."

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
(Video) Narration: "The Country."

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
I wondered about you

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
when you told me never to leave

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
just lying around the house,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
because the mice might get into them

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and start a fire.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
But your face was absolutely straight

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
when you twisted the lid down

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
on the round tin

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
where the matches, you said, are always stowed.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Who could sleep that night?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Who could whisk away the thought

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
of the one unlikely mouse

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
padding along a cold water pipe

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
behind the floral wallpaper,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
gripping a single wooden match

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
between the needles of his teeth?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Who could not see him rounding a corner,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
the sudden flare

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and the creature, for one bright, shining moment,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
suddenly thrust ahead of his time --

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
now a fire-starter,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
now a torch-bearer

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
in a forgotten ritual,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
little brown druid

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
illuminating some ancient night?

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And who could fail to notice,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
lit up in the blazing insulation,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
the tiny looks of wonderment

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
on the faces of his fellow mice --

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
one-time inhabitants

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
of what once was your house in the country?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
(Applause)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
BC: Thank you.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
(Applause)

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Thank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I wrote this after a friend's funeral,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
as all eulogists tend to do,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
which is how happy the deceased would be

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
to look down and see all of us assembled.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So the little poem is called "The Dead."

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
(Video) Narration: "The Dead."

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
The dead are always looking down on us,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
they say.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
they are looking down

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
through the glass-bottom boats of heaven

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
as they row themselves slowly

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
through eternity.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
They watch the tops of our heads

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
moving below on Earth.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And when we lie down

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
in a field or on a couch,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
drugged perhaps

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
by the hum of a warm afternoon,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
they think we are looking back at them,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
which makes them lift their oars

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and fall silent

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and wait like parents

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
for us to close our eyes.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.260
(Applause)

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
It took a long time --

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage --

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
a long time to put those two together.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
But then again, it took us a long time

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
to put the wheel and the suitcase together.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
(Laughter)

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
(Laughter)

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
I just have time

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
to read a more recent poem to you.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
If it has a subject,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
the subject is adolescence.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And it's addressed to a certain person.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:58.260
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
on the day you were born,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
you would be all done in only one more year?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So never mind;

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
you're fine just being yourself.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
You're loved for just being you.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
But did you know that at your age

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room --

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.260
no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Of course, there will be time for all that

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
later in your life,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
after you come out of your room

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and begin to blossom,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.260
or at least pick up all your socks.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
For some reason I keep remembering

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
when she was only 15.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
(Laughter)

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
A few centuries later,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
when he was your age,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
but that did not keep him

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
from composing two symphonies, four operas

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and two complete masses as a youngster.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
(Laughter)

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
But of course, that was in Austria

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
at the height of Romantic lyricism,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
(Laughter)

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Frankly, who cares

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.260
or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We think you're special just being you --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
playing with your food and staring into space.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
(Laughter)

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
By the way,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
I lied about Schubert doing the dishes,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
(Laughter)

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
(Applause)

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.260
(Applause)

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Thanks.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
(Applause)
