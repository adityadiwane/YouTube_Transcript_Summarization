00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.181
How can I speak in 10 minutes

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.749
about the bonds of women
over three generations,

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:24.824
about how the astonishing
strength of those bonds

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:27.734
took hold in the life
of a four-year-old girl

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:33.316
huddled with her young sister,
her mother and her grandmother

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.166
for five days and nights
in a small boat in the China Sea

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.507
more than 30 years ago.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.287
Bonds that took hold
in the life of that small girl

00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:43.475
and never let go --

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.365
that small girl now
living in San Francisco

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:48.949
and speaking to you today.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.981
This is not a finished story.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.454
It is a jigsaw puzzle
still being put together.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:58.366
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:04.072
Imagine the first piece:
a man burning his life's work.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.203
He is a poet, a playwright,

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:09.509
a man whose whole life

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.609
had been balanced on the single hope
of his country's unity and freedom.

00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:17.801
Imagine him as the communists
enter Saigon --

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:21.235
confronting the fact
that his life had been a complete waste.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.552
Words, for so long his friends,
now mocked him.

00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.236
He retreated into silence.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.138
He died broken by history.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.236
He is my grandfather.

00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:36.114
I never knew him in real life.

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.804
But our lives are much more
than our memories.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.236
My grandmother never
let me forget his life.

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:48.042
My duty was not to allow
it to have been in vain,

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.546
and my lesson was to learn
that, yes, history tried to crush us,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.720
but we endured.

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:58.791
The next piece of the jigsaw
is of a boat in the early dawn

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:00.801
slipping silently out to sea.

00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.864
My mother, Mai, was 18
when her father died --

00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:07.764
already in an arranged marriage,

00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:09.753
already with two small girls.

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.883
For her, life had distilled
itself into one task:

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:17.615
the escape of her family
and a new life in Australia.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.831
It was inconceivable to her
that she would not succeed.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.836
So after a four-year saga
that defies fiction,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.085
a boat slipped out to sea
disguised as a fishing vessel.

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:32.490
All the adults knew the risks.

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:36.760
The greatest fear
was of pirates, rape and death.

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.148
Like most adults on the boat,

00:02:40.172 --> 00:02:42.444
my mother carried
a small bottle of poison.

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:47.002
If we were captured,
first my sister and I,

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:49.152
then she and my grandmother would drink.

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:52.795
My first memories are from the boat --

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.318
the steady beat of the engine,

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.605
the bow dipping into each wave,

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.236
the vast and empty horizon.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.808
I don't remember the pirates
who came many times,

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:06.893
but were bluffed by the bravado
of the men on our boat,

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:11.302
or the engine dying
and failing to start for six hours.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.408
But I do remember the lights
on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:19.777
and the young man who collapsed and died,

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:21.994
the journey's end too much for him,

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.965
and the first apple I tasted,
given to me by the men on the rig.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:30.295
No apple has ever tasted the same.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:37.126
After three months in a refugee camp,
we landed in Melbourne.

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:40.027
And the next piece of the jigsaw
is about four women

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:43.549
across three generations
shaping a new life together.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.398
We settled in Footscray,

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:51.235
a working-class suburb
whose demographic is layers of immigrants.

00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:56.072
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,
whose existence I was oblivious of,

00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:58.670
there was no sense
of entitlement in Footscray.

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:02.345
The smells from shop doors
were from the rest of the world.

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.053
And the snippets of halting English

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.309
were exchanged between people
who had one thing in common:

00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:09.093
They were starting again.

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:12.548
My mother worked on farms,

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:14.210
then on a car assembly line,

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:16.551
working six days, double shifts.

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:19.502
Somehow, she found time to study English

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.497
and gain IT qualifications.

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:23.664
We were poor.

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:26.376
All the dollars were allocated

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.798
and extra tuition in English
and mathematics was budgeted for

00:04:29.822 --> 00:04:31.574
regardless of what missed out,

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:34.798
which was usually new clothes;

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.213
they were always secondhand.

00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:39.587
Two pairs of stockings for school,

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.591
each to hide the holes in the other.

00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:46.246
A school uniform down to the ankles,
because it had to last for six years.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:51.977
And there were rare
but searing chants of "slit-eye"

00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.731
and the occasional graffiti:

00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:55.025
"Asian, go home."

00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:57.236
Go home to where?

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.046
Something stiffened inside me.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.651
There was a gathering of resolve
and a quiet voice saying,

00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:05.397
"I will bypass you."

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:10.747
My mother, my sister and I
slept in the same bed.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.148
My mother was exhausted each night,

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:16.229
but we told one another about our day

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:19.843
and listened to the movements
of my grandmother around the house.

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:23.202
My mother suffered from nightmares,
all about the boat.

00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:27.762
And my job was to stay awake
until her nightmares came

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:28.957
so I could wake her.

00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:33.113
She opened a computer store,

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.966
then studied to be a beautician
and opened another business.

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:38.518
And the women came with their stories

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.178
about men who could not
make the transition,

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:42.956
angry and inflexible,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.805
and troubled children
caught between two worlds.

00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:48.437
Grants and sponsors were sought.

00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:49.967
Centers were established.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.951
I lived in parallel worlds.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.378
In one, I was the classic Asian student,

00:05:56.402 --> 00:05:58.919
relentless in the demands
that I made on myself.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.925
In the other, I was enmeshed
in lives that were precarious,

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.678
tragically scarred by violence,
drug abuse and isolation.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.017
But so many over the years were helped.

00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:12.953
And for that work,
when I was a final-year law student,

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:15.538
I was chosen as the Young
Australian of the Year.

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:19.490
And I was catapulted from
one piece of the jigsaw to another,

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:21.236
and their edges didn't fit.

00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:24.320
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,

00:06:24.344 --> 00:06:27.673
was now Tan Le,
refugee and social activist,

00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:31.118
invited to speak in venues
she had never heard of

00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:34.636
and into homes whose existence
she could never have imagined.

00:06:35.573 --> 00:06:37.229
I didn't know the protocols.

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.445
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.

00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:42.740
I didn't know how to talk about wine.

00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:45.474
I didn't know how to talk about anything.

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:49.613
I wanted to retreat
to the routines and comfort

00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:52.235
of life in an unsung suburb --

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.367
a grandmother, a mother and two daughters

00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:59.080
ending each day as they had
for almost 20 years,

00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:01.556
telling one another the story of their day

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.120
and falling asleep,
the three of us still in the same bed.

00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:09.418
I told my mother I couldn't do it.

00:07:10.974 --> 00:07:14.422
She reminded me that I was now
the same age she had been

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:15.890
when we boarded the boat.

00:07:16.808 --> 00:07:18.588
"No" had never been an option.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.466
"Just do it," she said,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.168
"and don't be what you're not."

00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:27.621
So I spoke out on youth
unemployment and education

00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:30.723
and the neglect of the marginalized
and disenfranchised.

00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:34.501
And the more candidly I spoke,
the more I was asked to speak.

00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:38.589
I met people from all walks of life,

00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:41.163
so many of them doing
the thing they loved,

00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:43.236
living on the frontiers of possibility.

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:46.236
And even though I finished my degree,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.557
I realized I could not settle
into a career in law.

00:07:49.937 --> 00:07:52.236
There had to be another piece
of the jigsaw.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.538
And I realized, at the same time,

00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:58.210
that it is OK to be an outsider,

00:07:58.234 --> 00:07:59.972
a recent arrival,

00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:01.236
new on the scene --

00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:03.613
and not just OK,

00:08:03.637 --> 00:08:05.907
but something to be thankful for,

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:07.619
perhaps a gift from the boat.

00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:13.126
Because being an insider can so easily
mean collapsing the horizons,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.730
can so easily mean accepting
the presumptions of your province.

00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:20.635
I have stepped outside
my comfort zone enough now

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:23.379
to know that, yes,
the world does fall apart,

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.236
but not in the way that you fear.

00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:28.093
Possibilities that would not
have been allowed

00:08:28.117 --> 00:08:29.878
were outrageously encouraged.

00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:31.771
There was an energy there,

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:33.236
an implacable optimism,

00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:36.546
a strange mixture of humility and daring.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:38.991
So I followed my hunches.

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:41.823
I gathered around me
a small team of people

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:45.492
for whom the label "It can't be done"
was an irresistible challenge.

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:48.236
For a year, we were penniless.

00:08:48.672 --> 00:08:51.014
At the end of each day,
I made a huge pot of soup

00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:52.411
which we all shared.

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:55.094
We worked well into each night.

00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:57.235
Most of our ideas were crazy,

00:08:57.873 --> 00:08:59.236
but a few were brilliant,

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.038
and we broke through.

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:06.114
I made the decision to move
to the US after only one trip.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.236
My hunches again.

00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:12.769
Three months later, I had relocated,
and the adventure has continued.

00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:17.976
Before I close, though,
let me tell you about my grandmother.

00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:22.901
She grew up at a time when Confucianism
was the social norm

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:25.496
and the local mandarin
was the person who mattered.

00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:28.236
Life hadn't changed for centuries.

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:32.000
Her father died soon after she was born.

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:34.690
Her mother raised her alone.

00:09:35.952 --> 00:09:40.642
At 17, she became the second wife
of a mandarin whose mother beat her.

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:43.985
With no support from her husband,

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:46.715
she caused a sensation
by taking him to court

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:48.971
and prosecuting her own case,

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:51.722
and a far greater sensation when she won.

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:53.236
(Laughter)

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.307
(Applause)

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.720
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:06.913
I was taking a shower
in a hotel room in Sydney

00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:08.496
the moment she died,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.028
600 miles away, in Melbourne.

00:10:12.363 --> 00:10:16.494
I looked through the shower screen
and saw her standing on the other side.

00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:18.493
I knew she had come to say goodbye.

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:21.063
My mother phoned minutes later.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:23.866
A few days later,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.235
we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray
and sat around her casket.

00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:31.655
We told her stories and assured her
that we were still with her.

00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:37.681
At midnight, the monk came
and told us he had to close the casket.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:41.052
My mother asked us to feel her hand.

00:10:41.814 --> 00:10:43.236
She asked the monk,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.701
"Why is it that her hand is so warm
and the rest of her is so cold?"

00:10:48.938 --> 00:10:52.236
"Because you have been holding it
since this morning," he said.

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:54.478
"You have not let it go."

00:10:57.502 --> 00:11:01.311
If there is a sinew in our family,
it runs through the women.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.313
Given who we were
and how life had shaped us,

00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:08.679
we can now see that the men
that might have come into our lives

00:11:08.703 --> 00:11:10.019
would have thwarted us.

00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.606
Defeat would have come too easily.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.775
Now I would like to have my own children,
and I wonder about the boat.

00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:21.123
Who could ever wish it on their own?

00:11:22.197 --> 00:11:24.343
Yet I am afraid of privilege,

00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:25.573
of ease,

00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:26.833
of entitlement.

00:11:27.717 --> 00:11:31.730
Can I give them a bow in their lives,
dipping bravely into each wave,

00:11:32.778 --> 00:11:35.236
the unperturbed and steady
beat of the engine,

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:38.896
the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:41.896
I don't know.

00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:43.889
But if I could give it

00:11:43.913 --> 00:11:46.227
and still see them safely through,

00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:47.401
I would.

00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:55.585
(Applause)

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:04.618
Trevor Neilson: And also,
Tan's mother is here today,

00:12:04.642 --> 00:12:06.236
in the fourth or fifth row.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.052
(Applause)
