00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:15.146
So if I was to ask you

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.560
what the connection between

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:19.832
a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,

00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:21.496
you'd probably think
that's the easiest question

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.276
that you're going to be asked
in Edinburgh all week.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.915
But if I was to say
that they're both examples

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.144
of alternative or new forms of currency

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:33.682
in a hyperconnected,
data-driven global economy,

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:37.211
you'd probably think
I was a little bit bonkers.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.778
But trust me, I work in advertising.

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:41.811
(Laughter)

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:43.870
And I am going to tell you the answer,

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:46.480
but obviously after this short break.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.389
So a more challenging question is one

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:50.272
that I was asked, actually,
by one of our writers

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:52.773
a couple of weeks ago,
and I didn't know the answer:

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.013
What's the world's best
performing currency?

00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:56.923
It's actually Bitcoin.

00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:59.138
Now, for those of you
who may not be familiar,

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:02.596
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual
currency, synthetic currency.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.402
It was founded in 2008
by this anonymous programmer

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:09.270
using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:11.641
No one knows who or what he is.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.902
He's almost like the Banksy
of the Internet.

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:17.010
And I'm probably not going
to do it proper service here,

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:19.177
but my interpretation
of how it works is that

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:21.960
Bitcoins are released
through this process of mining.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:24.508
So there's a network
of computers that are challenged

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:26.662
to solve a very complex
mathematical problem

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.928
and the person that manages to solve
it first gets the Bitcoins.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:30.914
And the Bitcoins are released,

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.558
they're put into a public
ledger called the Blockchain,

00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:36.211
and then they float, so
they become a currency,

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.258
and completely decentralized,
that's the sort of

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:41.806
scary thing about this,
which is why it's so popular.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.282
So it's not run
by the authorities or the state.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.359
It's actually managed by the network.

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.622
And the reason that it's proved
very successful

00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:52.040
is it's private, it's anonymous,
it's fast, and it's cheap.

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:55.832
And you do get to the point where
there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.

00:01:55.856 --> 00:01:58.747
So in one level it went
from something like 13 dollars

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.339
to 266, literally
in the space of four months,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:04.078
and then crashed and lost half
of its value in six hours.

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:05.912
And it's currently around that kind of

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.392
110 dollar mark in value.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:11.188
But what it does show
is that it's sort of gaining ground,

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:12.115
it's gaining respectability.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.211
You get services,
like Reddit and Wordpress

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.506
are actually accepting Bitcoin
as a payment currency now.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.449
And that's showing you that people

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.000
are actually placing trust in technology,

00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:24.760
and it's started to trump and disrupt

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:26.805
and interrogate traditional institutions

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.544
and how we think
about currencies and money.

00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:30.992
And that's not surprising,
if you think about

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.912
the basket case that is the E.U.

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:35.127
I think there was a Gallup
survey out recently

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.113
that said something like, in America,

00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:40.887
trust in banks is at an all-time
low, it's something like 21 percent.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.702
And you can see here
some photographs from London

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:44.917
where Barclays sponsored
the city bike scheme,

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.524
and some activists have
done some nice piece

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:49.472
of guerrilla marketing here
and doctored the slogans.

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:52.969
"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclays
takes you for a ride."

00:02:52.993 --> 00:02:56.672
These are the more polite ones
I could share with you today.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:59.125
But you get the gist, so
people have really started

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.648
to sort of lose faith in institutions.

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:03.696
There's a P.R. company called Edelman,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.959
they do this very interesting
survey every year

00:03:05.983 --> 00:03:09.154
precisely around trust
and what people are thinking.

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:11.896
And this is a global survey,
so these numbers are global.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.159
And what's interesting
is that you can see that

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:16.763
hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,

00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:18.549
and it's all about heterarchical now,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.113
so people trust people
like themselves more

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.197
than they trust corporations
and governments.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.380
And if you look at these figures
for the more developed markets

00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:29.108
like U.K., Germany, and so on,
they're actually much lower.

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:30.119
And I find that sort of scary.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.191
People are actually
trusting businesspeople

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:35.620
more than they're trusting
governments and leaders.

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:38.727
So what's starting to happen,
if you think about money,

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.936
if you sort of boil money
down to an essence,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.998
it is literally just an expression
of value, an agreed value.

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.118
So what's happening now,
in the digital age,

00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:49.860
is that we can quantify value
in lots of different ways

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:51.477
and do it more easily,

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:54.155
and sometimes the way
that we quantify those values,

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.678
it makes it much easier

00:03:56.702 --> 00:04:00.475
to create new forms and valid
forms of currency.

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.531
In that context, you can see
that networks like Bitcoin

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:07.174
suddenly start to make a bit more sense.

00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:10.218
So if you think we're starting to question

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:12.808
and disrupt and interrogate
what money means,

00:04:12.832 --> 00:04:15.915
what our relationship with it
is, what defines money,

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.993
then the ultimate extension of that is,

00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:21.846
is there a reason
for the government to be in charge

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.302
of money anymore?

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:26.136
So obviously I'm looking at this
through a marketing prism,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.806
so from a brand perspective,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.482
brands literally stand or fall
on their reputations.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.808
And if you think about it, reputation
has now become a currency.

00:04:33.832 --> 00:04:35.919
You know, reputations are built on trust,

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:38.469
consistency, transparency.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.017
So if you've actually decided
that you trust a brand,

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.851
you want a relationship, you
want to engage with the brand,

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.710
you're already kind of participating
in lots of new forms

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:48.249
of currency.

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:50.239
So you think about loyalty.

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:52.302
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.537
You think about rewards
schemes, air miles.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.686
The Economist said a few years ago that

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.876
there are actually more
unredeemed air miles in the world

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.776
than there are dollar
bills in circulation.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.324
You know, when you are standing
in line in Starbucks,

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:10.034
30 percent of transactions
in Starbucks on any one day

00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:13.096
are actually being made
with Starbucks Star points.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.930
So that's a sort of Starbucks currency

00:05:14.954 --> 00:05:16.963
staying within its ecosystem.

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:19.891
And what I find interesting is that Amazon

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:22.971
has recently launched Amazon coins.

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:25.710
So admittedly it's a currency at the moment
that's purely for the Kindle.

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:28.898
So you can buy apps and make
purchases within those apps,

00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:30.295
but you think about Amazon,

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.653
you look at the trust
barometer that I showed you

00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:35.591
where people are starting
to trust businesses,

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.092
especially businesses
that they believe in and trust

00:05:38.116 --> 00:05:39.482
more than governments.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.984
So suddenly, you start thinking,

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.822
well Amazon potentially could push this.

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:44.512
It could become a natural extension,

00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:46.013
that as well as buying stuff --

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:48.704
take it out of the Kindle --
you could buy books, music,

00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:53.277
real-life products, appliances
and goods and so on.

00:05:53.301 --> 00:05:55.705
And suddenly you're getting
Amazon, as a brand,

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.322
is going head to head
with the Federal Reserve

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.489
in terms of how you want
to spend your money,

00:05:59.513 --> 00:06:01.864
what money is, what constitutes money.

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:05.460
And I'll get you back
to Tide, the detergent now,

00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:06.872
as I promised.

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:09.205
This is a fantastic article I came
across in New York Magazine,

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.035
where it was saying that drug
users across America

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.211
are actually purchasing drugs

00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:16.862
with bottles of Tide detergent.

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:18.950
So they're going into convenience stores,

00:06:18.974 --> 00:06:20.060
stealing Tide,

00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:22.254
and a $20 bottle of Tide

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:27.130
is equal to 10 dollars
of crack cocaine or weed.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.393
And what they're saying,
so some criminologists

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:31.798
have looked at this and they're
saying, well, okay,

00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:33.624
Tide as a product sells at a premium.

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.741
It's 50 percent
above the category average.

00:06:35.765 --> 00:06:39.069
It's infused with a very
complex cocktail of chemicals,

00:06:39.093 --> 00:06:41.454
so it smells very luxurious
and very distinctive,

00:06:41.478 --> 00:06:43.402
and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:47.002
it's been supported by a lot
of mass media advertising.

00:06:47.026 --> 00:06:49.871
So what they're saying is that drug
users are consumers too,

00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:51.943
so they have this
in their neural pathways.

00:06:51.967 --> 00:06:53.872
When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:56.629
They say, that is trust. I trust that.
That's quality.

00:06:56.653 --> 00:06:59.248
So it becomes this unit of currency,

00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:01.034
which the New York Magazine described

00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:04.531
as a very oddly loyal crime
wave, brand-loyal crime wave,

00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:07.884
and criminals are actually
calling Tide "liquid gold."

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:10.099
Now, what I thought
was funny was the reaction

00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:11.443
from the P&amp;G spokesperson.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:14.467
They said, obviously tried
to dissociate themselves from drugs,

00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:16.873
but said, "It reminds me of one thing

00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:20.914
and that's the value of the brand
has stayed consistent." (Laughter)

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:22.775
Which backs up my point
and shows he didn't even

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:24.612
break a sweat when he said that.

00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:27.306
So that brings me back
to the connection with sweat.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.645
In Mexico, Nike has run
a campaign recently

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.419
called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.

00:07:31.443 --> 00:07:32.808
So you think about,

00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:34.542
these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:36.043
or you're using a Nike FuelBand

00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:38.724
that basically tracks
your movement, your energy,

00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:40.529
your calorie consumption.

00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:42.364
And what's happening here,
this is where you've actually

00:07:42.388 --> 00:07:45.394
elected to join that Nike community.
You've bought into it.

00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:47.514
They're not advertising
loud messages at you,

00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:49.712
and that's where advertising
has started to shift now

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.366
is into things like services,
tools and applications.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.311
So Nike is literally acting
as a well-being partner,

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:58.196
a health and fitness partner
and service provider.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.354
So what happens with this
is they're saying, "Right,

00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:02.950
you have a data dashboard.
We know how far you've run,

00:08:02.974 --> 00:08:05.719
how far you've moved, what your calorie
intake, all that sort of stuff.

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:08.941
What you can do is, the more you
run, the more points you get,

00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:11.919
and we have an auction where
you can buy Nike stuff

00:08:11.943 --> 00:08:15.442
but only by proving that you've actually
used the product to do stuff."

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:17.562
And you can't come into this.
This is purely

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.285
for the community that are sweating

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:21.920
using Nike products. You
can't buy stuff with pesos.

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:26.918
This is literally a closed
environment, a closed auction space.

00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:30.319
In Africa, you know, airtime has become

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.153
literally a currency in its own right.

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:34.256
People are used to,
because mobile is king,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.101
they're very, very used
to transferring money,

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.079
making payments via mobile.

00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:41.770
And one of my favorite examples
from a brand perspective

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:43.715
going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.424
lots of people make purchases in markets

00:08:46.448 --> 00:08:48.205
and very small independent stores.

00:08:48.229 --> 00:08:50.631
Loose change, small
change is a real problem,

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.179
and what tends to happen
is you buy a bunch of stuff,

00:08:53.203 --> 00:08:54.164
you're due, say,

00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:56.307
10 cents, 20 cents in change.

00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:58.947
The shopkeepers tend to give
you things like an onion

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.447
or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:02.175
because they don't have small change.

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:04.342
So when Vodafone came
in and saw this problem,

00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:05.793
this consumer pain point, they created

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:07.867
some small change which they call Fakka,

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.548
which literally sits and is given

00:09:09.572 --> 00:09:11.743
by the shopkeepers to people,

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.577
and it's credit that goes
straight onto their mobile phone.

00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:16.963
So this currency becomes
credit, which again,

00:09:16.987 --> 00:09:18.431
is really, really interesting.

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:20.741
And we did a survey
that backs up the fact that,

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:22.387
you know, 45 percent of people

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.681
in this very crucial
demographic in the U.S.

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:27.705
were saying that they're comfortable using

00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:30.218
an independent or branded currency.

00:09:30.242 --> 00:09:32.242
So that's getting really interesting here,

00:09:32.266 --> 00:09:34.132
a really interesting dynamic going on.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.657
And you think, corporations

00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:38.391
should start taking their assets
and thinking of them

00:09:38.415 --> 00:09:40.926
in a different way and trading them.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.386
And you think, is it much of a leap?

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.425
It seems farfetched,
but when you think about it,

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:49.143
in America in 1860,

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:53.350
there were 1,600 corporations
issuing banknotes.

00:09:53.374 --> 00:09:56.650
There were 8,000 kinds
of notes in America.

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:57.907
And the only thing that stopped that,

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.515
the government controlled
four percent of the supply,

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:02.159
and the only thing that stopped it

00:10:02.183 --> 00:10:03.852
was the Civil War breaking out,

00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:06.924
and the government suddenly wanted
to take control of the money.

00:10:06.948 --> 00:10:10.566
So government, money, war,
nothing changes there, then.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.421
So what I'm going to ask is, basically,

00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:15.816
is history repeating itself?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.717
Is technology making paper
money feel outmoded?

00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.860
Are we decoupling money
from the government?

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:24.884
You know, you think about, brands
are starting to fill the gaps.

00:10:24.908 --> 00:10:28.115
Corporations are filling gaps
that governments can't afford to fill.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.876
So I think, you know,
will we be standing on stage

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.561
buying a coffee -- organic,
fair trade coffee -- next year

00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:37.342
using TED florins or TED shillings?

00:10:37.366 --> 00:10:39.029
Thank you very much.

00:10:39.053 --> 00:10:41.229
(Applause)

00:10:41.253 --> 00:10:46.300
Thank you. (Applause)
