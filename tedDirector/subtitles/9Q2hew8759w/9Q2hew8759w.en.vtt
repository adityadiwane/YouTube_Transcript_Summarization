00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:17.710
I collaborate with bacteria.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.592
And I'm about to show you

00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:20.772
some stop-motion footage that I made recently

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:23.006
where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.556
from their environment

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:26.490
over the period of an hour.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.855
So what you're seeing here

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.073
is the bacteria metabolizing,

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:31.272
and as they do so

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:32.878
they create an electrical charge.

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:35.211
And this attracts metals

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.378
from their local environment.

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:40.295
And these metals accumulate as minerals

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:42.212
on the surface of the bacteria.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:44.379
One of the most pervasive problems

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.128
in the world today for people

00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:47.545
is inadequate access

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:49.296
to clean drinking water.

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:50.962
And the desalination process

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.746
is one where we take out salts.

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:55.261
We can use it for drinking and agriculture.

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.346
Removing the salts from water --

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:58.607
particularly seawater --

00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:00.211
through reverse osmosis

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.529
is a critical technique

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:04.761
for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:05.880
around the globe.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.344
So seawater reverse osmosis

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.511
is a membrane-filtration technology.

00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.081
We take the water from the sea

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:13.612
and we apply pressure.

00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:16.536
And this pressure forces the seawater

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:17.836
through a membrane.

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:19.271
This takes energy,

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.803
producing clean water.

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:25.504
But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:26.917
But the process is very expensive

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.551
and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.333
And also, the brine that's produced

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.217
is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:36.765
And this is detrimental to the local ecology

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:39.200
of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.216
So I work in Singapore at the moment,

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.983
and this is a place that's really a leading place

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:45.984
for desalination technology.

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:48.534
And Singapore proposes by 2060

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:51.633
to produce [900] million liters per day

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.466
of desalinated water.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.816
But this will produce an equally massive amount

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.569
of desalination brine.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.767
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.716
So what we're doing at the moment

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:06.382
is we're accumulating metals

00:02:06.382 --> 00:02:08.366
like calcium, potassium and magnesium

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.600
from out of desalination brine.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.882
And this, in terms of magnesium

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.432
and the amount of water that I just mentioned,

00:02:15.432 --> 00:02:18.382
equates to a $4.5 billion

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:20.781
mining industry for Singapore --

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:23.331
a place that doesn't have any natural resources.

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.981
So I'd like you to image a mining industry

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.070
in a way that one hasn't existed before;

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.236
imagine a mining industry

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:32.503
that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:34.614
imagine bacteria helping us do this

00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:38.086
by accumulating and precipitating

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.503
and sedimenting minerals

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:42.352
out of desalination brine.

00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:43.770
And what you can see here

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.252
is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:49.602
a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.953
Thank you.

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:54.585
