00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
The career that I started early on in my life

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
and high deserts and low deserts.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
and contain unbelievable biological wonders

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Apart from the intrinsic value

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
we're also using these as templates

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
for figuring out how to go look

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
for life on other planets.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Particularly Mars, but also Europa,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
the small, icy moon around Jupiter.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
I'm very passionately interested in the human future,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
on the Moon and Mars particularly,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
and elsewhere in the solar system.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
I think it's time that we transitioned

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
to a solar system-going civilization and species.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Notably Mars, as a first example.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
is how I actually got to this state

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
and why I do the work that I do.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
Because in the mid-1950s,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
when I was a tiny child,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
they had the audacity to launch

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And a tremendous amount of money

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
went into the funding of science

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
and mathematics skills for kids.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And I'm a product of that generation,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
like so many other of my peers.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Of course, refusing to grow up --

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
-- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
but I do a fairly good job of that --

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
but really retaining that childlike quality

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
of not caring what other people think

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
about what you're interested in, is really critical.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
The next element is the fact that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I have applied a value judgment

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and my value judgment is that the presence of life

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
is better than no life.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And so, life is more valuable than no life.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
And so I think that that holds together

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
a great deal of the work

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
that people in this audience approach.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
I'm very interested in Mars, of course,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
And that took what had been

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
a tiny little astronomical object in the sky,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
that you would see as a dot,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and turned it completely into a landscape,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
as that very first primitive picture

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
came rastering across the screen.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
And when it became a landscape,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
it also became a destination,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
and altered, really, the course of my life.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
In my graduate years I worked with

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
working on global change issues.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
We've written a number of things on

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.330
the role of Gaia hypothesis --

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
in any meaningful scientific sense,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and then, as an outgrowth of that,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.330
I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
So, wonderful things and grim things.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
with external eyes, not just as our home.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
to try to then think about the way

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
our planet behaves, as a planet,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
and with the life that's on it.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
And all of this seems to me to be

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
a salient point in history.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
We're getting ready to begin to go

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
through the process of leaving our planet of origin

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
and out into the wider solar system and beyond.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
So, back to Mars.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
even on this planet.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
So, finding life on another planet

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
is a non-trivial occupation

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
sort of depends on what you think about

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
the chances of life in the universe.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
I think, myself,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
that life is a natural outgrowth

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
of the increasing complexification of matter over time.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
So, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
and you get planets forming --

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
Certainly, in the last 15 years,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
we've seen increasing numbers of planets

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
outside of our solar system being confirmed,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and just last month, a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
a planet in the size-class of Earth

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
has actually been found.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And so this is very exciting news.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
So, my first bold prediction is that,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
It's going to be everywhere we look --

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
So, what about life on Mars?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
I would've probably said, a couple of percent.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
I was once sneeringly introduced

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
by a former NASA official,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
as the only person on the planet

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
who still thought there was life on Mars.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
so there's a certain amount of glory

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
in outliving your adversaries.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
But things have changed greatly

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
over the last dozen years.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
And the reason that they have changed

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
is because we now have new information.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
and the MER Rover missions

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
that are on Mars as we speak now

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
and the European Space Agency's Mars Express,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
has taught us a number of amazing things.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
And so where there is water,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
there is a very high chance of our kind of life.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place –

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
and there are these amazing structures called blueberries,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
which are these little, rocky concretions

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
that we are busy making biologically

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
in my lab right now.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
So, with all of these things put together,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
I think that the chances of life

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
are much greater than I would've ever thought.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
So this is a very bold statement.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
I think it's there, and I think we need

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
to go look for it, and I think it's underground.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.330
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
How do you plan to look for it?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
How do you know it when you find it?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it --

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Very critically, how do we protect it,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
if we find it, and not contaminate it?

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
And also, even perhaps more critically, because

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
this is the only home planet we have,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
how do we protect us from it, while we study it?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
So why might it be hard to find?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
to study microscopic things,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
although the amazing tools that we now have to do that

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
allow us to study things in much greater depth,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
at much smaller scales than ever before.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
And so, there's a game of predator-prey

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.330
that's going to be, essentially, universal, really,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
in any kind of biological system.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties –

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
its chemistry, or its size.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
We say small, but what does that mean?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
And speed of activity, which is something that we face

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
in our work with sub-surface organisms,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
because they grow very, very slowly.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
If I were to take a swab off your teeth

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
and plate it on a Petri plate,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
But the organisms that we work with,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
from the sub-surface of Earth,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
very often it's months -- and in many cases, years --

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
before we see any growth whatsoever.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
But the real issue is that we are guided by

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
our limited experience,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
then we can't recognize what to look for,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
or how to plan for it.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
So, perspective is everything

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
I have learned to think about Earth

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
as an extraterrestrial planet.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
This is my favorite game on airplanes:

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
where you're in an airplane and you look out the window,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.330
you see the horizon.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
I always turn my head on the side,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
and that simple change makes me go from

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
seeing this planet as home,

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
to seeing it as a planet.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
when I'm sitting in a window seat.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Well, this is what we apply to our work.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.330
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
coming into this cave from volcanic sources

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
and from the breakdown of evaporite --

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed --

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
and it is a completely hostile environment for us.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.330
and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
This is regularly several hundred parts per million.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
So, it's a very hazardous environment,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
with CO as well, and many other gases.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
These extreme physical and chemical parameters

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.330
make the biology that grows in these places very special.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
This is one of the richest caves

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
that we have found on the planet, anywhere.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
It's bursting with life.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
but one of the reasons that we're interested in them

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
is because they represent, really,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
So, this is part of the ability that we have,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
to try to stretch our imagination,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
in terms of what we may find in the future.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
There's so much life in this cave,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
and I can't even begin

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
to scratch the surface of it with you.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
But one of the most famous objects out of this

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
making more sulfuric acid,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
and living at pHs right around zero.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
In fact, there's so much energy available

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
for biology in this cave,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
And the local Zoque Indians

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
harvest this twice a year,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
This is very unusual for caves.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in --

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
It's 115 miles of mapped passage,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
it's pristine, it has no natural opening

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
and it's a gigantic biological,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
geo-microbiological laboratory.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
In this cave, great areas are covered by

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
this reddish material that you see here,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
and also these enormous crystals

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
of selenite that you can see dangling down.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
This stuff is produced biologically.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
that organisms are busy munching their way through.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
They take iron and manganese minerals

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
within the bedrock and they oxidize them.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.330
And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
to run their life processes.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
Interestingly enough, they also do this

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
And so, the obvious avenue

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
for bio-remediation

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
comes from organisms like this.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
These organisms we now bring into the lab,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
that we find on the walls of these caves.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
which are a by-product of volcanic activity,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
we find these walls totally covered,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
in many cases,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
by these beautiful, glistening silver walls,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And these are mineral deposits

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
that are also made by bacteria.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
And you can see in these central images here,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys --

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
these are gardens of these bacteria.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
One of the interesting things about these particular guys

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
is that they're in the actinomycete

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
and streptomycete groups of the bacteria,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
which is where we get most of our antibiotics.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
The sub-surface of Earth

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
contains a vast biodiversity.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
And these organisms,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
because they're very separate from the surface,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.330
make a vast array of novel compounds.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And so, the potential for exploiting this

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
is completely untapped,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
but probably exceeds most of the rest

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
of the biodiversity of the planet.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
So, lava-tube caves--

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
We know that on Mars and the Moon

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
there are tons of these structures.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.330
We can see them.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
On the left you can see a lava tube forming

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily --

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
and this is the way these tubes form.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And when they hollow out,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
then they become habitats for organisms.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
These are all over the planet Mars,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and we're busy cataloguing them now.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
on Mars, at least of that type.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
In order to access

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
these sub-surface environments that we're interested in,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
It requires crawling, climbing,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
rope-work, technical rope-work

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.330
and many other complex human motions

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
in order to access these.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.330
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
Why would we want to do it robotically?

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Well, we're going to be sending

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
robotic missions to Mars

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
long in advance of human missions.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.330
about the preciousness of any life that we may find

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
is to have an intermediary.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And in this case, we're imagining

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
intermediary robotic devices

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
that can actually do some of that

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
front-end work for us,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
to protect any potential life that we find.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
I'm not going to go through all of these projects now,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
in collaboration with a number of different groups.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
I want to talk specifically about the

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
array that you see on the top.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
These are hopping microbot swarms.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
and we have come up with the idea

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
of having little, jumping bean-like

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
robots

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.330
that are propelled by artificial muscle,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties --

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And these allow them to hop.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
They behave with

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
a swarm behavior,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
where they relate to each other,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
modeled after insect swarm behavior,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
and they could be made very numerous.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
And so, one can send a thousand of them,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
as you can see in this upper left-hand picture,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
If you send a thousand of them,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
And so, that allows you the flexibility

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
to go into very challenging terrain

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
and actually make your way where you want to go.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.330
about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
It occurred to us a number of years ago

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
that caves have many properties

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
that people have used

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.330
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
looking at the irreducible set of technologies

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
that you would need in order to

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
on the Moon or Mars.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
and we have gone

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
in the relatively primitive technology direction.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
that can conform to the complex topological shape

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
on the inside of a cave,

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.330
foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.330
various ways of getting breathing gases

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.330
made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
And the future is there for us

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.330
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
but I think in the future we'll be using them

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.330
for habitat and science on these other bodies.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.330
Now, my view of what the current status

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.330
of potential life on Mars is

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.330
that it's probably been on the planet,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
maybe one in two chances.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.330
The question as to whether

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.330
there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.330
has now been very muddied,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.330
because we now know,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.330
that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
One of the burning questions, of course, is

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.330
if we go there and find life in the sub-surface,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
as I fully expect that we will,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.330
is that a second genesis of life?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
Did life start here

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.330
and was it transported there?

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.330
Did it start there and get transported here?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.330
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
and where I expect that we will

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.330
have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.330
Thank you.
