00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.478
Thank you. I have to tell you
I'm both challenged and excited.

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:33.414
My excitement is: I get a chance
to give something back.

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:36.976
My challenge is: the shortest seminar
I usually do is 50 hours.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.625
(Laughter)

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.879
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --

00:00:40.903 --> 00:00:43.138
I do more, obviously,
I also coach people --

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.933
but I'm into immersion,
because how did you learn language?

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.562
Not just by learning principles,

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:50.439
you got in it and you did it
so often that it became real.

00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:53.940
The bottom line of why I'm here,
besides being a crazy mofo, is that --

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.703
I'm not here to motivate you,
you don't need that, obviously.

00:00:57.727 --> 00:00:59.750
Often that's what people think I do,

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:01.489
and it's the furthest thing from it.

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:03.558
What happens, though, is people say to me,

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.050
"I don't need any motivation."

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.617
But that's not what I do.

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.508
I'm the "why" guy.

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:10.604
I want to know why you do what you do.

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:12.453
What is your motive for action?

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.313
What is it that drives you
in your life today? Not 10 years ago.

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:18.042
Are you running the same pattern?

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.978
Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive, activated,

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.810
is the most important thing.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.413
I'm here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:29.254
All of us here have great minds.

00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:31.706
Most of us here have great minds, right?

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.090
We all know how to think.

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:36.203
With our minds we can
rationalize anything.

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:37.569
We can make anything happen.

00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:40.371
I agree with what was described
a few days ago,

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:42.722
that people work in their self-interest.

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:45.364
But we know that that's bullshit at times.

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.752
You don't work in your
self-interest all the time,

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:49.643
because when emotion comes into it,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.710
the wiring changes
in the way it functions.

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:55.685
So it's wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is,

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.868
especially those who are very smart
can play this game in our head.

00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:00.994
But I really want to know
what's driving you.

00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:02.876
What I would like to invite you to do

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.406
by the end of this talk is explore
where you are today, for two reasons.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.311
One: so that you can contribute more.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:11.605
And two: that hopefully we can not just
understand other people more,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.519
but appreciate them more,
and create the kinds of connections

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.466
that can stop some of the challenges
that we face today.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.235
They're only going to get magnified
by the very technology that connects us,

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.045
because it's making us intersect.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.295
That intersection
doesn't always create a view

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.505
of "everybody now understands everybody,

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.893
and everybody appreciates everybody."

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:32.508
I've had an obsession
basically for 30 years,

00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:36.847
"What makes the difference
in the quality of people's lives?

00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:38.328
What in their performance?"

00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:40.530
I got hired to produce the result now.

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.050
I've done it for 30 years.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.621
I get the phone call

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:46.387
when the athlete is burning down
on national television,

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.097
and they were ahead by five strokes

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.121
and now they can't get back on the course.

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.831
I've got to do something right now
or nothing matters.

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:55.827
I get the phone call when the child
is going to commit suicide,

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:57.298
I've got to do something.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.976
In 29 years, I'm very grateful
to tell you I've never lost one.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.504
It doesn't mean I won't some day,
but I haven't yet.

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:06.904
The reason is an understanding
of these human needs.

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:10.039
When I get those calls
about performance, that's one thing.

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:11.549
How do you make a change?

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:15.568
I'm also looking to see what is shaping
the person's ability to contribute,

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.102
to do something beyond themselves.

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.234
Maybe the real question is,

00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:23.629
I look at life and say
there's two master lessons.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:25.732
One is: there's the science
of achievement,

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:28.526
which almost everyone here
has mastered amazingly.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.045
"How do you take the invisible
and make it visible,"

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.786
How do you make your dreams happen?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.397
Your business, your contribution
to society, money --

00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.133
whatever, your body, your family.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:40.660
The other lesson that is rarely
mastered is the art of fulfillment.

00:03:41.517 --> 00:03:43.093
Because science is easy, right?

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:46.022
We know the rules, you write the code
and you get the results.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.190
Once you know the game,
you just up the ante, don't you?

00:03:49.214 --> 00:03:51.647
But when it comes
to fulfillment -- that's an art.

00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.867
The reason is, it's about
appreciation and contribution.

00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:56.976
You can only feel so much by yourself.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.936
I've had an interesting laboratory
to try to answer the real question

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.516
how somebody's life changes

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.851
if you look at them like those people
that you've given everything to?

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.999
Like all the resources they say they need.

00:04:08.023 --> 00:04:10.809
You gave not a 100-dollar computer,
but the best computer.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.355
You gave them love, joy,
were there to comfort them.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.975
Those people very often --
you know some of them --

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.440
end up the rest of their life

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.889
with all this love, education,
money and background

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:21.297
going in and out of rehab.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.976
Some people have been
through ultimate pain,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.375
psychologically, sexually,
spiritually, emotionally abused --

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.055
and not always, but often,

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:33.283
they become some of the people
that contribute the most to society.

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:37.239
The question we've got to ask
ourselves really is, what is it?

00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:38.606
What is it that shapes us?

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.241
We live in a therapy culture.

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:43.307
Most of us don't do that,
but the culture's a therapy culture,

00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.320
the mindset that we are our past.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:47.976
And you wouldn't be in this room
if you bought that,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.178
but most of society
thinks biography is destiny.

00:04:51.202 --> 00:04:52.845
The past equals the future.

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.584
Of course it does if you live there.

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:57.276
But what we know and what
we have to remind ourselves --

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.494
because you can know
something intellectually

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:01.366
and then not use it, not apply it.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.628
We've got to remind ourselves
that decision is the ultimate power.

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:08.356
When you ask people,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.253
have you failed to achieve
something significant in your life?

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:13.976
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.976
TR: Thanks for the interaction
on a high level there.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.976
But if you ask people,
why didn't you achieve something?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.255
Somebody who's working for you,
or a partner, or even yourself.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.375
When you fail to achieve,
what's the reason people say?

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.542
What do they tell you?

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:31.875
Didn't have the knowledge,
didn't have the money,

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:36.136
didn't have the time,
didn't have the technology.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.994
I didn't have the right manager.

00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:40.707
Al Gore: Supreme Court.
TR: The Supreme Court.

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:42.961
(Laughter)

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:45.533
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.976
(Applause continues)

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.055
TR: And --

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.977
(Applause)

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:04.097
What do all those, including
the Supreme Court, have in common?

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:05.495
(Laughter)

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:10.319
They are a claim to you missing
resources, and they may be accurate.

00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:12.976
You may not have the money,
or the Supreme Court,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.976
but that is not the defining factor.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.957
(Applause) (Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.524
And you correct me if I'm wrong.

00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:26.976
The defining factor is never resources;
it's resourcefulness.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.804
And what I mean specifically,
rather than just some phrase,

00:06:29.828 --> 00:06:33.040
is if you have emotion, human emotion,

00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:37.093
something that I experienced from you
the day before yesterday

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:39.708
at a level that is as profound
as I've ever experienced

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.970
and I believe with that emotion
you would have beat his ass and won.

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:44.051
Audience: Yeah!

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:48.742
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.976
How easy for me to tell him
what he should do.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.976
(Laughter)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.887
Idiot, Robbins.

00:06:55.911 --> 00:07:01.167
But I know when we watched
the debate at that time,

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.478
there were emotions
that blocked people's ability

00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:05.479
to get this man's intellect and capacity.

00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:08.399
And the way that it came across
to some people on that day --

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:11.798
because I know people that wanted
to vote in your direction and didn't,

00:07:11.822 --> 00:07:13.165
and I was upset.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.628
But there was emotion there.

00:07:14.652 --> 00:07:16.357
Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:17.715
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:18.879
TR: So, emotion is it.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:22.653
And if we get the right emotion,
we can get ourselves to do anything.

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:24.597
If you're creative, playful, fun enough,

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:26.691
can you get through to anybody, yes or no?

00:07:26.715 --> 00:07:28.159
If you don't have the money,

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:30.712
but you're creative and determined,
you find the way.

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:32.219
This is the ultimate resource.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.476
But this is not the story
that people tell us.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.576
They tell us a bunch of different stories.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.309
They tell us we don't have
the resources, but ultimately,

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.897
if you take a look here,

00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:44.263
they say, what are all the reasons
they haven't accomplished that?

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:46.548
He's broken my pattern,
that son-of-a-bitch.

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:49.899
(Laughter)

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:52.277
But I appreciated the energy,
I'll tell you that.

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:53.378
(Laughter)

00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:54.919
What determines your resources?

00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:58.080
We've said decisions shape destiny,
which is my focus here.

00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:01.200
If decisions shape destiny,
what determines it is three decisions.

00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:02.377
What will you focus on?

00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:04.852
You have to decide
what you're going to focus on.

00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:06.337
Consciously or unconsciously.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.272
the minute you decide to focus,
you must give it a meaning,

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:11.185
and that meaning produces emotion.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:13.035
Is this the end or the beginning?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:16.958
Is God punishing me or rewarding me,
or is this the roll of the dice?

00:08:16.982 --> 00:08:19.976
An emotion creates
what we're going to do, or the action.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.976
So, think about your own life,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.048
the decisions that
have shaped your destiny.

00:08:24.072 --> 00:08:27.058
And that sounds really heavy,
but in the last five or 10 years,

00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:28.629
have there been some decisions

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:32.490
that if you'd made a different decision,
your life would be completely different?

00:08:32.514 --> 00:08:35.208
How many can think about it?
Better or worse. Say, "Aye."

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:36.264
Audience: Aye.

00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:38.952
So the bottom line is,
maybe it was where to go to work,

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:41.829
and you met the love of your life there,
a career decision.

00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:43.819
I know the Google geniuses I saw here --

00:08:43.843 --> 00:08:47.231
I mean, I understand that their decision
was to sell their technology.

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.396
What if they made that decision
versus to build their own culture?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.349
How would the world or their lives
be different, their impact?

00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:55.490
The history of our world
is these decisions.

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:59.076
When a woman stands up and says,
"No, I won't go to the back of the bus."

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.619
She didn't just affect her life.
That decision shaped our culture.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.162
Or someone standing in front of a tank.

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:07.976
Or being in a position
like Lance Armstrong,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.544
"You've got testicular cancer."

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:12.607
That's pretty tough for any male,
especially if you ride a bike.

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:13.976
(Laughter)

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.709
You've got it in your brain;
you've got it in your lungs.

00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:18.925
But what was his decision
of what to focus on?

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:21.088
Different than most people.
What did it mean?

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:23.063
It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.

00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:25.878
He goes off and wins
seven championships he never once won

00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:29.784
before the cancer, because he got
emotional fitness, psychological strength.

00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:32.299
That's the difference
in human beings that I've seen

00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:34.182
of the three million I've been around.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:39.991
In my lab, I've had three million people
from 80 countries over the last 29 years.

00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:42.479
And after a while,
patterns become obvious.

00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:46.502
You see that South America and Africa
may be connected in a certain way, right?

00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:49.144
Others say, "Oh, that sounds
ridiculous." It's simple.

00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:51.452
So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:55.798
Two invisible forces.
Very quickly. One: state.

00:09:55.822 --> 00:09:56.976
We all have had times,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.793
you did something, and after,
you thought to yourself,

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:02.976
"I can't believe I said or did that,
that was so stupid."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.095
Who's been there? Say, "Aye."
Audience: Aye.

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:07.515
Or after you did something,
you go, "That was me!"

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:08.976
(Laughter)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.834
It wasn't your ability; it was your state.

00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:14.778
Your model of the world
is what shapes you long term.

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:18.334
Your model of the world is the filter.
That's what's shaping us.

00:10:18.358 --> 00:10:19.958
It makes people make decisions.

00:10:19.982 --> 00:10:23.238
To influence somebody, we need to know
what already influences them.

00:10:23.262 --> 00:10:25.071
It's made up of three parts.

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:27.434
First, what's your target?
What are you after?

00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:28.976
It's not your desires.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.635
You can get your desires or goals.

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:33.873
Who has ever got a goal or desire
and thought, is this all there is?

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:35.150
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:38.042
It's needs we have. I believe
there are six human needs.

00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:40.976
Second, once you know what the target
that's driving you is

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.976
and you uncover it for the truth --
you don't form it --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.735
then you find out what's your map,

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.820
what's the belief systems
that tell you how to get those needs.

00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:51.795
Some people think the way
to get them is to destroy the world,

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:54.369
some people, to build,
create something, love someone.

00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:56.976
There's the fuel you pick.
So very quickly, six needs.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.471
Let me tell you what they are.
First one: certainty.

00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:01.958
These are not goals or desires,
these are universal.

00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:04.082
Everyone needs certainty
they can avoid pain

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:05.523
and at least be comfortable.

00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:06.801
Now, how do you get it?

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:09.910
Control everybody? Develop a skill?
Give up? Smoke a cigarette?

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:11.976
And if you got totally
certain, ironically,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.286
even though we need that --

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.503
you're not certain about your health,
or your children, or money.

00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:18.742
If you're not sure
the ceiling will hold up,

00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:20.385
you won't listen to any speaker.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:24.158
While we go for certainty differently,
if we get total certainty, we get what?

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.876
What do you feel if you're certain?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.553
You know what will happen,
when and how it will happen,

00:11:28.577 --> 00:11:29.676
what would you feel?

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.376
Bored out of your minds.
So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.976
gave us a second human need,
which is uncertainty.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.976
We need variety. We need surprise.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.296
How many of you here
love surprises? Say, "Aye."

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.401
Audience: Aye.

00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:44.036
TR: Bullshit. You like
the surprises you want.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.404
The ones you don't want,
you call problems, but you need them.

00:11:47.428 --> 00:11:49.207
So, variety is important.

00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:52.343
Have you ever rented a video
or a film that you've already seen?

00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:54.176
Who's done this? Get a fucking life.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.976
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.610
Why are you doing it?

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.417
You're certain it's good
because you read or saw it before,

00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:03.135
but you're hoping it's been
long enough you've forgotten,

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.176
and there's variety.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.236
Third human need, critical: significance.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.535
We all need to feel important,
special, unique.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:11.426
You can get it by making more money
or being more spiritual.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.366
You can do it by getting yourself
in a situation where you put

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.376
more tattoos and earrings in places
humans don't want to know.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.465
Whatever it takes.

00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:19.776
The fastest way to do this,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.776
if you have no background,
no culture, no belief and resources

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.439
or resourcefulness, is violence.

00:12:24.463 --> 00:12:28.223
If I put a gun to your head and I live
in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.708
Zero to 10. How high? 10.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:32.818
How certain am I that
you're going to respond to me? 10.

00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:33.958
How much uncertainty?

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:36.676
Who knows what's going to happen next?
Kind of exciting.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.076
Like climbing up into a cave
and doing that stuff

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.380
all the way down there.

00:12:40.404 --> 00:12:41.866
Total variety and uncertainty.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.276
And it's significant, isn't it?
So you want to risk your life for it.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.376
So that's why violence has always
been around and will be around

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.857
unless we have a consciousness
change as a species.

00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:52.876
You can get significance a million ways,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.799
but to be significant, you've got
to be unique and different.

00:12:55.823 --> 00:12:58.805
Here's what we really need:
connection and love, fourth need.

00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:59.876
We all want it;

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.079
most settle for connection,
love's too scary.

00:13:02.103 --> 00:13:04.580
Who here has been hurt
in an intimate relationship?

00:13:04.604 --> 00:13:07.436
If you don't raise your hand,
you've had other shit, too.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.183
And you're going to get hurt again.

00:13:09.207 --> 00:13:11.467
Aren't you glad you came
to this positive visit?

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.011
Here's what's true: we need it.

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:16.411
We can do it through
intimacy, friendship, prayer,

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:17.782
through walking in nature.

00:13:17.806 --> 00:13:20.638
If nothing else works for you,
don't get a cat, get a dog,

00:13:20.662 --> 00:13:24.257
because if you leave for two minutes,
it's like you've been gone six months,

00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.967
when you come back 5 minutes later.

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:28.666
These first four needs,
every human finds a way to meet.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.900
Even if you lie to yourself,
you need to have split personalities.

00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:36.463
I call the first four needs
the needs of the personality.

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:39.221
The last two are the needs of the spirit.

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:41.012
And this is where fulfillment comes.

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:42.831
You won't get it from the first four.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:46.141
You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,
do whatever, meet the first four.

00:13:46.165 --> 00:13:47.741
But number five, you must grow.

00:13:47.765 --> 00:13:48.894
We all know the answer.

00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:50.441
If you don't grow, you're what?

00:13:50.465 --> 00:13:52.574
If a relationship or business
is not growing,

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.735
if you're not growing,

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:56.162
doesn't matter how much
money or friends you have,

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:57.362
how many love you,

00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:58.629
you feel like hell.

00:13:58.653 --> 00:14:00.244
And I believe the reason we grow

00:14:00.268 --> 00:14:02.228
is so we have something to give of value.

00:14:02.252 --> 00:14:04.963
Because the sixth need
is to contribute beyond ourselves.

00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:07.064
Because we all know, corny as that sounds,

00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:08.674
the secret to living is giving.

00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:10.982
We all know life is not about me,
it's about we.

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:13.245
This culture knows that,
this room knows that.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.346
It's exciting.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.964
When you see Nicholas
talking about his $100 computer,

00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:18.327
the most exciting thing is:

00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:20.766
here's a genius,
but he's got a calling now.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.662
You can feel the difference in him,
and it's beautiful.

00:14:23.686 --> 00:14:25.629
And that calling can touch other people.

00:14:25.653 --> 00:14:28.530
My life was touched
because when I was 11 years old,

00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:30.541
Thanksgiving, no money, no food,

00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:31.976
we were not going to starve,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.715
but my father was totally messed up,

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:36.070
my mom was letting him know
how bad he messed up,

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:38.449
and somebody came to the door
and delivered food.

00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:41.533
My father made three decisions,
I know what they were, briefly.

00:14:41.557 --> 00:14:43.382
His focus was "This is charity.

00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:45.072
What does it mean? I'm worthless.

00:14:45.096 --> 00:14:47.721
What do I have to do?
Leave my family," which he did.

00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.227
It was one of the most painful
experiences of life.

00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:52.420
My three decisions
gave me a different path.

00:14:52.796 --> 00:14:56.118
I set focus on "There's food."
What a concept!

00:14:56.142 --> 00:14:57.219
(Laughter)

00:14:57.243 --> 00:15:00.438
But this is what changed my life,
shaped me as a human being.

00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:02.655
Somebody's gift,
I don't even know who it is.

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:04.939
My father always said,
"No one gives a shit."

00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:07.299
And now somebody I don't know,

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.857
they're not asking for anything,
just giving us food,

00:15:09.881 --> 00:15:11.058
looking out for us.

00:15:11.082 --> 00:15:13.721
It made me believe this:
that strangers care.

00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:15.859
And that made me decide,

00:15:15.883 --> 00:15:18.950
if strangers care about me and my family,
I care about them.

00:15:18.974 --> 00:15:21.190
I'm going to do something
to make a difference.

00:15:21.214 --> 00:15:23.311
So when I was 17,
I went out on Thanksgiving,

00:15:23.335 --> 00:15:26.588
it was my target for years to have
enough money to feed two families.

00:15:26.612 --> 00:15:29.077
The most fun and moving thing
I ever did in my life.

00:15:29.101 --> 00:15:30.784
Next year, I did four, then eight.

00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:34.543
I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,
I wasn't doing it for brownie points.

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.953
But after eight,
I thought I could use some help.

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:39.405
So I went out, got my friends involved,

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:42.606
then I grew companies, got 11,
and I built the foundation.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.824
18 years later,

00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:47.294
I'm proud to tell you last year we fed
2 million people in 35 countries

00:15:47.318 --> 00:15:48.502
through our foundation.

00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:50.859
All during the holidays,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.886
in different countries around the world.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.011
(Applause)

00:15:54.035 --> 00:15:55.181
Thank you.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:58.777
I don't tell you that to brag,
but because I'm proud of human beings

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:00.708
because they get excited to contribute

00:16:00.732 --> 00:16:03.841
once they've had the chance
to experience it, not talk about it.

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:05.656
So, finally -- I'm about out of time.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.539
The target that shapes you --

00:16:08.563 --> 00:16:10.422
Here's what's different about people.

00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:11.631
We have the same needs.

00:16:11.655 --> 00:16:14.522
But are you a certainty freak,
is that what you value most,

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:15.723
or uncertainty?

00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:19.288
This man couldn't be a certainty freak
if he climbed through those caves.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.193
Are you driven by significance or love?

00:16:21.217 --> 00:16:22.493
We all need all six,

00:16:22.517 --> 00:16:25.601
but what your lead system is
tilts you in a different direction.

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:28.761
And as you move in a direction,
you have a destination or destiny.

00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:30.210
The second piece is the map.

00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:32.510
The operating system
tells you how to get there,

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:33.815
and some people's map is,

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:36.610
"I'm going to save lives
even if I die for other people,"

00:16:36.634 --> 00:16:37.810
and they're a fireman,

00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:40.750
and somebody else says,
"I'm going to kill people to do it."

00:16:40.774 --> 00:16:43.352
They're trying to meet
the same needs of significance.

00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:45.569
They want to honor God
or honor their family.

00:16:45.593 --> 00:16:47.115
But they have a different map.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:51.018
And there are seven different beliefs;
I can't go through them, because I'm done.

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.371
The last piece is emotion.

00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:54.396
One of the parts of the map is like time.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.709
Some people's idea
of a long time is 100 years.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:59.408
Somebody else's is three seconds,
which is what I have.

00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:02.203
And the last one I've already mentioned
that fell to you.

00:17:02.227 --> 00:17:03.950
If you've got a target and a map --

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:05.907
I can't use Google because I love Macs,

00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:08.027
and they haven't made it
good for Macs yet.

00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:09.332
So if you use MapQuest --

00:17:09.356 --> 00:17:11.771
how many have made
this fatal mistake of using it?

00:17:11.795 --> 00:17:13.891
You use this thing
and you don't get there.

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:17.551
Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
you can never get to where you want to go.

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:18.652
(Laughter)

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:20.010
The last thing is emotion.

00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:22.038
Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:23.537
There are 6,000 emotions

00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:25.850
that we have words for
in the English language,

00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:29.030
which is just a linguistic representation
that changes by language.

00:17:29.054 --> 00:17:31.354
But if your dominant emotions --

00:17:31.378 --> 00:17:34.105
If I have 20,000 people or 1,000

00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:37.181
and I have them write down
all the emotions that they experience

00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:38.206
in an average week,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.160
and I give them as long as they need,

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.473
and on one side
they write empowering emotions,

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:43.812
the other's disempowering,

00:17:43.836 --> 00:17:46.363
guess how many emotions
they experience? Less than 12.

00:17:46.387 --> 00:17:48.483
And half of those
make them feel like shit.

00:17:48.507 --> 00:17:49.932
They have six good feelings.

00:17:49.956 --> 00:17:51.596
Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.863
frustrated, frustrated,
overwhelmed, depressed.

00:17:53.887 --> 00:17:55.360
How many of you know somebody

00:17:55.384 --> 00:17:58.155
who, no matter what happens,
finds a way to get pissed off?

00:17:58.179 --> 00:17:59.359
(Laughter)

00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:03.724
Or no matter what happens,
they find a way to be happy or excited.

00:18:03.748 --> 00:18:05.752
How many of you know somebody like this?

00:18:05.776 --> 00:18:08.722
When 9/11 happened, I'll finish
with this, I was in Hawaii.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.409
I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,

00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:13.819
we were translating
four languages simultaneously

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.963
for a program I was conducting,
for a week.

00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:18.516
The night before was called
Emotional Mastery.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.925
I got up, had no plan
for this, and I said --

00:18:20.949 --> 00:18:24.047
we had fireworks,
I do crazy shit, fun stuff,

00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:25.352
and at the end, I stopped.

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:28.099
I had this plan, but I never know
what I'm going to say.

00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:29.548
And all of a sudden, I said,

00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:32.620
"When do people really start to live?
When they face death."

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.352
And I went through this whole thing

00:18:34.376 --> 00:18:36.858
about, if you weren't going
to get off this island,

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:39.075
if nine days from now,
you were going to die,

00:18:39.099 --> 00:18:41.918
who would you call,
what would you say, what would you do?

00:18:41.942 --> 00:18:43.610
That night is when 9/11 happened.

00:18:43.634 --> 00:18:46.500
One woman had come to the seminar,
and when she came there,

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:49.199
her previous boyfriend had been
kidnapped and murdered.

00:18:49.223 --> 00:18:51.898
Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,
and she said no.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:55.279
He said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing,
it's over with us."

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:56.539
She said, "It's over."

00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:59.528
When I finished that night,
she called him and left a message

00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:02.516
at the top of the World Trade Center
where he worked, saying,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.069
"I love you, I want you to know
I want to marry you.

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:06.497
It was stupid of me."

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.919
She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.
for us, when he called her back,

00:19:09.943 --> 00:19:12.823
and said, "Honey, I can't tell you
what this means.

00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:16.196
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you gave me the greatest gift,

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.577
because I'm going to die."

00:19:18.164 --> 00:19:20.502
And she played the recording
for us in the room.

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:21.951
She was on Larry King later.

00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:23.931
And he said, "You're probably wondering

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.047
how on Earth this could
happen to you twice.

00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:28.553
All I can say is this must be
God's message to you.

00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:31.108
From now on, every day,
give your all, love your all.

00:19:31.132 --> 00:19:33.111
Don't let anything ever stop you."

00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:35.950
She finishes, and a man
stands up, and he says,

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:37.550
"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.

00:19:37.574 --> 00:19:39.767
I'd love to hold your hand
and say I'm sorry,

00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:42.005
but frankly, this is retribution."

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.613
I can't tell you the rest,
because I'm out of time.

00:19:45.637 --> 00:19:52.295
(Laughter)

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:53.495
Are you sure?

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:57.815
(Laughter)

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:59.015
10 seconds!

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.347
(Laughter and applause)

00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:04.318
10 seconds, I want to be respectful.

00:20:04.342 --> 00:20:05.478
All I can tell you is,

00:20:05.502 --> 00:20:07.109
I brought this man on stage

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:10.074
with a man from New York who worked
in the World Trade Center,

00:20:10.098 --> 00:20:12.098
because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.

00:20:12.122 --> 00:20:14.557
More than 50 lost
their entire companies, friends,

00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:16.103
marking off their Palm Pilots.

00:20:16.127 --> 00:20:18.705
One financial trader,
woman made of steel, bawling --

00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:20.554
30 friends crossing off that all died.

00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:23.884
And I said, "What are we
going to focus on?

00:20:24.572 --> 00:20:26.910
What does this mean
and what are we going to do?"

00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:29.006
And I got the group to focus on:

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.746
if you didn't lose somebody today,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.348
your focus is going to be
how to serve somebody else.

00:20:33.372 --> 00:20:36.480
Then one woman stood up
and was so angry, screaming and yelling.

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:39.420
I found out she wasn't from New York,
she's not an American,

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:40.773
doesn't know anybody here.

00:20:40.797 --> 00:20:42.559
I asked, "Do you always get angry?"

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:43.760
She said, "Yes."

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.976
Guilty people got guilty,
sad people got sad.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.675
I took these two men
and I did an indirect negotiation.

00:20:48.699 --> 00:20:51.084
Jewish man with family
in the occupied territory,

00:20:51.108 --> 00:20:54.362
someone in New York who would have died
if he was at work that day,

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.486
and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.790
and I made it very clear.

00:20:57.814 --> 00:21:00.731
This integration is on a film,
which I'd be happy to send you,

00:21:00.755 --> 00:21:02.181
instead of my verbalization,

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:04.305
but the two of them not only came together

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:06.763
and changed their beliefs
and models of the world,

00:21:06.787 --> 00:21:09.509
but worked together to bring,
for almost four years now,

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:11.412
through various mosques and synagogues,

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.054
the idea of how to create peace.

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:15.741
And he wrote a book, called
"My Jihad, My Way of Peace."

00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:17.288
So, transformation can happen.

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:18.536
My invitation to you is:

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.091
explore your web,

00:21:20.115 --> 00:21:21.665
the web in here --

00:21:21.689 --> 00:21:25.277
the needs, the beliefs, the emotions
that are controlling you,

00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:26.478
for two reasons:

00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:28.799
so there's more of you to give,
and achieve, too,

00:21:28.823 --> 00:21:30.111
but I mean give,

00:21:30.135 --> 00:21:32.188
because that's what's
going to fill you up.

00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:34.040
And secondly, so you can appreciate --

00:21:34.064 --> 00:21:36.883
not just understand,
that's intellectual, that's the mind,

00:21:36.907 --> 00:21:39.005
but appreciate
what's driving other people.

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:41.270
It's the only way
our world's going to change.

00:21:41.294 --> 00:21:43.872
God bless you, thank you.
I hope this was of service.

00:21:43.896 --> 00:21:45.505
(Applause)
