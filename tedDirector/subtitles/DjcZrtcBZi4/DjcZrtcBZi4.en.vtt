00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.519
I have a confession to make.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.309
I'm a business professor

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.839
whose ambition has been
to help people learn to lead.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.280
But recently, I've discovered

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.239
that what many of us
think of as great leadership

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.519
does not work when it comes
to leading innovation.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.920
I'm an ethnographer.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.640
I use the methods of anthropology

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.220
to understand the questions
in which I'm interested.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.380
So along with three co-conspirators,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.200
I spent nearly a decade observing
up close and personal

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.679
exceptional leaders of innovation.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.880
We studied 16 men and women,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.439
located in seven countries
across the globe,

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:46.920
working in 12 different industries.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
In total, we spent hundreds
of hours on the ground,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.200
on-site, watching these leaders in action.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.559
We ended up with pages and pages
and pages of field notes

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.920
that we analyzed and looked
for patterns in what our leaders did.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.979
The bottom line?

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.140
If we want to build organizations
that can innovate time and again,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.959
we must unlearn our conventional
notions of leadership.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.560
Leading innovation is not
about creating a vision,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.760
and inspiring others to execute it.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.718
But what do we mean by innovation?

00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:20.079
An innovation is anything
that is both new and useful.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.840
It can be a product or service.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.519
It can be a process
or a way of organizing.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:27.359
It can be incremental,
or it can be breakthrough.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.280
We have a pretty inclusive definition.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.879
How many of you recognize this man?

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.560
Put your hands up.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.840
Keep your hands up,
if you know who this is.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.599
How about these familiar faces?

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.680
(Laughter)

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.840
From your show of hands,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.280
it looks like many of you
have seen a Pixar movie,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.239
but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.879
the founder and CEO of Pixar --

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.799
one of the companies
I had the privilege of studying.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.479
My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.400
when they were working on "Ratatouille,"

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.520
that provocative movie about
a rat becoming a master chef.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.439
Computer-generated movies
are really mainstream today,

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.120
but it took Ed and his
colleagues nearly 20 years

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960
to create the first
full-length C.G. movie.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.240
In the 20 years hence,
they've produced 14 movies.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.000
I was recently at Pixar,
and I'm here to tell you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.069
that number 15 is sure to be a winner.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.280
When many of us think
about innovation, though,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.919
we think about an Einstein
having an 'Aha!' moment.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.280
But we all know that's a myth.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240
Innovation is not about solo genius,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.479
it's about collective genius.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.159
Let's think for a minute about
what it takes to make a Pixar movie:

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.680
No solo genius, no flash of inspiration
produces one of those movies.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.080
On the contrary, it takes about
250 people four to five years,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.639
to make one of those movies.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.319
To help us understand the process,

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.960
an individual in the studio
drew a version of this picture.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.469
He did so reluctantly,

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.840
because it suggested that the process 
was a neat series of steps

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.130
done by discrete groups.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.990
Even with all those arrows,
he thought it failed to really tell you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.840
just how iterative, interrelated
and, frankly, messy their process was.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.730
Throughout the making of a movie
at Pixar, the story evolves.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.520
So think about it.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.280
Some shots go through quickly.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.560
They don't all go through in order.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.199
It depends on how vexing
the challenges are

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.520
that they come up with when they
are working on a particular scene.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.919
So if you think about that scene in "Up"

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.120
where the boy hands the piece
of chocolate to the bird,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.259
that 10 seconds took one animator
almost six months to perfect.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.000
The other thing about a Pixar movie

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.400
is that no part of the movie
is considered finished

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.319
until the entire movie wraps.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.759
Partway through one production,
an animator drew a character

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.760
with an arched eyebrow that
suggested a mischievous side.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.770
When the director saw that
drawing, he thought it was great.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.199
It was beautiful, but he said,

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.020
"You've got to lose it;
it doesn't fit the character."

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.480
Two weeks later, the director
came back and said,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.560
"Let's put in those few seconds of film."

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.600
Because that animator
was allowed to share

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.800
what we referred to
as his slice of genius,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.120
he was able to help that director
reconceive the character

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.759
in a subtle but important way
that really improved the story.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.399
What we know is, at the heart
of innovation is a paradox.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:39.079
You have to unleash the talents
and passions of many people

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:43.809
and you have to harness them
into a work that is actually useful.

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.049
Innovation is a journey.

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.879
It's a type of collaborative
problem solving,

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.639
usually among people
who have different expertise

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.759
and different points of view.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.319
Innovations rarely get created full-blown.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.449
As many of you know,

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.199
they're the result,
usually, of trial and error.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.399
Lots of false starts,
missteps and mistakes.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.199
Innovative work can be
very exhilarating,

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.730
but it also can be
really downright scary.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.079
So when we look at why it is
that Pixar is able to do what it does,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.839
we have to ask ourselves,
what's going on here?

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.800
For sure, history
and certainly Hollywood,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.930
is full of star-studded teams
that have failed.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.790
Most of those failures are attributed

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.879
to too many stars or too many
cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.519
So why is it that Pixar,
with all of its cooks,

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.360
is able to be so successful
time and time again?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.439
When we studied
an Islamic Bank in Dubai,

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.000
or a luxury brand in Korea,
or a social enterprise in Africa,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.079
we found that innovative organizations

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.879
are communities that
have three capabilities:

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.959
creative abrasion, creative
agility and creative resolution.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:07.960
Creative abrasion is about being able
to create a marketplace of ideas

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.160
through debate and discourse.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.079
In innovative organizations,
they amplify differences,

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.319
they don't minimize them.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.360
Creative abrasion is not
about brainstorming,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.480
where people suspend their judgment.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.439
No, they know how to have very
heated but constructive arguments

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.600
to create a portfolio of alternatives.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.879
Individuals in innovative organizations

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.169
learn how to inquire, they learn how
to actively listen, but guess what?

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.959
They also learn how to
advocate for their point of view.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:39.879
They understand that
innovation rarely happens

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.680
unless you have both
diversity and conflict.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.760
Creative agility is about being able
to test and refine that portfolio of ideas

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.120
through quick pursuit,
reflection and adjustment.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.959
It's about discovery-driven learning

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:57.199
where you act, as opposed to plan,
your way to the future.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.680
It's about design thinking where
you have that interesting combination

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.399
of the scientific method
and the artistic process.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.879
It's about running a series of
experiments, and not a series of pilots.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.760
Experiments are usually about learning.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.310
When you get a negative outcome,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.472
you're still really learning something
that you need to know.

00:07:15.472 --> 00:07:17.959
Pilots are often about being right.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:22.319
When they don't work,
someone or something is to blame.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.279
The final capability
is creative resolution.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.990
This is about doing decision making

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.519
in a way that you can actually combine
even opposing ideas

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.040
to reconfigure them in new combinations

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.319
to produce a solution
that is new and useful.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.120
When you look at innovative organizations,
they never go along to get along.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.199
They don't compromise.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.639
They don't let one group
or one individual dominate,

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:50.000
even if it's the boss,
even if it's the expert.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.839
Instead, they have developed

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.399
a rather patient and more inclusive
decision making process

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:59.079
that allows for both/and
solutions to arise

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.879
and not simply either/or solutions.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.879
These three capabilities are why we see

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:10.240
that Pixar is able to do what it does.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.209
Let me give you another example,

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:14.839
and that example is the
infrastructure group of Google.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.519
The infrastructure group
of Google is the group

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:21.569
that has to keep the website
up and running 24/7.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:25.439
So when Google was about
to introduce Gmail and YouTube,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:28.759
they knew that their data storage
system wasn't adequate.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:32.919
The head of the engineering group
and the infrastructure group at that time

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.480
was a man named Bill Coughran.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.240
Bill and his leadership team,
who he referred to as his brain trust,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.120
had to figure out what to do
about this situation.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.960
They thought about it for a while.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.440
Instead of creating a group
to tackle this task,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.720
they decided to allow groups
to emerge spontaneously

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.159
around different alternatives.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.000
Two groups coalesced.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.159
One became known as Big Table,

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:03.679
the other became known
as Build It From Scratch.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.600
Big Table proposed that they
build on the current system.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.960
Build It From Scratch proposed
that it was time for a whole new system.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.759
Separately, these two teams
were allowed to work full-time

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.799
on their particular approach.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:19.919
In engineering reviews,
Bill described his role as,

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:24.879
"Injecting honesty into
the process by driving debate."

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.879
Early on, the teams were encouraged
to build prototypes so that they could

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.320
"bump them up against reality
and discover for themselves

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.120
the strengths and weaknesses
of their particular approach."

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.140
When Build It From Scratch shared
their prototype with the group

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.060
whose beepers would have
to go off in the middle of the night

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.270
if something went wrong
with the website,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:48.120
they heard loud and clear about the
limitations of their particular design.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.039
As the need for a solution
became more urgent

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:54.320
and as the data, or the
evidence, began to come in,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.600
it became pretty clear
that the Big Table solution

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.110
was the right one for the moment.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.200
So they selected that one.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.960
But to make sure that
they did not lose the learning

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.840
of the Build it From Scratch team,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.250
Bill asked two members of that team
to join a new team that was emerging

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.240
to work on the next-generation system.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.000
This whole process took nearly two years,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.399
but I was told that they were
all working at breakneck speed.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:24.720
Early in that process, one of the
engineers had gone to Bill and said,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.759
"We're all too busy
for this inefficient system

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:30.240
of running parallel experiments."

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.320
But as the process unfolded,
he began to understand

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.240
the wisdom of allowing talented
people to play out their passions.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.039
He admitted, "If you had forced us
to all be on one team,

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:44.480
we might have focused on proving
who was right, and winning,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.000
and not on learning and discovering
what was the best answer for Google."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.559
Why is it that Pixar and Google
are able to innovate time and again?

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:57.229
It's because they've mastered
the capabilities required for that.

00:10:57.229 --> 00:10:59.619
They know how to do
collaborative problem solving,

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.759
they know how to do
discovery-driven learning

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:04.460
and they know how to do
integrated decision making.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.679
Some of you may be sitting there
and saying to yourselves right now,

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:10.519
"We don't know how to do
those things in my organization.

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:13.120
So why do they know how to
do those things at Pixar,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.559
and why do they know how to
do those things at Google?"

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.080
When many of the people
that worked for Bill told us,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.480
in their opinion, that Bill was one
of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.649
we completely agreed;
the man is a genius.

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:32.559
Leadership is the secret sauce.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.960
But it's a different kind of leadership,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.290
not the kind many of us think about
when we think about great leadership.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.960
One of the leaders I met with
early on said to me,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.120
"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.039
All they do is make me feel bad."
(Laughter)

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:52.000
"In the first chapter they say
I'm supposed to create a vision.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.240
But if I'm trying to do something
that's truly new, I have no answers.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.240
I don't know what
direction we're going in

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.899
and I'm not even sure I know
how to figure out how to get there."

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:04.440
For sure, there are times
when visionary leadership

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.480
is exactly what is needed.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.879
But if we want to build organizations
that can innovate time and again,

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:14.000
we must recast our understanding
of what leadership is about.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.720
Leading innovation is about
creating the space

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.919
where people are willing
and able to do the hard work

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:23.399
of innovative problem solving.

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:27.240
At this point, some of you
may be wondering,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.559
"What does that leadership
really look like?"

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:34.480
At Pixar, they understand
that innovation takes a village.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.919
The leaders focus on building
a sense of community

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:40.200
and building those three capabilities.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.480
How do they define leadership?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.759
They say leadership
is about creating a world

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:46.720
to which people want to belong.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.360
What kind of world do people
want to belong in at Pixar?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.440
A world where you're
living at the frontier.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.759
What do they focus their time on?

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:55.230
Not on creating a vision.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.360
Instead they spend
their time thinking about,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.200
"How do we design a studio that has
the sensibility of a public square

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.360
so that people will interact?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.030
Let's put in a policy that anyone,
no matter what their level or role,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.960
is allowed to give notes to the director

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.519
about how they feel
about a particular film.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.519
What can we do to make sure

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:18.399
that all the disruptors, all the
minority voices in this organization,

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:20.399
speak up and are heard?

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.020
And, finally, let's bestow credit
in a very generous way."

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.320
I don't know if you've ever looked
at the credits of a Pixar movie,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.480
but the babies born during
a production are listed there.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.879
(Laughter)

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:34.879
How did Bill think about
what his role was?

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:38.360
Bill said, "I lead
a volunteer organization.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.120
Talented people don't want
to follow me anywhere.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.679
They want to cocreate
with me the future.

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.159
My job is to nurture the bottom-up

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:51.519
and not let it degenerate into chaos."

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.840
How did he see his role?

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.639
"I'm a role model,
I'm a human glue,

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.279
I'm a connector,
I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:00.519
I'm never a dictator of viewpoints."

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.639
Advice about how you exercise the role?

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:05.139
Hire people who argue with you.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:06.509
And, guess what?

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:10.140
Sometimes it's best to be
deliberately fuzzy and vague.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.969
Some of you may
be wondering now,

00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:14.840
what are these people thinking?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.850
They're thinking,

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.840
"I'm not the visionary,
I'm the social architect.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.440
I'm creating the space where
people are willing and able

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.789
to share and combine
their talents and passions."

00:14:25.789 --> 00:14:28.919
If some of you are worrying now
that you don't work at a Pixar,

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:30.559
or you don't work at a Google,

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:33.000
I want to tell you there's still hope.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
We've studied many organizations

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.290
that were really not
organizations you'd think of

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.220
as ones where a lot of innovation happens.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.279
We studied a general counsel
in a pharmaceutical company

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:46.000
who had to figure out how
to get the outside lawyers,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.759
19 competitors,
to collaborate and innovate.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:52.609
We studied the head of marketing
at a German automaker

00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:55.890
where, fundamentally, they believed
that it was the design engineers,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:59.009
not the marketeers,
who were allowed to be innovative.

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:03.120
We also studied Vineet Nayar
at HCL Technologies,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.180
an Indian outsourcing company.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.729
When we met Vineet,

00:15:06.729 --> 00:15:10.080
his company was about, in his
words, to become irrelevant.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.099
We watched as he turned that company
into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.560
At HCL technologies,
like at many companies,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.720
the leaders had learned to see
their role as setting direction

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.309
and making sure that
no one deviated from it.

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:31.320
What he did is tell them
it was time for them

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.740
to think about rethinking
what they were supposed to do.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.600
Because what was happening
is that everybody was looking up

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.759
and you weren't seeing
the kind of bottom-up innovation

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:43.119
we saw at Pixar or Google.

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:44.679
So they began to work on that.

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:48.840
They stopped giving answers, they
stopped trying to provide solutions.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.679
Instead, what they did
is they began to see

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:55.556
the people at the bottom of the
pyramid, the young sparks,

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:58.030
the people who were
closest to the customers,

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.580
as the source of innovation.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.713
They began to transfer
the organization's growth

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.236
to that level.

00:16:07.126 --> 00:16:10.879
In Vineet's language, this was
about inverting the pyramid

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:13.919
so that you could unleash
the power of the many

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:16.840
by loosening the stranglehold of the few,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.960
and increase the quality
and the speed of innovation

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.530
that was happening every day.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.389
For sure, Vineet and all the
other leaders that we studied

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:30.520
were in fact visionaries.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.060
For sure, they understood
that that was not their role.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.240
So I don't think it is accidental
that many of you did not recognize Ed.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.919
Because Ed, like Vineet, understands
that our role as leaders

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:49.080
is to set the stage, not perform on it.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.960
If we want to invent a better future,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.240
and I suspect that's why
many of us are here,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.120
then we need to reimagine our task.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.799
Our task is to create the space

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:04.440
where everybody's slices of genius

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.960
can be unleashed and harnessed,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.720
and turned into works
of collective genius.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.790
Thank you.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.780
(Applause)
