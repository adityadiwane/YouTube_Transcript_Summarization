00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.578
There's an old joke about a cop

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.959
who's walking his beat
in the middle of the night,

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.086
and he comes across a guy
under a street lamp

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.801
who's looking at the ground
and moving from side to side,

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:23.602
and the cop asks him what he's doing.

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.560
The guys says he's looking for his keys.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.023
So the cop takes his time

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:29.317
and looks over and kind of
makes a little matrix

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.546
and looks for about two, three minutes.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.721
No keys.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:35.117
The cop says, "Are you sure?

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.450
Hey buddy, are you sure
you lost your keys here?"

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.506
And the guy says,
"No, actually I lost them

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.256
down at the other end of the street,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.725
but the light is better here."

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.374
(Laughter)

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:49.410
There's a concept that people talk
about nowadays called "big data."

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:52.077
And what they're talking
about is all of the information

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:54.252
that we're generating
through our interaction

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:55.579
with and over the Internet,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.363
everything from Facebook and Twitter

00:00:57.387 --> 00:01:01.020
to music downloads, movies,
streaming, all this kind of stuff,

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:02.506
the live streaming of TED.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:05.603
And the folks who work
with big data, for them,

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.631
they talk about that their biggest problem

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.402
is we have so much information.

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.803
The biggest problem is: how do we
organize all that information?

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.432
I can tell you that,
working in global health,

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.740
that is not our biggest problem.

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.416
Because for us, even though
the light is better on the Internet,

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:26.355
the data that would help us solve
the problems we're trying to solve

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.528
is not actually present on the Internet.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:29.997
So we don't know, for example,

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:33.312
how many people right now
are being affected by disasters

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.305
or by conflict situations.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.048
We don't know for, really,
basically, any of the clinics

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.222
in the developing world,

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:42.701
which ones have medicines
and which ones don't.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:46.099
We have no idea of what
the supply chain is for those clinics.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:49.821
We don't know -- and this is really
amazing to me -- we don't know

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:53.615
how many children were born --
or how many children there are --

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:57.047
in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.

00:01:58.047 --> 00:02:00.088
We don't know how many kids died last week

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:01.358
in any of those countries.

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:04.429
We don't know the needs
of the elderly, the mentally ill.

00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:07.668
For all of these different
critically important problems

00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:10.992
or critically important areas
that we want to solve problems in,

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.282
we basically know nothing at all.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.486
And part of the reason
why we don't know anything at all

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.689
is that the information technology systems
that we use in global health

00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:27.126
to find the data to solve
these problems is what you see here.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.384
This is about a 5,000-year-old technology.

00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:31.140
Some of you may have used it before.

00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:32.703
It's kind of on its way out now,

00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:35.166
but we still use it
for 99 percent of our stuff.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.680
This is a paper form.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.043
And what you're looking at is a paper form

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:43.246
in the hand of a Ministry of Health
nurse in Indonesia,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.510
who is tramping out across the countryside

00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:49.185
in Indonesia on, I'm sure,
a very hot and humid day,

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.891
and she is going to be knocking
on thousands of doors

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.994
over a period of weeks or months,

00:02:54.018 --> 00:02:55.615
knocking on the doors and saying,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.517
"Excuse me, we'd like to ask
you some questions.

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.746
Do you have any children?
Were your children vaccinated?"

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.358
Because the only way
we can actually find out

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:07.317
how many children were vaccinated
in the country of Indonesia,

00:03:07.341 --> 00:03:08.898
what percentage were vaccinated,

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:13.050
is actually not on the Internet,
but by going out and knocking on doors,

00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:15.288
sometimes tens of thousands of doors.

00:03:15.312 --> 00:03:19.310
Sometimes it takes months to even years
to do something like this.

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:21.451
You know, a census of Indonesia

00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:23.569
would probably take
two years to accomplish.

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.665
And the problem, of course,
with all of this

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.586
is that, with all those paper forms --

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.729
and I'm telling you, we have
paper forms for every possible thing:

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:32.817
We have paper forms
for vaccination surveys.

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:36.002
We have paper forms to track
people who come into clinics.

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:40.068
We have paper forms to track
drug supplies, blood supplies --

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:43.326
all these different paper forms
for many different topics,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.666
they all have a single, common endpoint,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.309
and the common endpoint
looks something like this.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:51.666
And what we're looking
at here is a truckful of data.

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.126
This is the data from a single
vaccination coverage survey

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.341
in a single district
in the country of Zambia

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:01.655
from a few years ago,
that I participated in.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:04.026
The only thing anyone
was trying to find out

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.303
is what percentage of Zambian
children are vaccinated,

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:10.581
and this is the data,
collected on paper over weeks,

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:11.788
from a single district,

00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:14.487
which is something like a county
in the United States.

00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:17.186
You can imagine that,
for the entire country of Zambia,

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.503
answering just that single question ...

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:21.945
looks something like this.

00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:25.112
Truck after truck after truck,

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:28.049
filled with stack after stack
after stack of data.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.642
And what makes it even worse
is that's just the beginning.

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.760
Because once you've collected
all that data,

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:36.324
of course, someone --
some unfortunate person --

00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:38.563
is going to have to type that
into a computer.

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:40.039
When I was a graduate student,

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.522
I actually was that unfortunate
person sometimes.

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:45.561
I can tell you, I often wasn't
really paying attention.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.852
I probably made a lot
of mistakes when I did it

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:50.496
that no one ever discovered,
so data quality goes down.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.540
But eventually that data, hopefully,
gets typed into a computer,

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.295
and someone can begin to analyze it,

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.191
and once they have
an analysis and a report,

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:01.239
hopefully, then you can take
the results of that data collection

00:05:01.263 --> 00:05:03.230
and use it to vaccinate children better.

00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:08.795
Because if there's anything worse
in the field of global public health --

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.801
I don't know what's worse
than allowing children on this planet

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:13.941
to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:17.377
diseases for which
the vaccine costs a dollar.

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:21.187
And millions of children die
of these diseases every year.

00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:24.185
And the fact is, millions
is a gross estimate,

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:27.423
because we don't really know
how many kids die each year of this.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.229
What makes it even more frustrating
is that the data-entry part,

00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:33.443
the part that I used to do
as a grad student,

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:34.925
can take sometimes six months.

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.401
Sometimes it can take two years
to type that information into a computer,

00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:40.535
And sometimes, actually not infrequently,

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.387
it actually never happens.

00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:44.887
Now try and wrap your head
around that for a second.

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.086
You just had teams of hundreds of people.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.013
They went out into the field
to answer a particular question.

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:52.433
You probably spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:55.493
on fuel and photocopying and per diem.

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.116
And then for some reason, momentum is lost

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.533
or there's no money left,

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.894
and all of that comes to nothing,

00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:04.641
because no one actually types it
into the computer at all.

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:05.841
The process just stops.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.789
Happens all the time.

00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:10.928
This is what we base
our decisions on in global health:

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:14.369
little data, old data, no data.

00:06:15.924 --> 00:06:17.377
So back in 1995,

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:20.641
I began to think about ways
in which we could improve this process.

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:23.333
Now 1995 -- obviously,
that was quite a long time ago.

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:26.335
It kind of frightens me to think
of how long ago that was.

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:29.097
The top movie of the year
was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.938
As you can see, Bruce Willis
had a lot more hair back then.

00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:34.627
I was working in the Centers
for Disease Control

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:36.830
and I had a lot more
hair back then as well.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:40.449
But to me, the most significant
thing that I saw in 1995

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:41.691
was this.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.544
Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,

00:06:44.568 --> 00:06:47.683
this was the ultimate elite mobile device.

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:50.842
It wasn't an iPhone.
It wasn't a Galaxy phone.

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:52.230
It was a PalmPilot.

00:06:52.254 --> 00:06:55.782
And when I saw the PalmPilot
for the first time, I thought,

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:58.203
"Why can't we put the forms
on these PalmPilots?

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:01.378
And go out into the field
just carrying one PalmPilot,

00:07:01.402 --> 00:07:05.167
which can hold the capacity
of tens of thousands of paper forms?

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.618
Why don't we try to do that?

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:07.905
Because if we can do that,

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.738
if we can actually just collect
the data electronically, digitally,

00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:13.419
from the very beginning,

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:16.719
we can just put a shortcut right
through that whole process

00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:21.735
of typing, of having somebody type
that stuff into the computer.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.599
We can skip straight to the analysis

00:07:23.623 --> 00:07:26.762
and then straight to the use
of the data to actually save lives."

00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:29.373
So that's what I began to do.

00:07:29.397 --> 00:07:33.746
Working at CDC, I began to travel
to different programs around the world

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.912
and to train them in using
PalmPilots to do data collection,

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:39.314
instead of using paper.

00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:41.226
And it actually worked great.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.302
It worked exactly as well
as anybody would have predicted.

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:45.483
What do you know?

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.119
Digital data collection is actually
more efficient than collecting on paper.

00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:51.175
While I was doing it, my business partner,

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.278
Rose, who's here with her husband,
Matthew, here in the audience,

00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:57.175
Rose was out doing similar stuff
for the American Red Cross.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.585
The problem was,
after a few years of doing that,

00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:03.506
I realized -- I had been to maybe
six or seven programs --

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.791
and I thought, you know,
if I keep this up at this pace,

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:07.966
over my whole career,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.669
maybe I'm going to go
to maybe 20 or 30 programs.

00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:13.836
But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.810
like, training 20 or 30 programs
to use this technology,

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:19.000
that is a tiny drop in the bucket.

00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:22.964
The demand for this, the need
for data to run better programs

00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:25.846
just within health -- not to mention
all of the other fields

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.866
in developing countries -- is enormous.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.876
There are millions and millions
and millions of programs,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.468
millions of clinics
that need to track drugs,

00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:35.896
millions of vaccine programs.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.181
There are schools
that need to track attendance.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:42.111
There are all these different things
for us to get the data that we need to do.

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:46.754
And I realized if I kept up
the way that I was doing,

00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:49.998
I was basically hardly
going to make any impact

00:08:50.022 --> 00:08:51.375
by the end of my career.

00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:53.624
And so I began to rack my brain,

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:56.592
trying to think about, what
was the process that I was doing?

00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:57.898
How was I training folks,

00:08:57.922 --> 00:09:01.096
and what were the bottlenecks
and what were the obstacles

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.815
to doing it faster
and to doing it more efficiently?

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.675
And, unfortunately, after thinking
about this for some time,

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.870
I identified the main obstacle.

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:12.396
And the main obstacle, it turned out --

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.008
and this is a sad realization --

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:15.745
the main obstacle was me.

00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:17.658
So what do I mean by that?

00:09:18.538 --> 00:09:20.254
I had developed a process

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:24.645
whereby I was the center
of the universe of this technology.

00:09:26.304 --> 00:09:29.627
If you wanted to use this technology,
you had to get in touch with me.

00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:31.475
That means you had to know I existed.

00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:34.912
Then you had to find the money
to pay for me to fly out to your country

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:38.531
and the money to pay for my hotel
and my per diem and my daily rate.

00:09:38.555 --> 00:09:41.554
So you could be talking
about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,

00:09:41.578 --> 00:09:43.872
if I actually had the time
or it fit my schedule

00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:45.245
and I wasn't on vacation.

00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:47.555
The point is that anything,

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:49.942
any system that depends
on a single human being

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:51.869
or two or three or five human beings --

00:09:51.893 --> 00:09:53.546
it just doesn't scale.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.769
And this is a problem for which
we need to scale this technology,

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:58.363
and we need to scale it now.

00:09:58.387 --> 00:10:01.141
And so I began to think of ways
in which I could basically

00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:03.753
take myself out of the picture.

00:10:06.071 --> 00:10:07.715
And, you know, I was thinking,

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.843
"How could I take myself
out of the picture?"

00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:11.486
for quite some time.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.986
I'd been trained that the way
you distribute technology

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.566
within international development

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.152
is always consultant-based.

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:21.177
It's always guys
that look pretty much like me,

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:23.749
flying from countries
that look pretty much like this

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:26.112
to other countries
with people with darker skin.

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:29.231
And you go out there,
and you spend money on airfare

00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:32.491
and you spend time and you spend per diem

00:10:32.515 --> 00:10:34.864
and you spend for a hotel
and all that stuff.

00:10:34.888 --> 00:10:38.300
As far as I knew, that was the only way
you could distribute technology,

00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:40.359
and I couldn't figure out a way around it.

00:10:40.383 --> 00:10:42.137
But the miracle that happened --

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.757
I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.

00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.591
You may not think of Hotmail
as being miraculous,

00:10:47.615 --> 00:10:49.052
but for me it was miraculous,

00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:52.688
because I noticed, just as I
was wrestling with this problem --

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:56.218
I was working in sub-Saharan
Africa, mostly, at the time --

00:10:56.242 --> 00:10:58.807
I noticed that every sub-Saharan
African health worker

00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.775
that I was working with
had a Hotmail account.

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:06.317
And it struck me, "Wait a minute --

00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:10.579
I know the Hotmail people surely didn't
fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.679
to train people in how to use Hotmail.

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:17.630
So these guys are distributing technology,
getting software capacity out there,

00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:19.982
but they're not actually
flying around the world.

00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:21.578
I need to think about this more."

00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:23.052
While I was thinking about it,

00:11:23.076 --> 00:11:26.235
people started using even more
things like this, just as we were.

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:29.490
They started using LinkedIn and Flickr
and Gmail and Google Maps --

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:30.671
all these things.

00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:33.386
Of course, all of these things
are cloud based

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.559
and don't require any training.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.259
They don't require any programmers.

00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:38.786
They don't require consultants.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.295
Because the business model
for all these businesses

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:44.256
requires that something be so simple
we can use it ourselves,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.574
with little or no training.

00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:48.193
You just have to hear about it
and go to the website.

00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:52.413
And so I thought, what would happen
if we built software

00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:54.501
to do what I'd been consulting in?

00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:58.597
Instead of training people
how to put forms onto mobile devices,

00:11:58.621 --> 00:12:01.922
let's create software that lets them
do it themselves with no training

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:03.382
and without me being involved.

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:04.890
And that's exactly what we did.

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:10.135
So we created software called Magpi,
which has an online form creator.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:11.411
No one has to speak to me,

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:14.236
you just have to hear about it
and go to the website.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.918
You can create forms,
and once you've created the forms,

00:12:16.942 --> 00:12:19.403
you push them to a variety
of common mobile phones.

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:22.944
Obviously, nowadays, we've moved
past PalmPilots to mobile phones.

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:26.197
And it doesn't have to be a smartphone,
it can be a basic phone,

00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:28.711
like the phone on the right,
the basic Symbian phone

00:12:28.735 --> 00:12:30.797
that's very common
in developing countries.

00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:34.510
And the great part about this
is it's just like Hotmail.

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:35.685
It's cloud based,

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:38.962
and it doesn't require any training,
programming, consultants.

00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.189
But there are some
additional benefits as well.

00:12:41.213 --> 00:12:43.086
Now we knew when we built this system,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.665
the whole point of it,
just like with the PalmPilots,

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:48.488
was that you'd be able to collect the data

00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:51.110
and immediately upload
the data and get your data set.

00:12:51.134 --> 00:12:54.119
But what we found, of course,
since it's already on a computer,

00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:56.754
we can deliver instant maps
and analysis and graphing.

00:12:56.778 --> 00:12:58.849
We can take a process that took two years

00:12:58.873 --> 00:13:01.881
and compress that
down to the space of five minutes.

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:04.377
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.448
Cloud based, no training,
no consultants, no me.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.791
And I told you that in the first few years

00:13:11.815 --> 00:13:13.884
of trying to do this
the old-fashioned way,

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:15.187
going out to each country,

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:19.432
we probably trained about 1,000 people.

00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:21.553
What happened after we did this?

00:13:21.577 --> 00:13:23.038
In the second three years,

00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:25.212
we had 14,000 people find the website,

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:27.349
sign up and start using it
to collect data:

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.283
data for disaster response,

00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:33.741
Canadian pig farmers
tracking pig disease and pig herds,

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:35.646
people tracking drug supplies.

00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:39.585
One of my favorite examples, the IRC,
International Rescue Committee,

00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:42.822
they have a program
where semi-literate midwives,

00:13:42.846 --> 00:13:45.249
using $10 mobile phones,

00:13:45.273 --> 00:13:48.574
send a text message
using our software, once a week,

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:51.074
with the number of births
and the number of deaths,

00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:54.670
which gives IRC something that no one
in global health has ever had:

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:58.216
a near-real-time system
of counting babies,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.874
of knowing how many kids are born,

00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:02.540
of knowing how many children
there are in Sierra Leone,

00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:04.787
which is the country
where this is happening,

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.564
and knowing how many children die.

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.967
Physicians for Human Rights --

00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:11.583
this is moving a little bit
outside the health field --

00:14:11.607 --> 00:14:16.390
they're basically training people
to do rape exams in Congo,

00:14:16.414 --> 00:14:17.863
where this is an epidemic,

00:14:17.887 --> 00:14:19.680
a horrible epidemic,

00:14:19.704 --> 00:14:22.880
and they're using our software
to document the evidence they find,

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.878
including photographically,

00:14:24.902 --> 00:14:27.805
so that they can bring
the perpetrators to justice.

00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:32.549
Camfed, another charity
based out of the UK --

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:35.286
Camfed pays girls' families
to keep them in school.

00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:39.640
They understand this is the most
significant intervention they can make.

00:14:39.664 --> 00:14:43.504
They used to track the disbursements,
the attendance, the grades, on paper.

00:14:43.528 --> 00:14:46.875
The turnaround time between a teacher
writing down grades or attendance

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:49.734
and getting that into a report
was about two to three years.

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:50.909
Now it's real time.

00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:54.116
And because this is such a low-cost
system and based in the cloud,

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.129
it costs, for the entire five countries
that Camfed runs this in,

00:14:58.153 --> 00:15:00.018
with tens of thousands of girls,

00:15:00.042 --> 00:15:02.750
the whole cost combined
is 10,000 dollars a year.

00:15:03.154 --> 00:15:05.115
That's less than I used to get

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:08.035
just traveling out for two weeks
to do a consultation.

00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:13.608
So I told you before that when
we were doing it the old-fashioned way,

00:15:13.632 --> 00:15:17.427
I realized all of our work was really
adding up to just a drop in the bucket --

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:19.173
10, 20, 30 different programs.

00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:21.449
We've made a lot of progress,

00:15:21.473 --> 00:15:23.029
but I recognize that right now,

00:15:23.053 --> 00:15:26.417
even the work that we've done
with 14,000 people using this

00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:27.904
is still a drop in the bucket.

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.658
But something's changed,
and I think it should be obvious.

00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:32.837
What's changed now is,

00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:36.163
instead of having a program
in which we're scaling at such a slow rate

00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:39.498
that we can never reach
all the people who need us,

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:43.104
we've made it unnecessary
for people to get reached by us.

00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:48.131
We've created a tool
that lets programs keep kids in school,

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:52.094
track the number of babies that are born
and the number of babies that die,

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.895
catch criminals and successfully
prosecute them --

00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:00.341
to do all these different things
to learn more about what's going on,

00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:01.666
to understand more,

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.006
to see more ...

00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:05.816
and to save lives and improve lives.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.072
Thank you.

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:13.365
(Applause)
