00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.742
My passions

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:20.431
are music, technology and making things.

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.614
And it's the combination of these things

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:26.310
that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.388
and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.

00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:32.765
This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.511
and I have one here tonight.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:36.036
It's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.371
it's got a hundred or so holes on top,

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.124
on that side is the speaker, and here

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.300
is some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.901
of propane.

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:47.716
So, let's fire it up and see what it does.

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:55.038
So let's play a 550-herz frequency

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:56.553
and watch what happens.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:01:05.085
(Frequency)

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.798
Thank you. (Applause)

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:09.786
It's okay to applaud the laws of physics,

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:11.242
but essentially what's happening here

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.002
-- (Laughter) --

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:17.010
is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.514
is influencing the combustion properties of propane,

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:21.418
creating a visible waveform,

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:23.738
and we can see the alternating regions of compression

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:25.778
and rarefaction that we call frequency,

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:27.522
and the height is showing us amplitude.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.850
So let's change the frequency of the sound,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.275
and watch what happens to the fire.

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:41.405
(Higher frequency)

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.755
So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:46.455
and that emergent sine curve of fire.

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:48.033
So let's turn that off. We're indoors.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:53.624
Thank you. (Applause)

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:55.971
I also have with me a flame table.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:57.536
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.657
for visualizing the physical properties of sound,

00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:01.625
such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.875
and see what it does.

00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:12.020
Ooh. (Laughter)

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.994
Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,

00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:16.666
let me note here that the sound is not traveling

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:19.412
in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.521
and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.517
with a line, and the flame table's a little like

00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:26.371
bisecting those waves with a plane,

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:30.371
and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.724
I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.

00:02:32.724 --> 00:03:15.005
(Music)

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.770
All right, so it's a delicate dance.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.315
If you watch closely â€” (Applause)

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:22.082
If you watch closely, you may have seen

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:24.554
some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:29.171
that jazz music is better with fire.

00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.181
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.613
but the fire's just a foundation.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.761
It shows very well that eyes can hear,

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.156
and this is interesting to me because

00:03:36.156 --> 00:03:39.010
technology allows us to present sound to the eyes

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.873
in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes

00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:44.570
for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.954
So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:50.417
the frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.457
in a way that the eyes can take them in

00:03:52.457 --> 00:03:54.701
as a single visual impression, and the technique

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.674
will also show the strengths of the visual cortex

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.290
for pattern recognition.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.169
So if I show you another song off this album,

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.650
and another, your eyes will easily pick out

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.578
the use of repetition by the band Nirvana,

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:08.435
and in the frequency distribution, the colors,

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.483
you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:12.690
that they are famous for,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.690
and here is the entire album as a single visual impression,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.570
and I think this impression is pretty powerful.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.284
At least, it's powerful enough that

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:21.626
if I show you these four songs,

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:24.067
and I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:26.386
you can probably correctly guess, without listening

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:27.820
to any music at all, that the song

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.114
a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:32.370
"I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.370
whose lead singer is Dave Grohl,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.148
who was the drummer in Nirvana.

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:39.448
The songs are a little similar, but mostly

00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:41.074
I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:45.486
we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:46.586
All right, now for some more sound data.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.238
This is data from a skate park,

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.270
and this is Mabel Davis skate park

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.412
in Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)

00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:54.786
And the sounds you're hearing came from eight

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:57.002
microphones attached to obstacles around the park,

00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:59.186
and it sounds like chaos, but actually

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:02.533
all the tricks start with a very distinct slap,

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.137
but successful tricks end with a pop,

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.930
whereas unsuccessful tricks

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.786
more of a scratch and a tumble,

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:11.796
and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and

00:05:11.796 --> 00:05:14.586
voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.524
So if we were to render these sounds visually,

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.931
we might end up with something like this.

00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:20.387
This is all 40 minutes of the recording,

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.547
and right away the algorithm tells us

00:05:22.547 --> 00:05:24.620
a lot more tricks are missed than are made,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.955
and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:29.827
to produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,

00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:31.560
we can tease out traffic patterns.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.647
You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.

00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.352
And in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:42.156
but later in the recording, this kid shows up,

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:45.084
and he starts using a line at the top of the park

00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:46.886
to do some very advanced tricks on something

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:47.989
called the tall rail.

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:49.861
And it's fascinating. At this moment in time,

00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:53.364
all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees

00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:55.142
to stay out of his way.

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:57.685
You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,

00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:59.285
and it's led by key influencers,

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:02.533
and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:04.963
or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:08.864
All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.

00:06:08.864 --> 00:06:10.480
I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.816
and I wanted to use all eight hours

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:14.403
of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.467
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:20.571
which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.997
fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.

00:06:23.997 --> 00:06:25.957
It listens to the lecture, and then it uses

00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:28.644
the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:31.277
and it uses the inflection of sentences

00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:33.431
to move a same point up and down on the y-axis.

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:36.205
And these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:38.075
than answers in the laws of physics,

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:40.108
and when we reach the end of a sentence,

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.443
we place a star at that location.

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:45.243
So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:47.599
and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.528
This is Stephen Hawking's universe.

00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:57.465
(Applause)

00:06:57.465 --> 00:06:59.952
It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.800
taken in as a single visual impression,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.557
and I really like this image,

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.365
but a lot of people think it's fake.

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:07.709
So I made a more interactive version,

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:13.165
and the way I did that is I used their position in time

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:15.532
in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,

00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:17.933
and with some custom software and a Kinect,

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:20.596
I can walk right into the lecture.

00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:22.396
I'm going to wave through the Kinect here

00:07:22.396 --> 00:07:24.228
and take control, and now I'm going to reach out

00:07:24.228 --> 00:07:27.467
and I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.411
it will play the sentence

00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:30.876
that generated that star.

00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:34.692
Stephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:37.491
in which the pieces make a complete picture.

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.639
Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.812
There are 1,400 stars.

00:07:44.812 --> 00:07:46.476
It's a really fun way to explore the lecture,

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:47.943
and, I hope, a fitting homage.

00:07:47.943 --> 00:07:53.415
All right. Let me close with a work in progress.

00:07:53.415 --> 00:07:56.398
I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists

00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.502
to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.

00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:00.621
Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,

00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.548
so let's watch one now with the sound turned off

00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:07.470
and the closed captioning turned on.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.616
There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,

00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:11.729
and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:13.098
you hear it in your mind's ear,

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:16.081
and then applause starts.

00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:18.271
It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:20.248
Sometimes you get a little star applause,

00:08:20.248 --> 00:08:22.734
and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.424
and the talk begins.

00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:30.122
All right, so let's watch this clip again.

00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:31.378
This time, I'm not going to talk at all.

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:32.745
There's still going to be no audio,

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.649
but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:38.965
visually in real time at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:41.756
So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.020
This is fairly amazing to me.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.353
Even on the first view, your eyes will successfully

00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:11.441
pick out patterns, but on repeated views,

00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:13.130
your brain actually gets better

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.786
at turning these patterns into information.

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:16.377
You can get the tone and the timbre

00:09:16.377 --> 00:09:17.600
and the pace of the speech,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.664
things that you can't get out of closed captioning.

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.848
That famous scene in horror movies

00:09:21.848 --> 00:09:24.496
where someone is walking up from behind

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:26.456
is something you can see,

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:29.160
and I believe this information would be something

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.963
that is useful at times when the audio is turned off

00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:34.904
or not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:36.081
might actually even be better

00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.862
at seeing sound than hearing audiences.

00:09:37.862 --> 00:09:39.360
I don't know. It's a theory right now.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.881
Actually, it's all just an idea.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:45.072
And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,

00:09:45.072 --> 00:09:47.049
and so do ideas.
