(Music)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
♫ Here we stand ♫

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
♫ Like an Adam and an Eve ♫

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.260
♫ Waterfalls ♫

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
♫ The Garden of Eden ♫

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
♫ Two fools in love ♫

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
♫ So beautiful and strong ♫

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
♫ Birds in the trees ♫

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.260
♫ Are smiling upon them ♫

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
♫ From the age of the dinosaurs ♫

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
♫ Cars would run on gasoline ♫

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
♫ Where? Where have they gone? ♫

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260
♫ Now, there's nothing but flowers ♫

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
♫ This was a factory ♫

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
♫Now there are mountains and rivers ♫

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
♫ We caught a rattlesnake ♫

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
♫ Now we've got something for dinner ♫

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
♫ This was a parking lot ♫

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
♫ Now it's all covered with flowers ♫

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
♫ If this is paradise ♫

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.260
♫ I wish I had a lawnmower ♫

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
♫ This was a shopping mall ♫

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
♫ Now it's turned into corn field ♫

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
♫ Don't leave me stranded here ♫

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.260
♫ I can't get used to this lifestyle ♫

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
(Applause)

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
