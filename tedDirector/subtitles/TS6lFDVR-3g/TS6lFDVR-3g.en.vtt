00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.396
It's six o'clock in the morning,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.740
pitch black outside.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.676
My 14-year-old son
is fast asleep in his bed,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.780
sleeping the reckless,
deep sleep of a teenager.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.796
I flip on the light and physically
shake the poor boy awake,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.436
because I know that,
like ripping off a Band-Aid,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.396
it's better to get it over with quickly.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.076
(Laughter)

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.836
I have a friend who yells "Fire!"
just to rouse her sleeping teen.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.836
And another who got so fed up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.716
that she had to dump cold water
on her son's head

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.660
just to get him out of bed.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.156
Sound brutal ...

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.980
but perhaps familiar?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.276
Every morning I ask myself,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.876
"How can I --

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.636
knowing what I know

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.076
and doing what I do for a living --

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
be doing this to my own son?"

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.156
You see,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.876
I'm a sleep researcher.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.076
(Laughter)

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.916
So I know far too much about sleep

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.636
and the consequences of sleep loss.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.756
I know that I'm depriving my son
of the sleep he desperately needs

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:18.660
as a rapidly growing teenager.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.436
I also know that by waking him up

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.116
hours before his natural
biological clock tells him he's ready,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.540
I'm literally robbing him
of his dreams --

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.996
the type of sleep most associated
with learning, memory consolidation

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.860
and emotional processing.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.460
But it's not just my kid
that's being deprived of sleep.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.340
Sleep deprivation among
American teenagers is an epidemic.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.676
Only about one in 10 gets
the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.900
recommended by sleep scientists
and pediatricians.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.836
Now, if you're thinking to yourself,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.116
"Phew, we're doing good,
my kid's getting eight hours,"

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.356
remember,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.876
eight hours is
the minimum recommendation.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.956
You're barely passing.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.820
Eight hours is kind of like
getting a C on your report card.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.620
There are many factors
contributing to this epidemic,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.956
but a major factor preventing teens
from getting the sleep they need

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.299
is actually a matter of public policy.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.860
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.596
Across the country,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.476
many schools are starting
around 7:30am or earlier,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.596
despite the fact that major
medical organizations recommend

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060
that middle and high school
start no earlier than 8:30am.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.196
These early start policies
have a direct effect on how much --

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.220
or really how little sleep
American teenagers are getting.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.236
They're also pitting
teenagers and their parents

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340
in a fundamentally unwinnable fight
against their own bodies.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.996
Around the time of puberty,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.756
teenagers experience a delay
in their biological clock,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.460
which determines when we feel most awake
and when we feel most sleepy.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.980
This is driven in part by a shift
in the release of the hormone melatonin.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.436
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing
melatonin until around 11pm,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.780
which is two hours later than what
we see in adults or younger children.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.676
This means that waking a teenager up
at 6am is the biological equivalent

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.660
of waking an adult up at 4am.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.556
On the unfortunate days
when I have to wake up at 4am,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.916
I'm a zombie.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.676
Functionally useless.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.316
I can't think straight,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.836
I'm irritable,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.300
and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.620
But this is how many American
teenagers feel every single school day.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.116
In fact, many of the, shall we say,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.476
unpleasant characteristics
that we chalk up to being a teenager --

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.916
moodiness, irritability,
laziness, depression --

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.820
could be a product
of chronic sleep deprivation.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.636
For many teens
battling chronic sleep loss,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.156
their go-to strategy to compensate
is consuming large quantities of caffeine

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.356
in the form of venti frappuccinos,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.220
or energy drinks and shots.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.116
So essentially,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.140
we've got an entire population
of tired but wired youth.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.036
Advocates of sleep-friendly
start times know

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.596
that adolescence is a period
of dramatic brain development,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.676
particularly in the parts of the brain

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.236
that are responsible for those
higher order thinking processes,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.540
including reasoning, problem-solving
and good judgment.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.276
In other words, the very type
of brain activity that's responsible

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.876
for reining in those impulsive
and often risky behaviors

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.836
that are so characteristic of adolescence

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.620
and that are so terrifying
to us parents of teenagers.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.316
They know that like the rest of us,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.756
when teenagers don't
get the sleep they need,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.916
their brains, their bodies
and behaviors suffer

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.580
with both immediate and lasting effects.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.916
They can't concentrate,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.836
their attention plummets

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.620
and many will even show
behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.556
But the consequences of teen sleep loss
go well beyond the classroom,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.196
sadly contributing to many
of the mental health problems

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.916
that skyrocket during adolescence,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.756
including substance use,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.260
depression and suicide.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.396
In our work with teens
from LA Unified School District,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.636
we found that teens with sleep problems

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.860
were 55 percent more likely
to have used alcohol in the past month.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.796
In another study with over
30,000 high school students,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.396
they found that
for each hour of lost sleep,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.140
there was a 38 percent increase
in feeling sad or hopeless,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.100
and a 58 percent increase
in teen suicide attempts.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.676
And if that's not enough,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.236
teens who skip out on sleep
are at increased risk

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.316
for a host of physical health problems
that plague our country,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.420
including obesity,
heart disease and diabetes.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.476
Then there's the risk
of putting a sleep-deprived teen,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.036
with a newly minted driver's license,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.340
behind the wheel.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.476
Studies have shown that getting five hours
or less of sleep per night

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.180
is the equivalent of driving with a blood
alcohol content above the legal limit.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.516
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.596
and researchers in this area,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.796
have produced tremendous science

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.716
showing the tremendous benefits
of later start times.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.036
The findings are unequivocal,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.756
and as a sleep scientist,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.500
I rarely get to speak
with that kind of certainty.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.796
Teens from districts
with later start times get more sleep.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.316
To the naysayers who may think
that if schools start later,

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.980
teens will just stay up later,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.996
the truth is,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.956
their bedtimes stay the same,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.236
but their wake-up times get extended,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.420
resulting in more sleep.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.556
They're more likely to show up for school;

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.476
school absences dropped
by 25 percent in one district.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.076
And they're less likely to drop out.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.596
Not surprisingly,
they do better academically.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.356
So this has real implications
for reducing the achievement gap.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.076
Standardized test scores
in math and reading

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.540
go up by two to three percentage points.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.716
That's as powerful as reducing class sizes
by one-third fewer students,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.916
or replacing a so-so teacher
in the classroom

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.100
with a truly outstanding one.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.796
Their mental and physical health improves,

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.156
and even their families are happier.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.996
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little
more pleasantness from our teens,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.980
and a little less crankiness?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.716
Even their communities are safer

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.276
because car crash rates go down --

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.140
a 70 percent reduction in one district.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.636
Given these tremendous benefits,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.996
you might think,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.716
well, this is a no-brainer, right?

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.020
So why have we as a society
failed to heed this call?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.060
Often the argument against later
start times goes something like this:

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.116
"Why should we delay
start times for teenagers?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.380
We need to toughen them up
so they're ready for the real world!"

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.916
But that's like saying
to the parent of a two-year-old,

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.436
"Don't let Johnny nap,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.876
or he won't be ready for kindergarten."

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.100
(Laughter)

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.596
Delaying start times also presents
many logistical challenges.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.996
Not just for students and their families,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.396
but for communities as a whole.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.996
Updating bus routes,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.076
increased transportation costs,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.636
impact on sports,

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.076
care before or after school.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.676
These are the same concerns
that come up in district after district,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.676
time and again around the country

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.780
as school start times are debated.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.460
And they're legitimate concerns,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.340
but these are problems
we have to work through.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.196
They are not valid excuses

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.980
for failing to do the right thing
for our children,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.620
which is to start middle and high schools
no earlier than 8:30am.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.476
And in districts around the country,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.116
big and small,
who have made this change,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.916
they found that these fears
are often unfounded

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.356
and far outweighed by the tremendous
benefits for student health

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.036
and performance,

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.020
and our collective public safety.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.756
So tomorrow morning,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.500
when coincidentally we get
to set our clocks back by an hour

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.900
and you get that delicious
extra hour of sleep,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.060
and the day seems a little longer,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.540
and a little more full of hope,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.500
think about the tremendous power of sleep.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.916
And think about what a gift it would be

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.956
for our children to be able
to wake up naturally,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.220
in harmony with their own biology.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.476
Thank you,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.700
and pleasant dreams.
