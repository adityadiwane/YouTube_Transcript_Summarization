00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:14.912
I am a palliative care physician

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.927
and I would like to talk to you
today about health care.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.102
I'd like to talk to you
about the health and care

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.764
of the most vulnerable
population in our country --

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:31.039
those people dealing with the most
complex serious health issues.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.004
I'd like to talk to you
about economics as well.

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.484
And the intersection of these two
should scare the hell out of you --

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:41.279
it scares the hell out of me.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.874
I'd also like to talk to you
about palliative medicine:

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:52.152
a paradigm of care for this population,
grounded in what they value.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:55.741
Patient-centric care based on their values

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.342
that helps this population
live better and longer.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.808
It's a care model that tells the truth

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:04.984
and engages one-on-one

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:06.829
and meets people where they're at.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.223
I'd like to start by telling the story
of my very first patient.

00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:15.283
It was my first day as a physician,

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.798
with the long white coat ...

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.001
I stumbled into the hospital

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.825
and right away there's a gentleman,
Harold, 68 years old,

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.450
came to the emergency department.

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:25.457
He had had headaches for about six weeks

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.630
that got worse and worse
and worse and worse.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.093
Evaluation revealed he had cancer
that had spread to his brain.

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:38.443
The attending physician directed me
to go share with Harold and his family

00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:43.113
the diagnosis, the prognosis
and options of care.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:47.068
Five hours into my new career,

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:49.126
I did the only thing I knew how.

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.206
I walked in,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.134
sat down,

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:55.137
took Harold's hand,

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:57.290
took his wife's hand

00:01:58.142 --> 00:01:59.419
and just breathed.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.701
He said, "It's not good
news is it, sonny?"

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:04.540
I said, "No."

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:07.915
And so we talked
and we listened and we shared.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:10.100
And after a while I said,

00:02:10.124 --> 00:02:13.349
"Harold, what is it
that has meaning to you?

00:02:13.373 --> 00:02:15.002
What is it that you hold sacred?"

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:16.341
And he said,

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.769
"My family."

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.546
I said, "What do you want to do?"

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.737
He slapped me on the knee
and said, "I want to go fishing."

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:25.632
I said, "That, I know how to do."

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.600
Harold went fishing the next day.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.392
He died a week later.

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.074
As I've gone through
my training in my career,

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.585
I think back to Harold.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.029
And I think that this is a conversation

00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:42.966
that happens far too infrequently.

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:47.502
And it's a conversation
that had led us to crisis,

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.837
to the biggest threat
to the American way of life today,

00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:52.967
which is health care expenditures.

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:55.103
So what do we know?

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:58.056
We know that
this population, the most ill,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.664
takes up 15 percent
of the gross domestic product --

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:03.482
nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:07.867
So the sickest 15 percent
take up 15 percent of the GDP.

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:11.056
If we extrapolate this out
over the next two decades

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:13.746
with the growth of baby boomers,

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:18.754
at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.

00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:22.456
Sixty percent of the gross
domestic product

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.104
of the United States of America --

00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:26.822
it has very little to do
with health care at that point.

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:28.962
It has to do with a gallon of milk,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.064
with college tuition.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:34.088
It has to do with
every thing that we value

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.237
and every thing that we know presently.

00:03:38.514 --> 00:03:42.705
It has at stake the free-market
economy and capitalism

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.483
of the United States of America.

00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:50.121
Let's forget all the statistics
for a minute, forget the numbers.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:53.525
Let's talk about the value we get
for all these dollars we spend.

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:57.415
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,
about six years ago,

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.192
looked at every dollar
spent by Medicare --

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:01.827
generally this population.

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:05.787
We found that those patients who have
the highest per capita expenditures

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.425
had the highest suffering,
pain, depression.

00:04:12.182 --> 00:04:14.743
And, more often than not, they die sooner.

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:17.349
How can this be?

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.193
We live in the United States,

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.707
it has the greatest health care
system on the planet.

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.236
We spend 10 times more on these patients

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.446
than the second-leading
country in the world.

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:28.649
That doesn't make sense.

00:04:29.764 --> 00:04:31.123
But what we know is,

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:34.318
out of the top 50 countries on the planet

00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:37.925
with organized health care systems,

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.047
we rank 37th.

00:04:42.017 --> 00:04:46.303
Former Eastern Bloc countries
and sub-Saharan African countries

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:49.863
rank higher than us
as far as quality and value.

00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:55.023
Something I experience
every day in my practice,

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:59.100
and I'm sure, something many of you
on your own journeys have experienced:

00:04:59.927 --> 00:05:02.807
more is not more.

00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:06.185
Those individuals who had more tests,

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:07.479
more bells, more whistles,

00:05:07.503 --> 00:05:09.931
more chemotherapy,
more surgery, more whatever --

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:12.404
the more that we do to someone,

00:05:13.283 --> 00:05:15.880
it decreases the quality of their life.

00:05:17.422 --> 00:05:19.693
And it shortens it, most often.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.721
So what are we going to do about this?

00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.148
What are we doing about this?

00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.073
And why is this so?

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:29.001
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:32.423
is that we, the health care industry --
long white-coat physicians --

00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:33.857
are stealing from you.

00:05:34.877 --> 00:05:37.068
Stealing from you the opportunity

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:40.334
to choose how you want to live your lives

00:05:40.358 --> 00:05:42.839
in the context of whatever disease it is.

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:45.632
We focus on disease
and pathology and surgery

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:47.037
and pharmacology.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.395
We miss the human being.

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:54.961
How can we treat this

00:05:54.985 --> 00:05:56.778
without understanding this?

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.968
We do things to this;

00:06:02.948 --> 00:06:06.425
we need to do things for this.

00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:09.941
The triple aim of healthcare:

00:06:09.965 --> 00:06:13.057
one, improve patient experience.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:16.275
Two, improve the population health.

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:22.250
Three, decrease per capita expenditure
across a continuum.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.334
Our group, palliative care,

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:29.375
in 2012, working with
the sickest of the sick --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.151
cancer,

00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:33.520
heart disease, lung disease,

00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:35.168
renal disease,

00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:36.389
dementia --

00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:39.839
how did we improve patient experience?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.609
"I want to be at home, Doc."

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:44.844
"OK, we'll bring the care to you."

00:06:44.868 --> 00:06:46.680
Quality of life, enhanced.

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:49.090
Think about the human being.

00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:51.045
Two: population health.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.920
How did we look
at this population differently,

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:56.792
and engage with them
at a different level, a deeper level,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:00.017
and connect to a broader sense
of the human condition than my own?

00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.675
How do we manage this group,

00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:06.353
so that of our outpatient population,

00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:11.275
94 percent, in 2012,
never had to go to the hospital?

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.552
Not because they couldn't.

00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:16.998
But they didn't have to.

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:18.751
We brought the care to them.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.385
We maintained their value, their quality.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.227
Number three: per capita expenditures.

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:30.144
For this population,

00:07:30.168 --> 00:07:35.221
that today is 2.3 trillion dollars
and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,

00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:39.979
we reduced health care expenditures
by nearly 70 percent.

00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:44.322
They got more of what they wanted
based on their values,

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:46.405
lived better and are living longer,

00:07:47.464 --> 00:07:49.233
for two-thirds less money.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.915
While Harold's time was limited,

00:07:57.663 --> 00:07:59.564
palliative care's is not.

00:08:00.288 --> 00:08:04.964
Palliative care is a paradigm
from diagnosis through the end of life.

00:08:06.677 --> 00:08:07.854
The hours,

00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:10.753
weeks, months, years,

00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:13.074
across a continuum --

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:14.982
with treatment, without treatment.

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:16.362
Meet Christine.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.127
Stage III cervical cancer,

00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:22.172
so, metastatic cancer
that started in her cervix,

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.679
spread throughout her body.

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:27.362
She's in her 50s and she is living.

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.336
This is not about end of life,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.875
this is about life.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.070
This is not just about the elderly,

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.756
this is about people.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.141
This is Richard.

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:41.347
End-stage lung disease.

00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:44.853
"Richard, what is it
that you hold sacred?"

00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:48.596
"My kids, my wife and my Harley."

00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:50.105
(Laughter)

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.279
"Alright!

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:55.782
I can't drive you around on it
because I can barely pedal a bicycle,

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.297
but let's see what we can do."

00:08:58.385 --> 00:09:00.922
Richard came to me,

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:03.843
and he was in rough shape.

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.225
He had this little voice telling him

00:09:06.249 --> 00:09:08.650
that maybe his time was weeks to months.

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:10.754
And then we just talked.

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:14.867
And I listened and tried to hear --

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.178
big difference.

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:18.371
Use these in proportion to this.

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:23.004
I said, "Alright, let's take it
one day at a time,"

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:25.555
like we do in every
other chapter of our life.

00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:30.982
And we have met Richard
where Richard's at day-to-day.

00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:34.028
And it's a phone call or two a week,

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:39.222
but he's thriving in the context
of end-stage lung disease.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.533
Now, palliative medicine is not
just for the elderly,

00:09:45.557 --> 00:09:48.161
it is not just for the middle-aged.

00:09:49.535 --> 00:09:51.066
It is for everyone.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.629
Meet my friend Jonathan.

00:09:53.903 --> 00:09:55.383
We have the honor and pleasure

00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:57.727
of Jonathan and his father
joining us here today.

00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:00.583
Jonathan is in his 20s,
and I met him several years ago.

00:10:00.607 --> 00:10:03.929
He was dealing with
metastatic testicular cancer,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.952
spread to his brain.

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:07.647
He had a stroke,

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.923
he had brain surgery,

00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:11.959
radiation, chemotherapy.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.375
Upon meeting him and his family,

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.230
he was a couple of weeks away
from a bone marrow transplant,

00:10:18.254 --> 00:10:20.515
and in listening and engaging,

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:25.585
they said, "Help us
understand -- what is cancer?"

00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:29.417
How did we get this far

00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:32.814
without understanding
what we're dealing with?

00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:35.690
How did we get this far
without empowering somebody

00:10:35.714 --> 00:10:37.626
to know what it is they're dealing with,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.258
and then taking the next step and engaging
in who they are as human beings

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:43.378
to know if that is what we should do?

00:10:43.402 --> 00:10:46.481
Lord knows we can do
any kind of thing to you.

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.338
But should we?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.554
And don't take my word for it.

00:10:55.578 --> 00:11:00.030
All the evidence that is related
to palliative care these days

00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:04.175
demonstrates with absolute certainty
people live better and live longer.

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:07.543
There was a seminal article
out of the New England Journal of Medicine

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:08.717
in 2010.

00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:12.285
A study done at Harvard
by friends of mine, colleagues.

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:13.690
End-stage lung cancer:

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.832
one group with palliative care,

00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:18.377
a similar group without.

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:23.134
The group with palliative care
reported less pain,

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.118
less depression.

00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:28.463
They needed fewer hospitalizations.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.894
And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:34.282
they lived three to six months longer.

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:39.246
If palliative care were a cancer drug,

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:43.284
every cancer doctor on the planet
would write a prescription for it.

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:46.059
Why don't they?

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.914
Again, because we goofy,
long white-coat physicians

00:11:50.938 --> 00:11:54.984
are trained and of the mantra
of dealing with this,

00:11:56.401 --> 00:11:57.635
not with this.

00:12:02.697 --> 00:12:06.441
This is a space that we will
all come to at some point.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:10.433
But this conversation today
is not about dying,

00:12:10.457 --> 00:12:11.830
it is about living.

00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:13.613
Living based on our values,

00:12:13.637 --> 00:12:15.056
what we find sacred

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.497
and how we want to write
the chapters of our lives,

00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:19.355
whether it's the last

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:20.776
or the last five.

00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:23.672
What we know,

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:25.664
what we have proven,

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:29.012
is that this conversation
needs to happen today --

00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:32.005
not next week, not next year.

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.859
What is at stake is our lives today

00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:36.683
and the lives of us as we get older

00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:39.247
and the lives of our children
and our grandchildren.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.183
Not just in that hospital room

00:12:42.207 --> 00:12:44.117
or on the couch at home,

00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.529
but everywhere we go
and everything we see.

00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:53.546
Palliative medicine is the answer
to engage with human beings,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.024
to change the journey
that we will all face,

00:12:58.304 --> 00:12:59.804
and change it for the better.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.555
To my colleagues,

00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:06.087
to my patients,

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:07.876
to my government,

00:13:08.303 --> 00:13:10.362
to all human beings,

00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:13.756
I ask that we stand and we
shout and we demand

00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:16.232
the best care possible,

00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:19.582
so that we can live better today

00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:21.287
and ensure a better life tomorrow.

00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:23.278
We need to shift today

00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:27.333
so that we can live tomorrow.

00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:29.989
Thank you very much.

00:13:30.013 --> 00:13:31.301
(Applause)
