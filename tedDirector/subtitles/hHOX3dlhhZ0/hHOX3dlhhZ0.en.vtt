00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.656
For over a decade,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.736
I have studied young people
that have been pushed out of school,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680
so called "dropouts."

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.776
As they end up failed
by the education system,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.336
they're on the streets
where they're vulnerable to violence,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.816
police harassment,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.296
police brutality

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.960
and incarceration.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.776
I follow these young people
for years at a time,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.216
across institutional settings,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.400
to try to understand what some of us call
the "school-to-prison pipeline."

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.696
When you look at a picture like this,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.280
of young people who are in my study ...

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.856
you might see trouble.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.056
I mean one of the boys
has a bottle of liquor in his hand,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.216
he's 14 years old

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.760
and it's a school day.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.936
Other people, when they see this picture,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.976
might see gangs,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.096
thugs, delinquents --

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.320
criminals.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320
But I see it different.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.496
I see these young people
through a perspective

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
that looks at the assets
that they bring to the education system.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.336
So will you join me in changing
the way we label young people

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.000
from "at-risk" to "at-promise?"

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.520
(Applause)

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.616
How do I know that these young people

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.096
have the potential
and the promise to change?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.160
I know this because I am one of them.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.016
You see, I grew up
in dire poverty in the inner city,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.256
without a father --

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.360
he abandoned me before I was even born.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.096
We were on welfare,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.416
sometimes homeless,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.920
many times hungry.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.016
By the time I was 15 years old,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.320
I had been incarcerated in juvy
three times for three felonies.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.480
My best friend had already been killed.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.256
And soon after,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.816
while I'm standing next to my uncle,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.039
he gets shot.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.056
And as I'm waiting
for the ambulance to arrive

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.840
for over an hour ...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.680
he bleeds to death on the street.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.400
I had lost faith and hope in the world,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.496
and I had given up on the system
because the system had failed me.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.616
I had nothing to offer

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200
and no one had anything to offer me.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.736
I was fatalistic.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.760
I didn't even think
I could make it to my 18th birthday.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.656
The reason I'm here today

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.176
is because a teacher
that cared reached out

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.840
and managed to tap into my soul.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.376
This teacher,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.600
Ms. Russ ...

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.216
she was the kind of teacher
that was always in your business.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.976
(Laughter)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.456
She was the kind of teacher that was like,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.616
"Victor, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.840
(Laughter)

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.536
I wasn't ready.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.200
But she understood one basic principle
about young people like me.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.120
We're like oysters.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.496
We're only going to open up
when we're ready,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.000
and if you're not there when we're ready,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.294
we're going to clam back up.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.096
Ms. Russ was there for me.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.136
She was culturally relevant,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.296
she respected my community,
my people, my family.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.640
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.896
He would take me to work with him
because I was broke,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.776
and he knew I needed some money.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.480
He collected glass bottles for a living.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.376
Four in the morning on a school day,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.000
we'd throw the glass bottles
in the back of his van,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.120
and the bottles would break.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.816
And my hands and arms would start to bleed

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.520
and my tennis shoes and pants
would get all bloody.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.400
And I was terrified and in pain,
and I would stop working.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.176
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes
and he would say to me,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.536
"Mijo,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.240
estamos buscando vida."

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.576
"We're searching for a better life,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600
we're trying to make
something out of nothing."

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.696
Ms. Russ listened to my story,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.216
welcomed it into the classroom and said,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.280
"Victor, this is your power.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.240
This is your potential.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.136
Your family, your culture, your community
have taught you a hard-work ethic

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.496
and you will use it to empower
yourself in the academic world

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.240
so you can come back
and empower your community."

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.416
With Ms. Russ's help,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.320
I ended up returning to school.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.040
I even finished my credits on time

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.720
and graduated with my class.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.200
(Applause)

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.416
But Ms. Russ said to me
right before graduation,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.760
"Victor, I'm so proud of you.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.696
I knew you could do it.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.936
Now it's time to go to college."

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.160
(Laughter)

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.536
College, me?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.600
Man, what is this teacher smoking
thinking I'm going to college?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.120
I applied with the mentors
and support she provided,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.016
got a letter of acceptance,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.256
and one of the paragraphs read,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.640
"You've been admitted
under probationary status."

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.896
I said, "Probation?
I'm already on probation,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.136
that don't matter?"

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.416
(Laughter)

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.320
It was academic probation,
not criminal probation.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.136
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ
do to succeed with young people

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.056
like the ones I study?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.256
I propose three strategies.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.496
The first:

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.696
let's get rid of our
deficit perspective in education.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.976
"These people
come from a culture of violence,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.256
a culture of poverty.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.856
These people are at-risk;
these people are truant.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.760
These people are empty containers
for us to fill with knowledge.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.696
They have the problems,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.800
we have the solutions."

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.400
Number two.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.760
Let's value the stories that young people
bring to the schoolhouse.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.056
Their stories of overcoming
insurmountable odds are so powerful.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.760
And I know you know some of these stories.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.096
These very same stories and experiences

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.760
already have grit, character
and resilience in them.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.816
So let's help young people
refine those stories.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.816
Let's help them be proud of who they are,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.776
because our education system
welcomes their families, their cultures,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.016
their communities

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.840
and the skill set
they've learned to survive.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.816
And of course the third strategy
being the most important:

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.056
resources.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.920
We have to provide
adequate resources to young people.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.800
Grit alone isn't going to cut it.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.256
You can sit there
and tell me all you want,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.416
"Hey man, pick yourself up
by the bootstraps."

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.496
But if I was born
without any straps on my boots --

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.736
(Laughter)

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.496
How am I supposed to pick myself up?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.360
(Applause)

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.736
Job training,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.976
mentoring,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.696
counseling ...

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.456
Teaching young people
to learn from their mistakes

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.176
instead of criminalizing them,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.720
and dragging them out
of their classrooms like animals.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.616
How about this?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.376
I propose that we implement restorative
justice in every high school in America.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.080
(Applause)

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.056
So we went out to test these ideas
in the community of Watts in LA

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.336
with 40 young people
that had been pushed out of school.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.040
William was one of them.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.896
William was the kind of kid
that had been given every label.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.136
He had dropped out, he was a gang member,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.400
a criminal.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.776
And when we met him he was very resistant.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.216
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.536
"Hey, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.015
(Laughter)

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.320
So over time --

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.696
over time he began to open up.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.159
And I remember the day
that he made the switch.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.616
We were in a large group

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.736
and a young lady in our program was crying

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.440
because she told us her powerful story

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.696
of her dad being killed

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.720
and then his body being shown
in the newspaper the next day.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.176
And as she's crying,
I don't know what to do,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.936
so I give her her space,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.200
and William had enough.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.616
He slammed his hands
on the desk and he said,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.120
"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.280
(Applause)

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.176
This young lady's tears and pain
turned into joy and laughter

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.776
knowing that her community had her back,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.576
and William had now learned
that he did have a purpose in life:

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.560
to help to heal the souls
of people in his own community.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.176
He told us his story.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.976
We refined his story

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.816
to go from being the story of a victim
to being the story of a survivor

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.216
that has overcome adversity.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.160
We placed high value on it.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.160
William went on to finish high school,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.096
get his security guard certificate
to become a security guard,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.976
and is now working
at a local school district.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.920
(Applause)

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.336
Ms. Russ's mantra --

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.616
her mantra was always,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.040
"when you teach to the heart,
the mind will follow."

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.520
The great writer Khalil Gibran says,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.640
"Out of suffering
have emerged the greatest souls.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.360
The massive characters
are seared with scars."

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.696
I believe that in this education
revolution that we're talking about

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.656
we need to invite the souls
of the young people that we work with,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.936
and once they're able to refine --

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.016
identify their grit,
resilience and character

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.880
that they've already developed --

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.120
their academic performance will improve.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.696
Let's believe in young people.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.016
Let's provide them
the right kinds of resources.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.696
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.200
She believed in me so much

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.216
that she tricked me
into believing in myself.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.456
Thank you.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.040
(Applause)
