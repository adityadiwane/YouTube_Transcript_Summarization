00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is to choose a light-hearted theme.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Last time, I talked about death and dying.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But it has to be technological,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so I'll talk about electroshock therapy. (Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You know, ever since man had any notion

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that some of his other people, his colleagues,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or what we now recognize as schizophrenia,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
he was certain that this kind of illness

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
had to come from evil spirits getting into the body.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, the way of treating these diseases

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in early times was to, in some way or other,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
exorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But it wasn't enough to use the priests.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with Hippocrates and those boys,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
they tried to look for herbs, plants

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that would literally shake the bad spirits out.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And the herbals, the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Finally, in about the sixteenth century,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter) -- good, old Paracelsus

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
found that he could predict the degree of convulsion

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Can you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball, and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
chewing on it if you're feeling depressed?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So what we see in the seventeenth, eighteenth century

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and he comes close to convulsing himself

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then, we fast-forward to about 1932,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
when three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Not only would it lift, but it might never return.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So they got very interested in producing convulsions,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
measured types of convulsions.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So, they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, they went to the police and they said,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
"We know that at the Rome railroad station,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there are all these lost souls wandering around,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?"

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Someone who is, as the Italians say, "cagoots."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So they found this "cagoots" guy,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
who was known, had been known for months,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to be literally defecating on himself,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
talking nothing that made any sense,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and they brought him into the hospital.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So these three psychiatrists, after about two or three weeks of observation,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
laid him down on a table,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
connected his temples to a very small source of current.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
That's not going to do anything terrible to him."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So they did that.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
who told me this about 35 years ago,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
when I was thinking about these things

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for some research project of mine.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He said, "This fellow" -- remember, he wasn't even put to sleep --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"after this major grand mal convulsion,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
sat right up, looked at these three fellas and said,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?' "

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Laughter)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
If I could only say that in Italian.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Well, they were happy as could be, because he

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So they plugged him in again,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and this time they used 110 volts for half a second.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And to their amazement, after it was over,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
he began speaking like he was perfectly well.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
He relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and he was essentially cured.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But of course, having schizophrenia,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
within a few months, it returned.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But they wrote a paper about this,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and everybody in the Western world began using electricity

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in the treatment of depression.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and it became very, very popular.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They would anesthetize people,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
convulse them, but the real difficulty was

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that there was no way to paralyze muscles.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So people would have a real grand mal seizure.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Bones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
you couldn't use it.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
were developed by pharmacologists,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Well, you know, in the middle '60s,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and they were very effective.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
about the kinds of things that they would witness.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And the reason that it has had a renaissance

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
do not respond, regardless of what is done for them.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Now, why am I telling you this story at this meeting?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I'm telling you this story, because actually ever since

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Richard called me and asked me to talk about

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
-- as he asked all of his speakers --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to talk about something that would be new to this audience,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that we had never talked about, never written about,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I've been planning this moment.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And let me tell you this story.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I was, in the 1960s, in a marriage. To use the word bad

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
would be perhaps the understatement of the year.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
It was dreadful.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
There are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
to know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
a very difficult adolescence --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
it had to do with not quite poverty but close.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
no one could read or write English.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I was a little prone to depression.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
trying to save this marriage,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
which was inevitably not to be saved.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Finally, I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I couldn't even pull the covers off myself.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well, you're in a university medical center,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
where everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
so my referrals began to decrease.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
As my referrals began to decrease,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I clearly became increasingly depressed

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
until I thought, my God, I can't work anymore.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And, in fact, it didn't make any difference

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because I didn't have any patients anymore.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So, with the advice of my physician,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And my colleagues, who had known me since medical school

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in that place, said, "Don't worry, chap. Six weeks,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Well, you know what bovine stercus is?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
(Laughter)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So I was one of their failures.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it was clear -- not to me,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that I would need long-term hospitalization

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in that awful place called a mental hospital.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It was founded in the eighteenth century,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Connecticut, other than the huge public hospitals

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that existed at that time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And they tried everything they had.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
They tried the usual psychotherapy.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They tried every medication available in those days.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And they did have Tofranil and other things -- Mellaril, who knows what.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
All the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They put all their heads together and they decided

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that there was nothing that could be done

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
who by that time had become so overwhelmed,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
not just with depression and feelings

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of worthlessness and inadequacy,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
but with obsessional thinking,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
obsessional thinking about coincidences.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
just got me dreadfully upset -- all kinds of ritualistic observances,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
just awful, awful stuff.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Remember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The Scream. Every moment was a scream.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
there was no treatment. But there was one treatment,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940s,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and you can imagine what it was. It was pre-frontal lobotomy.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So they decided -- I didn't know this, again,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I found this out later --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that the only thing that could be done was

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
for this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
lobotomy.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Well, as in all hospitals, there was a resident

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
assigned to my case. He was 27 years old,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and he would meet with me two or three times a week.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
because he was very well thought of in that place.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They thought he had a really extraordinary future.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And he dug in his heels and said,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
"No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Any of the results along the spectrum,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
from pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
is going to happen. If he does the best he can,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
he will have no further obsessions,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
probably no depression, but his affect will be dulled,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
he will never go back to surgery,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
his life will be changed. If he has the usual result,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life."

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Well, he said, "Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?"

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
They just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference."

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So they gave the course of 10,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and the first -- the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and still is six to eight.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Plugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Eight didn't work. At nine, I noticed --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and it's wonderful that I could notice anything

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
-- I noticed a change. And at 10, I noticed a real change.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Again, not a single one of them

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
-- I think there are about seven or eight of them --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that I could overcome this,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that I was now strong enough that by an act of will,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I could blow the obsessional thinking away.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I could blow the depression away.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And I've never forgotten -- I never will forget

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
-- standing in the kitchen of the unit,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
it was a Sunday morning in January of 1974,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking, "I've got the strength now to do this."

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and I could think clearly.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
when I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
will remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and they will remember that she was married

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And she used to go nuts, every five minutes or so in the play,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and he said to her, "We must have a word to bring you back to reality,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'"

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So every time she got a little nuts,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
he would say, "Basingstoke!" And she would say,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
"Basingstoke, it is." And she would be fine for a little while.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke."

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But I had something better. And it was very simple.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It was, "Ah, fuck it!"

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
(Laughter) Much better than "Basingstoke,"

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
at least for me. And it worked -- my God, it worked.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
again, once more, after 20 shock treatments

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
-- I would say, "Ah, fuck it."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And things got better and better,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and within three or four months,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
where I could work with other people in the community,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
not in New Haven, but fairly close by.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I stayed there for three years.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
At the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
had remarried by that time.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
My children came back to live with us.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We had two more children after that.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Resuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Went right back into the university

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and began to write books.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I stopped doing surgery about six years ago

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
and became a full-time writer, as many people know.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Every once in a while, I have to say, "Ah, fuck it."

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Every once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So, I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Why have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, those of you who know some of these books

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
know that one is about death and dying,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
one is about the human body and the human spirit,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
and they have always to do with my own personal experiences.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
One might think reading these books

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
-- and I've gotten thousands of letters about them

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
by people who do think this --

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
my early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
That I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I really have it figured out, so that I can advise people about

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
death and dying, so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And I've always felt guilty about that.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
because my readers don't know what I have just told you.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
It's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
but it is not generally known.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
is to -- frankly, selfishly --

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
unburden myself and let it be known

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
But more importantly, I think,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
is the fact that a very significant proportion

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
of people in this audience are under 30,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and there are many, of course, who are well over 30.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
For people under 30, and it looks to me like almost all of you

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
-- I would say all of you --

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
or right into a magnificent and exciting career:

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
anything can happen to you. Things change.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
You can be thrown off the track.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I hope it happens to none of you,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
To those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
If I, with the bleakness of spirit,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
with no spirit, that I had in the 1970s

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and no possibility of recovery,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
if I can find my way back from this,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
believe me, anybody can find their way back

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
from any adversity that exists in their lives.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And for those who are older, who have lived through

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
perhaps not something as bad as this,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
but who have lived through difficult times,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
perhaps where they lost everything, as I did,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
and started out all over again, some of these things will seem very familiar.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
There is recovery.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000
There is redemption. And there is resurrection.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and it is because not just only do we fantasize

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
about the possibility of resurrection and recovery,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
but it actually happens. And it happens a lot.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
outside of specifically religious ones,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
is the one about the phoenix, the ancient story of the phoenix,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000
who, every 500 years, resurrects itself from its own ashes

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
to go on to live a life that is

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
even more beautiful than it was before. Richard,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
thanks very much.
