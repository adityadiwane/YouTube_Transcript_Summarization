00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm an American, which means, generally,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I ignore football unless it involves

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
guys my size or Bruno's size

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
running into each other at extremely high speeds.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
That said, it's been really hard

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
to ignore football

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
for the last couple of weeks.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
FIFA, vuvuzela,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
weird jokes about octopi.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that I haven't been able to figure out,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
you've probably seen this.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
It's been a major trending topic.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
So I went onto Twitter,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
were more than ready to help.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
They explained that the Galvao bird

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
is a rare and endangered parrot

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
that's in terrible, terrible danger.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
native to Brazil.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
are killed during Carnival parades.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and it actually gets worse.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
very attractive, useful for headdresses,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
which means that there's a terrible problem

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
with Galvao abuse.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And it's terribly endangered.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
The good news about this is that the global community --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
is pitching in to help out.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
It turns out that Lady Gaga

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
has released a new single --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
titled "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And my Brazilian friends tell me that

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
10 cents will be given

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
to a global campaign

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
to save this rare and beautiful bird.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and actually a very, very good one.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
who's the lead soccer commentator

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
for Rede Globo.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is that this guy is just a cliche machine.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
He can ruin the most interesting match

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
by just spouting cliche again and again and again.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So Brazilians went to that first match

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
against North Korea,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and tried to convince the rest of us

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And in fact, were so successful at this

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that it topped Twitter for two weeks.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Now there's a couple --

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
is that you cannot go wrong

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
asking people to be active online,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So as long as activism is that simple,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
it's pretty easy to get away with.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
The other thing you can take from this, by the way,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
There's more than five million of them.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
As far as national representation,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Next to Japan,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
it's the second most represented by population.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and you didn't realize

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
you're like most of us.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Because what happens on a social network

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is you interact with the people

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that you have chosen to interact with.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And you don't necessarily have the sense

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
a heavily African-American space.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Twitter recently did some research.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
They looked at their local population.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
They believe that 24 percent

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
of American Twitter users are African-American.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
That's about twice as high as African-Americans

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
are represented in the population.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
but it shouldn't be.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
you can go into Trending Topics.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And you tend to find topics

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
that are almost entirely African-American conversations.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and Martin Wattenberg,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
two amazing visualization designers,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
who looked at

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
were basically segregated conversations --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and in ways that you wouldn't expect.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that cookout

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is a mostly black conversation.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And what's crazy about this is that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
it's literally a quick click away.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
with different people participating in it.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But generally speaking, most of us don't.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
We end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
where we see the people we already know

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and the people who are similar to the people we already know.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And we tend not to see that wider picture.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Now for me, I'm surprised by this,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
If you go back into the early days of the internet,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
were writing big books like "Being Digital,"

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the prediction was that the internet

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
was going to be an incredibly powerful force

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to smooth out cultural differences,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Negroponte started his book with a story

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
about how hard it is to build connections

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
in the world of atoms.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
He's at a technology conference in Florida.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
which is bottles of Evian water on the table.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And Negroponte says this is crazy.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
This is the old economy.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
It's the economy of moving these

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
We're heading to the future of bits,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
where everything is speedy, it's weightless.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And it's going to change the world as we know it.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
He's totally wrong about this one.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
It turns out that in many cases

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
atoms are much more mobile than bits.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
If I walk into a store in the United States,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
it's very, very easy for me to buy water

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
that's bottled in Fiji,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
shipped at great expense to the United States.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It's actually surprisingly hard

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
for me to see a Fijian feature film.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
There's a coup government. There's a military government.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
There's crackdowns on the press.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
It's actually a place that we probably should

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
be paying attention to at the moment.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Here's what I think is going on.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I think that we tend to look a lot

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
at the infrastructure

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
of globalization.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
We look at the framework that makes it possible

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to live in this connected world.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
It includes things like the Internet cables.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We look at a map like this one,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and it looks like the entire world is flat

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
because everything is a hop or two away.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
You can get on a flight in London,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
you can end up in Bangalore later today.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
It's all right there.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
When you start looking at what actually

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
flows on top of these networks,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
you get a very different picture.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
You start looking at how

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
the global plane flights move,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
It's extremely lumpy.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
There's basically a giant pathway in the sky

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
between London and New York.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
but look at this map, and you can watch this

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
for, you know, two or three minutes.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
You won't see very many planes

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
go from South America to Africa.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that are systematically cut off.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and we look at what actually happens,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
that we think it does.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
So here's the problem that I've been interested in

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
in the last decade or so.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
The world is, in fact, getting more global.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
It's getting more connected.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
More of problems are global in scale.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
More of our economics is global in scale.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And our media is less global by the day.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
on a nightly new broadcast.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Alisa's the president of Public Radio International.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
based on what American

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
television news casts

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
looked at for a month.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
the world within American television news

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
is basically reduced to

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
this giant bloated U.S.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And that's basically what our media is about.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and I get the same thing.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and the nations we've invaded.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
It turns out that new media

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
isn't necessarily helping us all that much.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Here's a map made by Mark Graham

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that have been geo-coded.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
towards North America and Western Europe.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Even within Wikipedias,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
where we're creating their own content online,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
there's a heavy bias towards the place where

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
rather than to the rest of the world.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
In the U.K., you can get up,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
You probably won't.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
If you look at online media consumption --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
more than 95 percent of the news readership

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
is on domestic news sites.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
because we actually like reading your media,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
rather than vice versa.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
So all of this starts leading me

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
to think that we're in a state that I refer to

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
as imaginary cosmopolitanism.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
We look at the internet.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
to connect us to the rest of the world.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And we forget that most of the time

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
So this is a real problem --

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but it's a real problem because,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
as we're discussing here at TED,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
the real problems in the world

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
the interesting problems to solve

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
are global in scale and scope,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
they require global conversations

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
to get to global solutions.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This is a problem we have to solve.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
So here's the good news.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
This is a group called Global Voices.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Our mission was to fix the world's media.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
We started in 2004.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Nor do I think we are by ourselves,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
actually going to solve the problem.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
But the more that I think about it, the more that I think

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that a few things that we have learned along the way

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
are interesting lessons for how we would rewire

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The first thing you have to consider

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
is that there are parts of the world

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that are dark spots in terms of attention.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
they're dark literally because of lack of electricity.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
basically meant you're not going to get media from there

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
because there are more basic needs.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
What I'm starting to realize is that

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and you need an enormous amount of encouragement.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
One of those dark spots is Madagascar,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
than it is actually known for

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
the lovely people who live there.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And so the people who founded

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Foko Club in Madagascar

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
They were doing something much simpler.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
It was a club to learn English

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and to learn computers and the internet.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
but what happened was that Madagascar

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
went through a violent coup.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Most independent media was shut down.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And the high school students

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
who were learning to blog through Foko Club

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
about the demonstrations, the violence,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
everything that was going on within this country.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
So a very, very small program

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
designed to get people in front of computers,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
ended up having a huge impact

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
on what we know about this country.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
most people here don't speak Malagasy.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese --

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
which is sort of sad if you think about it,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
as it's now the most represented language on the internet.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
you notice this really cute box at the top,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and very quickly at a mouse click

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
will give you a translation of the page.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
And the results can be pretty funny.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
What you really want -- what I really want,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
is eventually the ability to push a button

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
and have this queued

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
so a human being can translate this.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And if you think this is absurd, it's not.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And Yeeyan is a group

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
of 150,000 volunteers

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
who get online every day.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
They translate roughly 100 articles a day

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
from major newspapers, major websites.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
They put it online for free.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and who couldn't believe how biased

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
American media coverage was.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
so that people between these countries

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
start understanding each other a little bit better."

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And my question to you is:

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
to translate the English internet into Chinese,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
where's the English language Yeeyan?

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Who's going after Chinese,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
which now has 400 million internet users out there?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
there's no guarantee that we're going to find it.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
When we look for information online,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
we basically have two strategies.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
We use a lot of search.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
But if what you're looking for is serendipity,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
if you want to stumble onto something

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
that you didn't know you needed,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
to look for our friends.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
The problem with this is that essentially

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
You end up flocking with a lot of people

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
who are probably similar to you,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
who have similar interests.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And it's very, very hard to get information

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
where people getting together and talking about their own interests.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
To do this, at a certain point,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
You need a guide.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
from killing each other,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
she has to figure out

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
what is going to interest you

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
about the Middle East.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
And in that sense of trying to get you

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
out of your normal orbit,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and to try to get you to pay attention

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
to a story about someone who's

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
given up smoking for the month of Ramadan,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
she has to know something about a global audience.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
She has to know something about what stories are available.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Basically, she's a deejay.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
She's a skilled human curator

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
who knows what material is available to her,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
who's able to listen to the audience,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and who's able to make a selection

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and push people forward in one fashion or another.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
I think what's great about the internet

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
is that it actually makes it much easier

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
for deejays to reach a wider audience.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
I know Amira.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
I can ask her what to read.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
tell a lot of people what to read.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
And you can listen to her as well,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
So once you start widening like this,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
once you start translating, once you start curating,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
you end up in some really weird places.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
which is AfriGadget.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
at technology in an Africa context.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
in Kibera in Nairobi,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
who is turning the shaft of a Landrover

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
into a cold chisel.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
"Why would I conceivably care about this?"

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
He goes by the moniker White African.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
He's both a very well known American geek,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
He is a bridge figure.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds --

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
one in the world of the African technology community,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
one in the world of the American technology community.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
And so he's able to tell a story

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
about this blacksmith in Kibera

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and turn it into a story about repurposing technology,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
about innovating from constraint,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
He knows one world,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
both of which he has deep connections to.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
are the future of how we try to make the world wider

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
through using the web.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
But the trick with bridges is, ultimately,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
you need someone to cross them.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
So if I found myself in the NFL,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
I suspect I would spend my off-season

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth --

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
possibly recording a hip-hop album.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
Dhani Jones,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
has a slightly different approach to the off-season.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
Dhani has a television show.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
And every week on this television show,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
Dhani travels to a different nation of the world.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
He finds a local sporting team.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
And his reason for this

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
It's because, for him,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
sport is the language

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
that allows him to encounter

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
the full width and wonder of the world.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
But there are all these different techniques

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
that allow you to go out and look at the world

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
and find your place within it.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
The goal of my Talk here

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
is not to persuade the people in this room

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
to embrace your xenophilia.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal --

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
is that most of you are xenophiles,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
whether or not you use that term.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
My challenge instead is this.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
It's not enough to make the personal decision

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
that you want a wider world.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
We have to figure out how to rewire

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
the systems that we have.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
We have to fix our media.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
We have to fix our immigration policy.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
We need to look at ways

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
of creating serendipity,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
of making translation pervasive,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
and we need to find ways to embrace

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
and celebrate these bridge figures.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.260
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.260
(Applause)
