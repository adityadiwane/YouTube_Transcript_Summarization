00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
So, about three years ago I was in London,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
I represent a group of people,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
We want to be in the forefront fields,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
and we want to do it differently.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
We want to get out of this thing

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and decide what science gets done.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
(Laughter)

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
is take you on a quick tour of some of the things

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
that we talk about and we think about.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
So, we think a lot about what really makes science work?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
The first thing that anybody who knows science,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and has been around science,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
is wrong. There is no method.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
as a community, from incomplete evidence

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
to conclusions that we all agree about.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
So how does it work?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Well, my belief is that it works

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And here are some of the ethical principles.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
I’m in entertain, amaze mode.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
(Laughter)

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
But one of the principles is that everybody

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
who is part of the community gets to fight and argue

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
as hard as they can for what they believe.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
that the only people who are going to decide, you know,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
whether I’m right or somebody else is right,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
are the people in our community in the next generation,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
in 30 and 50 years.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
So it’s this combination of respect

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
for the tradition and community we’re in,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
that makes science work.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.160
And being in this process of being in a community

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
I believe, teaches us about democracy.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
but there has been, historically, a relationship

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.160
between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
and how people think about the society that they live in.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
goes to its natural place, which was of course,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.160
the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
embraced Aristotle and blessed it.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And the idea is that everything is defined.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
perfect realm, where lives God,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
who is the ultimate judge of everything.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
and in a certain sense, medieval society.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
space and time and motion and so forth of Newton.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
of John Locke and his collaborators.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
And they were very closely associated.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and a society on the other hand, were closely related.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And let me show you.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
There are particles and they move around

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.160
with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
but with respect to this absolute notion of space,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
which for Newton was God.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
and those are defined with respect to some absolute,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.160
which are independent of what else has happened in the society.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
There is also an omniscient observer

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
who knows everything, who is God,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
who is in a certain sense outside the universe,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
because he has no role in anything that happens,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
but is in a certain sense everywhere,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
because space is just the way that God knows

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160
where everything is, according to Newton, OK?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
liberal political theory and Newtonian physics.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
and which is still going on.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160
It was begun with the invention

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
of relativity theory and quantum theory.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160
of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
something that’s going on right now.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.160
And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160
This universe is described by being a network of relationships.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
absolutely where something is.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
So we call it a relational universe.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.160
your view of the world has to do with what information

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
comes to you through the network of relations.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And there’s no place for an omniscient observer

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
This is also, if you talk to legal scholars,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160
They’re thinking about the same things.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
And not only that, they make the analogy

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
to relativity theory and cosmology often.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.160
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
which means that there’s no place

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
to put an explanation for something outside.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
So in such a relational universe,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
like this device here, or that device there,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
or something beautiful, like all the living things,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
all of you guys in the room --

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.160
"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
(Laughter)

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
Then you want to know, you’re a person,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
you want to know how is it made.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
There must be mechanisms of self-organization

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
inside the universe that make things.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160
that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
So it works. But not only that,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
if you think about how natural selection works,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
then it turns out that natural selection

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
would only make sense in such a relational universe.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
That is, natural selection works on properties,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
like fitness, which are about relationships

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
of some species to some other species.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.160
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
So a theory of biology based on natural selection

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
requires a relational notion of

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
what are the properties of biological systems.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
And if you push that all the way down, really,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
it makes the best sense in a relational universe

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
where all properties are relational.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.160
that gravity is the result of the world being relational.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.160
because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
In the 20th century,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.160
we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
In the biological sciences, they explored

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
the implications of the notion that order and complexity

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
and structure arise in a self-organized way.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.160
And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
the human sciences, economics, et cetera.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
At the same time, we physicists

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
have been busy trying to make sense of

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
and build on and integrate the discoveries

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
of quantum theory and relativity.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
21st-century science is going to be driven

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
by the integration of these two ideas:

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
the triumph of relational ways of thinking

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
about the world, on the one hand,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
on the other hand.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
And also, is that in the 21st century

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
our thinking about space and time and cosmology,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160
and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
And what they’re evolving towards is the union

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.160
Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.160
a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
that there are many different interests, many different agendas,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
many different individuals, many different points of view.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
in a network of relationships.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Any actor in a democracy is embedded

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160
in a network of relationships.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
And you understand some things better than other things,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
and because of that there’s a continual jostling

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160
and give and take, which is politics.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
And politics is, in the ideal sense,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
the way in which we continually address

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
our network of relations in order to achieve

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
a better life and a better society.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And I also think that science will never go away and --

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
I’m finishing on this line.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
(Laughter)

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.
