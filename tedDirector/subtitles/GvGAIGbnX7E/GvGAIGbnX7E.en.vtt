00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:19.308
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight.

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:21.592
Number one:

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:24.908
Teaching surgery and doing surgery

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:27.041
is really hard.

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:28.625
And second,

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.124
that language is one of the most profound things

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:34.442
that separate us all over the world.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.359
And in my little corner of the world,

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.309
these two things are actually related,

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.241
and I want to tell you how tonight.

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:44.247
Now, nobody wants an operation.

00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:48.186
Who here has had surgery?

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:49.509
Did you want it?

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:51.067
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.159
Nobody wants an operation.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.221
In particular, nobody wants an operation

00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:01.709
with tools like these through large incisions

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:03.684
that cause a lot of pain,

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:07.216
that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:09.467
that leave a big scar.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.369
But if you have to have an operation,

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.900
what you really want is a minimally invasive operation.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.932
That's what I want to talk to you about tonight --

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:19.666
how doing and teaching this type of surgery

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.133
led us on a search

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.667
for a better universal translator.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.010
Now, this type of surgery is hard,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.534
and it starts by putting people to sleep,

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:31.651
putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:33.467
blowing them up like a balloon,

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:38.656
sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen --

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:42.203
it's dangerous stuff --

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:46.846
and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:48.813
So let's see what it looks like.

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:50.579
So this is gallbladder surgery.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.611
We perform a million of these a year

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.829
in the United States alone.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.879
This is the real thing. There's no blood.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:00.013
And you can see how focused the surgeons are,

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:02.528
how much concentration it takes.

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:04.212
You can see it in their faces.

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:10.719
It's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.697
We do about five million of these in the United States

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:17.984
and maybe 20 million of these worldwide.

00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:20.817
All right, you've all heard the term:

00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:22.615
"He's a born surgeon."

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:26.015
Let me tell you, surgeons are not born.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.752
Surgeons are not made either.

00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:33.092
There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.

00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:37.547
Surgeons are trained one step at a time.

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:41.399
It starts with a foundation, basic skills.

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.164
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:47.932
where they learn to be an assistant.

00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:50.066
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.998
And when they do all of that for about five years,

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.364
they get the coveted board certification.

00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:58.998
If you need surgery, you want to be operated on

00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:01.482
by a board-certified surgeon.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:03.466
You get your board certificate,

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.809
and you can go out into practice.

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.076
And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:14.108
Now that foundation is so important

00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:16.009
that a number of us

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.576
from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:22.442
started in the late 1990s a training program

00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:26.793
that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:31.375
would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.060
necessary to go on and do procedures.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.159
Now the science behind this is so potent

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.943
that it became required by the American Board of Surgery

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:45.493
in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.

00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:49.278
It's not a lecture, it's not a course,

00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:52.676
it's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:54.910
It's hard.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.044
Now just this past year,

00:03:58.044 --> 00:04:01.110
one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.972
teamed up with us to make an announcement

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:06.442
that all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified

00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:09.526
before they do minimally invasive surgery.

00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:12.970
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.943
No, we just said all surgeons.

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:19.642
So to lift this education and training worldwide

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:20.892
is a very large task,

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:24.834
something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:29.526
SAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:33.565
So we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.798
We can't travel everywhere.

00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:38.616
We need to make the world a smaller place.

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:41.299
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so.

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:45.282
And one of the tools I like personally is using video.

00:04:45.282 --> 00:04:47.732
So I was inspired by a friend.

00:04:47.732 --> 00:04:49.981
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.

00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:52.586
And he proved

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:56.832
that you could actually teach people to do surgery

00:04:56.832 --> 00:04:59.532
using video conferencing.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:03.765
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:06.315
these basic fundamental skills

00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:09.032
necessary to do minimally invasive surgery.

00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:10.632
Very inspiring.

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:14.398
But for this examination, which is really hard,

00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:17.215
we have a problem.

00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:19.815
Even people who say they speak English,

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:22.332
only 14 percent pass.

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:24.348
Because for them it's not a surgery test,

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:28.223
it's an English test.

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:29.832
Let me bring it to you locally.

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:31.499
I work at the Cambridge Hospital.

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.782
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:40.098
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:45.282
and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.

00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.057
It's a big labor-intensive effort.

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:51.123
If you think about the worldwide burden

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:52.982
of trying to talk to your patients --

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:55.617
not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients --

00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:58.765
there aren't enough translators in the world.

00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:04.731
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.898
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors

00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:10.332
to people who just got here last week.

00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:12.617
And you have no idea how hard it is

00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:15.549
to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:18.449
And there isn't always a translator available.

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.812
So we need tools.

00:06:22.812 --> 00:06:26.490
We need a universal translator.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.899
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:36.416
is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.965
It's really about setting up a dialogue.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.816
We have a lot to learn.

00:06:40.816 --> 00:06:45.316
Here in the United States we spend more money per person

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:49.166
for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:52.549
Maybe we have something to learn as well.

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:57.032
So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.

00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:00.416
This past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,

00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:04.149
talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:07.681
And everywhere I go the barrier is:

00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:12.315
"We want this, but we need it in our language."

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.232
So here's what we think we want to do:

00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:17.649
Imagine giving a lecture

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:22.645
and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:28.333
I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:33.053
seamlessly, accurately

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:37.334
and in a cost-effective fashion using technology.

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:38.962
And it has to be bi-directional.

00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.749
They have to be able to teach us something as well.

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:43.149
It's a big task.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:46.215
So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:50.166
Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:55.366
but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.

00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:57.832
Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?

00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:01.931
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:04.416
I need to have a health care lexicon.

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:08.017
And in that I need a surgery lexicon.

00:08:08.017 --> 00:08:12.272
That's a tall order. We have to work at it.

00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:14.065
So let me show you what we're doing.

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:16.366
This is research -- can't buy it.

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:20.849
We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:25.782
to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.

00:08:25.782 --> 00:08:27.916
It starts with a framework system

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:30.648
where when the surgeon delivers the lecture

00:08:30.648 --> 00:08:33.815
using a framework of captioning technology,

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:38.231
we then add another technology to do video conferencing.

00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.716
But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.

00:08:41.716 --> 00:08:44.366
And now we've got the words,

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:48.917
and we can apply the special sauce: the translation.

00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:53.297
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:55.581
We work with a fourth technology.

00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:59.565
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs.

00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:04.066
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:06.715
And I'd like to show you our prototype

00:09:06.715 --> 00:09:11.548
of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other

00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:15.215
to become something useful.

00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:19.011
Narrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.

00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:22.624
Module five: manual skills practice.

00:09:22.624 --> 00:09:29.907
Students may display captions in their native language.

00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:31.656
Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:33.541
you click the "I want it in Spanish" button

00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:37.173
and out it comes in real time in Spanish.

00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:40.007
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,

00:09:40.007 --> 00:09:43.340
by using technology in a constructive fashion,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.606
you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian --

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:52.072
on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:54.272
But that's the lectures.

00:09:54.272 --> 00:09:57.123
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,

00:09:57.123 --> 00:10:00.140
it's knowledge and skills.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.423
The difference in an operation

00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:07.023
between doing something successfully and not

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.490
may be moving your hand this much.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.790
So we're going to take it one step further;

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.923
we've brought my friend Allan back.

00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:20.024
Allan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.

00:10:20.024 --> 00:10:22.022
This is how you hold the needle.

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:27.519
Grab the needle at the tip.

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.977
It's important to be accurate.

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.810
Aim for the black dots.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.259
Orient your loop this way.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:41.844
Now go ahead and cut.

00:10:41.844 --> 00:10:45.732
Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week.

00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:48.598
SS: So that's what we're working on

00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:51.581
in our quest for the universal translator.

00:10:51.581 --> 00:10:53.665
We want it to be bi-directional.

00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:57.866
We have a need to learn as well as to teach.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:01.882
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this.

00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:04.632
As we think about intersecting technologies --

00:11:04.632 --> 00:11:07.032
everybody has a cell phone with a camera --

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:09.248
we could use this everywhere,

00:11:09.248 --> 00:11:11.331
whether it be health care, patient care,

00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:15.816
engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.

00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:18.216
This is a ubiquitous tool.

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:20.415
In order to break down our barriers,

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:22.182
we have to learn to talk to people,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:26.182
to demand that people work on translation.

00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:28.532
We need it for our everyday life,

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:31.366
in order to make the world a smaller place.

00:11:31.366 --> 00:11:33.066
Thank you very much.

00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:35.448
