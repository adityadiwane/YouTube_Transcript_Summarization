00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:18.343
"Where are you from?"
said the pale, tattooed man.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:23.103
"Where are you from?"

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:27.493
It's September 21, 2001,

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:33.615
10 days after the worst attack
on America since World War II.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.940
Everyone wonders about the next plane.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.682
People are looking for scapegoats.

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:46.490
The president, 
the night before, pledges to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.744
"bring our enemies to justice 
or bring justice to our enemies."

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:58.493
And in the Dallas mini-mart,

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:04.266
a Dallas mini-part surrounded
by tire shops and strip joints

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.273
a Bangladeshi immigrant 
works the register.

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:15.315
Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan
was a big man, an Air Force officer.

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:18.919
But he dreamed of a 
fresh start in America.

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:24.217
If he had to work briefly in a mini-mart
to save up for I.T. classes

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.805
and his wedding in two months, so be it.

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:32.785
Then, on September 21, 
that tattooed man enters the mart.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:35.046
He holds a shotgun.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.159
Raisuddin knows the drill:

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.828
puts cash on the counter.

00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:46.519
This time, the man doesn't 
touch the money.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:50.990
"Where are you from?" he asks.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.192
"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.

00:01:56.192 --> 00:02:00.317
His accent betrays him.

00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:05.334
The tattooed man, a self-styled
true American vigilante,

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:10.083
shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:14.732
Raisuddin feels millions of bees
stinging his face.

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:22.279
In fact, dozens of scalding, 
birdshot pellets puncture his head.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.859
Behind the counter, he lays in blood.

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.350
He cups a hand over his forehead
to keep in the brains

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.128
on which he'd gambled everything.

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:40.857
He recites verses from the Koran,
begging his God to live.

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:45.172
He senses he is dying.

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:47.690
He didn't die.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.006
His right eye left him.

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.591
His fiancÃ©e left him.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.691
His landlord, the mini-mart owner,
kicked him out.

00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:04.004
Soon he was homeless and 
60,000 dollars in medical debt,

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:08.206
including a fee for dialing 
for an ambulance.

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:12.458
But Raisuddin lived.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:18.453
And years later, he would ask
what he could do to repay his God

00:03:18.453 --> 00:03:21.212
and become worthy of this second chance.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:23.883
He would come to believe, in fact,

00:03:23.883 --> 00:03:29.611
that this chance called for him
to give a second chance

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:34.184
to a man we might think
deserved no chance at all.

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:41.632
Twelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate
seeking my way in the world.

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:44.132
Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants,

00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:47.399
I settled on the ultimate rebellion 
against my parents,

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:52.429
moving to the country they had worked
so damn hard to get out of.

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:58.020
What I thought might be a six-month stint
in Mumbai stretched to six years.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.665
I became a writer and found myself
amid a magical story:

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:07.182
the awakening of hope across much
of the so-called Third World.

00:04:07.182 --> 00:04:12.238
Six years ago, I returned to America
and realized something:

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:15.302
The American Dream was thriving,

00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:18.825
but only in India.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.270
In America, not so much.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.093
In fact, I observed that 
America was fracturing

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:28.327
into two distinct societies:

00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:32.966
a republic of dreams
and a republic of fears.

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:36.317
And then, I stumbled onto this 
incredible tale of two lives

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:43.640
and of these two Americas that brutally
collided in that Dallas mini-mart.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.041
I knew at once I wanted to learn more,

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:48.812
and eventually that I would write
a book about them,

00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:52.694
for their story was the story 
of America's fracturing

00:04:52.694 --> 00:04:58.280
and of how it might be put back together.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.260
After he was shot, Raisuddin's life
grew no easier.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.960
The day after admitting him,
the hospital discharged him.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.938
His right eye couldn't see.

00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:10.546
He couldn't speak.

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:13.665
Metal peppered his face.

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:17.846
But he had no insurance, 
so they bounced him.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:21.970
His family in Bangladesh 
begged him, "Come home."

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.228
But he told them he had 
a dream to see about.

00:05:27.148 --> 00:05:29.699
He found telemarketing work,

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.974
then he became an Olive Garden waiter,

00:05:32.974 --> 00:05:37.094
because where better to get over his fear
of white people than the Olive Garden?

00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:40.434
(Laughter)

00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:44.991
Now, as a devout Muslim,
he refused alcohol,

00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:47.188
didn't touch the stuff.

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:52.215
Then he learned that not selling it
would slash his pay.

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:56.006
So he reasoned, like a budding 
American pragmatist,

00:05:56.006 --> 00:06:00.138
"Well, God wouldn't want me
to starve, would he?"

00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:03.406
And before long, in some months, 
Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:07.477
highest grossing alcohol pusher.

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:11.364
He found a man who taught him
database administration.

00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:13.486
He got part-time I.T. gigs.

00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:18.718
Eventually, he landed a six-figure job
at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.

00:06:20.048 --> 00:06:24.816
But as America began
to work for Raisuddin,

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:28.853
he avoided the classic
error of the fortunate:

00:06:28.853 --> 00:06:32.777
assuming you're the rule, 
not the exception.

00:06:32.777 --> 00:06:38.576
In fact, he observed that many with
the fortune of being born American

00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:45.298
were nonetheless trapped in lives that 
made second chances like his impossible.

00:06:45.298 --> 00:06:48.729
He saw it at the Olive Garden itself,

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.239
where so many of his colleagues had
childhood horror stories

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:56.956
of family dysfunction, chaos, 
addiction, crime.

00:06:56.956 --> 00:07:01.407
He'd heard a similar tale about
the man who shot him

00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:04.059
back when he attended his trial.

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:09.789
The closer Raisuddin got to the America
he had coveted from afar,

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.973
the more he realized there was
another, equally real, America

00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:18.295
that was stingier with second chances.

00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:25.890
The man who shot Raisuddin grew up
in that stingier America.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.980
From a distance, Mark Stroman
was always the spark of parties,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.543
always making girls feel pretty.

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:39.139
Always working, no matter what 
drugs or fights he'd had the night before.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.244
But he'd always wrestled with demons.

00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:45.749
He entered the world through
the three gateways

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.471
that doom so many young American men:

00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:53.340
bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.871
His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy

00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:02.214
that she'd been just 50 dollars 
short of aborting him.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:08.078
Sometimes, that little boy 
would be at school,

00:08:08.078 --> 00:08:12.579
he'd suddenly pull a knife 
on his fellow classmates.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:16.187
Sometimes that same little boy
would be at his grandparents',

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:18.934
tenderly feeding horses.

00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:21.379
He was getting arrested before he shaved,

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.805
first juvenile, then prison.

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:26.944
He became a casual white supremacist

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:32.656
and, like so many around him, 
a drug-addled and absent father.

00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:37.564
And then, before long,
he found himself on death row,

00:08:37.564 --> 00:08:43.688
for in his 2001 counter-jihad, 
he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,

00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:45.596
but three.

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:47.884
Only Raisuddin survived.

00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:53.808
Strangely, death row was 
the first institution

00:08:53.808 --> 00:08:57.341
that left Stroman better.

00:08:57.341 --> 00:08:59.569
His old influences quit him.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:03.225
The people entering his life 
were virtuous and caring:

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:07.989
pastors, journalists, European pen-pals.

00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:14.282
They listened to him, prayed with him,
helped him question himself.

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:19.428
And sent him on a journey 
of introspection and betterment.

00:09:19.428 --> 00:09:24.362
He finally faced the hatred 
that had defined his life.

00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:27.253
He read Viktor Frankl, 
the Holocaust survivor

00:09:27.253 --> 00:09:30.633
and regretted his swastika tattoos.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.925
He found God.

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:37.152
Then one day in 2011, 
10 years after his crimes,

00:09:37.152 --> 00:09:39.591
Stroman received news.

00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:47.384
One of the men he'd shot, the survivor,
was fighting to save his life.

00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:53.173
You see, late in 2009,
eight years after that shooting,

00:09:53.173 --> 00:09:59.196
Raisuddin had gone on his own journey,
a pilgrimage to Mecca.

00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:03.450
Amid its crowds, 
he felt immense gratitude,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.245
but also duty.

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:09.034
He recalled promising God, 
as he lay dying in 2001,

00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:14.234
that if he lived, he would serve 
humanity all his days.

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:19.529
Then, he'd gotten busy 
relaying the bricks of a life.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:22.912
Now it was time to pay his debts.

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:27.872
And he decided, upon reflection,
that his method of payment

00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:31.135
would be an intervention 
in the cycle of vengeance

00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:33.994
between the Muslim and Western worlds.

00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:36.689
And how would he intervene?

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:40.991
By forgiving Stroman publicly
in the name of Islam

00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:42.731
and its doctrine of mercy.

00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:49.292
And then suing the state of Texas
and its governor Rick Perry

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:52.997
to prevent them from executing Stroman,

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:56.111
exactly like most people 
shot in the face do.

00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:58.475
(Laughter)

00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:05.701
Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired 
not only by faith.

00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:11.759
A newly minted American citizen,
he had come to believe that Stroman

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:18.739
was the product of a hurting America that
couldn't just be lethally injected away.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:23.204
That insight is what moved me 
to write my book "The True American."

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:27.851
This immigrant begging America 
to be as merciful to a native son

00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:31.608
as it had been to an adopted one.

00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:35.621
In the mini-mart, all those years earlier,

00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:40.047
not just two men, 
but two Americas collided.

00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:42.968
An America that still dreams, 
still strives,

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:47.047
still imagines that tomorrow
can build on today,

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:50.146
and an America that has resigned to fate,

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:53.280
buckled under stress and chaos,
lowered expectations,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.418
an ducked into the oldest of refuges:

00:11:56.418 --> 00:12:00.218
the tribal fellowship of one's
own narrow kind.

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:02.888
And it was Raisuddin, despite
being a newcomer,

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.215
despite being attacked,

00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:07.088
despite being homeless and traumatized,

00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:10.492
who belonged to that republic of dreams

00:12:10.492 --> 00:12:15.103
and Stroman who belonged to that 
other wounded country,

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:20.418
despite being born with the privilege
of a native white man.

00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:26.704
I realized these men's stories formed
an urgent parable about America.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.723
The country I am so proud to call my own

00:12:30.723 --> 00:12:34.589
wasn't living through a 
generalized decline

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:41.683
as seen in Spain or Greece, 
where prospects were dimming for everyone.

00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:46.680
America is simultaneously the most
and the least successful country

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.027
in the industrialized world.

00:12:49.027 --> 00:12:51.571
Launching the world's best companies,

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:54.970
even as record numbers 
of children go hungry.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.125
Seeing life-expectancy drop
for large groups,

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:02.831
even as it polishes 
the world's best hospitals.

00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:07.134
America today is a sprightly young body,

00:13:07.134 --> 00:13:12.952
hit by one of those strokes 
that sucks the life from one side,

00:13:12.952 --> 00:13:16.440
while leaving the other
worryingly perfect.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:24.056
On July 20, 2011, right after 
a sobbing Raisuddin

00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:26.355
testified in defense of Stroman's life,

00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:32.679
Stroman was killed by lethal injection
by the state he so loved.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:37.232
Hours earlier, when Raisuddin still
thought he could still save Stroman,

00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:40.200
the two men got to speak 
for the second time ever.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.592
Here is an excerpt from their phone call.

00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:49.450
Raisuddin: "Mark, you should know 
that I am praying for God,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.493
the most compassionate and gracious.

00:13:52.493 --> 00:13:54.961
I forgive you and I do not hate you.

00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:57.952
I never hated you."

00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:02.396
Stroman: "You are a remarkable person.

00:14:02.396 --> 00:14:04.513
Thank you from my heart.

00:14:04.513 --> 00:14:07.400
I love you, bro."

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.318
Even more amazingly, after the execution,

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:15.530
Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's 
eldest daughter, Amber,

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.273
an ex-convinct and an addict.

00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:20.060
and offered his help.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.058
"You may have lost a father,"
he told her,

00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:26.600
"but you've gained an uncle."

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:32.483
He wanted her, too, to have 
a second chance.

00:14:32.483 --> 00:14:37.618
If human history were a parade,

00:14:37.618 --> 00:14:44.325
America's float would be 
a neon shrine to second chances.

00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:50.025
But America, generous with second chances
to the children of other lands,

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:56.241
today grows miserly with first chances
to the children of its own.

00:14:56.241 --> 00:15:01.168
America still dazzles at allowing
anybody to become an American.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:07.811
But it is losing its luster at allowing
every American to become a somebody.

00:15:07.811 --> 00:15:12.583
Over the last decade, seven million
foreigners gained American citizenship.

00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:14.607
Remarkable.

00:15:14.607 --> 00:15:19.912
In the meanwhile, how many Americans
gained a place in the middle class?

00:15:19.912 --> 00:15:23.682
Actually, the net influx was negative.

00:15:23.682 --> 00:15:25.981
Go back further, 
and it's even more striking:

00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:31.212
Since the 60s, the middle class
has shrunk by 20 percent,

00:15:31.212 --> 00:15:34.564
mainly because of the people
tumbling out of it.

00:15:34.564 --> 00:15:38.226
And my reporting around the country
tells me the problem is grimmer

00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:40.639
than simple inequality.

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:46.574
What I observe is a pair of secessions
from the unifying center of American life.

00:15:46.574 --> 00:15:50.102
An affluent secession of up, up and away,

00:15:50.102 --> 00:15:53.534
into elite enclaves of the educated
and into a global matrix

00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:56.317
of work, money and connections,

00:15:56.317 --> 00:16:00.415
and an impoverished secession 
of down and out

00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:03.159
into disconnected, dead-end lives

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:07.183
that the fortunate scarcely see.

00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:12.468
And don't console yourself 
that you are the 99 percent.

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:18.504
If you live near a Whole Foods,

00:16:18.504 --> 00:16:22.167
if no one in your family serves 
in the military,

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:27.386
if you're paid by the year,
not the hour,

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:30.783
if most people you know finished college,

00:16:30.783 --> 00:16:33.105
if no one you know uses meth,

00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:35.285
if you married once and remain married,

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:39.627
if you're not one of 65 million Americans
with a criminal record --

00:16:39.627 --> 00:16:43.409
if any or all of these things 
describe you,

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:46.276
then accept the possibility that actually,

00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:48.699
you may not know what's going on

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:54.588
and you may be part of the problem.

00:16:54.588 --> 00:17:00.576
Other generations had to build 
a fresh society after slavery,

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:04.840
pull through a depression,
defeat fascism,

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.569
freedom-ride in Mississippi.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.096
The moral challenge of 
my generation, I believe,

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:13.213
is to reacquaint these two Americas,

00:17:13.213 --> 00:17:18.392
to choose union over secession once again.

00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:22.337
This ins't a problem we can tax
or tax-cut away.

00:17:22.337 --> 00:17:26.527
It won't be solved by tweeting harder,
building slicker apps,

00:17:26.527 --> 00:17:30.965
or starting one more 
artisanal coffee roasting service.

00:17:30.965 --> 00:17:37.232
It is a moral challenge that begs 
each of us in the flourishing America

00:17:37.232 --> 00:17:41.327
to take on the wilting America as our own,

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:44.342
as Raisuddin tried to do.

00:17:44.342 --> 00:17:46.923
Like him, we can make pilgrimages.

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:50.446
And there, in Baltimore and Oregon 
and Appalachia,

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:52.938
find new purpose, as he did.

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:56.197
We can immerse ourselves 
in that other country,

00:17:56.197 --> 00:17:59.974
bear witness to its hopes and sorrows,

00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:06.829
and, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.

00:18:06.829 --> 00:18:09.955
What can you do?

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.706
What can you do?

00:18:11.706 --> 00:18:13.679
What can we do?

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:18.726
How might we build 
a more merciful country?

00:18:18.726 --> 00:18:22.933
We, the greatest inventors in the world,

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:27.948
can invent solutions to the problems 
of that America, not only our own.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:31.350
We, the writers and the journalists, 
can cover that America's stories,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.946
instead of shutting down 
bureaus in its midst.

00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:38.190
We can finance that America's ideas,

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.405
instead of ideas from New York 
and San Francisco.

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:44.250
We can put our stethoscopes to its backs,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:50.475
teach there, go to court there,
make there, live there, pray there.

00:18:50.475 --> 00:18:55.272
This, I believe, is the calling 
of a generation.

00:18:55.272 --> 00:18:58.758
An America whose two halves learn again

00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:04.404
to stride, to plow, to forge,
to dare together.

00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:12.099
A republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,

00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:15.777
begins with us.

00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:17.616
Thank you.

00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:22.563
(Applause)
