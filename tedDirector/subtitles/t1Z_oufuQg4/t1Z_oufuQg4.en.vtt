00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Do you remember the story

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
of Odysseus and the Sirens

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
from high school or junior high school?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
after the Trojan War.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And he's standing on the deck of his ship,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
he's talking to his first mate,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and he's saying,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and on those rocks sit some beautiful women

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
called Sirens.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And these women sing an enchanting song,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
a song so alluring

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that all sailors who hear it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
crash into the rocks and die."

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Now you would expect, given that,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but instead Odysseus says,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
"I want to hear that song.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And so what I'm going to do

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
is I'm going to pour wax in the ears

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
of you and all the men --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
stay with me --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
so that you can't hear the song,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
so that I can listen

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and we can all sail by unaffected."

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So this is a captain

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
so that he can hear a song.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And I'd like to think if this was the case,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
All right, so tie me to the mast."

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And the first mate takes a rope

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And Odysseus does his best job playacting

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and says, "Untie me. Untie me.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I want to hear that song. Untie me."

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And the first mate wisely resists

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and doesn't untie Odysseus.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And the first mate hesitates.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
or should I untie him?"

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And the first mate thinks,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
He's like, "You idiot. You moron.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
every single one of the men will be dead.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Now just don't untie me no matter what."

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
He throws the first mate to the ground.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
This repeats itself through the night --

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
rehearsal, tying to the mast,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
conning his way out of it,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Hilarity ensues.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Tying yourself to a mast

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
is perhaps the oldest written example

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
of what psychologists call a commitment device.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
A commitment device is a decision that you make

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
with a cool head to bind yourself

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
so that you don't do something regrettable

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
when you have a hot head.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Because there's two heads inside one person

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
when you think about it.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
when it comes to questions of temptation.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
There is first, the present self.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
He just wants to get to the front row.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
But then there's this other self, the future self.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
This is Odysseus as an old man

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
with his wife Penelope

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
outside of Ithaca -- the other one.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
So why do we need commitment devices?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Well resisting temptation is hard,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
as the 19th century English economist

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Nassau William Senior said,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
or to seek distant rather than immediate results,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
are among the most painful exertions

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
of the human will."

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
you probably realize

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
it's not that your goals are physically impossible

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that's keeping you from achieving them,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
It's physically possible to lose weight.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
It's physically possible to exercise more.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
But resisting temptation

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
is hard.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
The other reason

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that it's difficult to resist temptation

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is because it's an unequal battle

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
between the present self and the future self.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It's in control. It's in power right now.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
It has these strong, heroic arms

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And the future self is not even around.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
It's off in the future. It's weak.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
It doesn't even have a lawyer present.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
There's nobody to stick up for the future self.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And so the present self can trounce

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
all over its dreams.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and we need commitment devices

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
to level the playing field between the two.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.260
such as locking a credit card away with a key

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
or unplugging your Internet connection

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
so you can use your computer.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I was creating commitment devices of my own

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
long before I knew what they were.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So when I was a starving post-doc

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
at Columbia University,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
I had to write five pages a day

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
towards papers

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or I would have to give up five dollars.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And when you try to execute these commitment devices,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
you realize the devil is really in the details.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
or give it to my wife or something like that.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So then I would kind of justify not writing

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
by giving a gift.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and so that wouldn't work.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So ultimately, I just decided

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Sometimes a good person would find it,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
sometimes a bad person would find it.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
that I would regret.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
(Laughter)

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Such it is with commitment devices.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But despite my like for them,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
there's two nagging concerns

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
that I've always had about commitment devices,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and you might feel this if you use them yourself.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
So the first is,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
when you've got one of these devices going,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
such as this contract to write everyday or pay,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
it's just a constant reminder

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that you have no self-control.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And then when you're ever in a situation

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
where you don't have a commitment device in place --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and I have no defense mechanism," --

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
you just eat it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
The other problem with commitment devices

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
is that you can always weasel your way out of them.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And so there's no way that this is going to work."

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
in one person.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
and you're weaseling your way out of it,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and then you're beating yourself up afterwards.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So I've been working

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
for about a decade now

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
on finding other ways

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
to change people's relationship to the future self

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
without using commitment devices.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
to the future financial self.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And this is a timely issue.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
I'm talking about the topic of saving.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Now saving is a classic two selves problem.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
The present self does not want to save at all.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
It wants to consume.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
So this is a timely problem.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We look at the savings rate

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and it has been declining since the 1950s.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
has been increasing.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And we're at a situation now

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
where for every three baby boomers,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
the McKinsey Global Institute predicts

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
while they're in retirement.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So what can we do about this?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
He said that, "We might neglect our future selves

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
because of some failure of belief or imagination."

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
That is to say,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
or we might not be able to imagine

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that we're going to get old some day.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Of course, we know that we're going to get old.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So my coauthors and I have used computers,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
the greatest tool of our time,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
to assist people's imagination

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and help them imagine what it might be like

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to go into the future.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And I'll show you some of these tools right here.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
The first is called the distribution builder.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
It shows people what the future might be like

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
that might be obtained in the future.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and each sits on a row

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
that represents a level of wealth and retirement.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Being up at the top

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Being down at the bottom

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
means that you're struggling to make ends meet.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
When you make an investment,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
what you're really saying is, "I accept

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that any one of these 100 things

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
could happen to me and determine my wealth."

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Now you can try to move your outcomes around.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
but it costs you something to do it.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.260
It means that you have to save more today.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
Once you find an investment that you're happy with,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
what people do is they click "done"

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
and the markers begin to disappear,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
slowly, one by one.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
It simulates what it is like to invest in something

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and to watch that investment pan out.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
At the end, there will only be one marker left standing

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and it will determine our wealth in retirement.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Yes, this person retired

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.260
at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
They're making more money while retired

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
than they were making while they were working.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
If you're like most people,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.260
just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
just to think about making

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
50 percent more money in retirement than before.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
However, had you ended up on the very bottom,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
it might have given you a slight sense

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
of dread and/or nausea

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.260
thinking about struggling to get by in retirement.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
By using this tool over and over

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
and simulating outcome after outcome,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
people can understand

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
that the investments and savings that they undertake today

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
determine their well-being in the future.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Now people are motivated through emotions,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
but different people find different things motivating.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
This is a simulation

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
that uses graphics,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
but other people find motivating what money can buy,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
not just numbers.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
So here I made a distribution builder

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
where instead of showing numerical outcomes,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I show people what those outcomes will get you,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
in particular apartments that you can afford

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
2,000 dollars per month and so on.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
As you move down the ladder of apartments,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
you see that they get worse and worse.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And as you get to the very bottom,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
you're faced with the unfortunate reality

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that if you don't save anything for retirement,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
you won't be able to afford any housing at all.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
renting for that amount

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
as advertised on the Internet.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
The last thing I'll show you,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
the last behavioral time machine,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Bill Sharpe.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And what it is

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
is an exploration into virtual reality.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
So what we do is we take pictures of people --

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
in this case, college-age people --

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and we use software to age them

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and show these people what they'll look like

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And we try to test

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
whether actually assisting your imagination

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
by looking at the face of your future self

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
can change you investment behavior.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
So this is one of our experiments.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
He's given a control

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that allows him to adjust his savings rate.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
As he moves his savings rate down,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
it means that he's saving zero

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
when it's all the way here at the left.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
You can see his current annual income --

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
is quite high, 91 percent,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but his retirement income is quite low.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
He's going to retire on 44 percent

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
of what he earned while he was working.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
If he saves the maximum legal amount,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
his retirement income goes up,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
but he's unhappy

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Other conditions show people the future self.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
If you save very little,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
the future self is unhappy

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
living on 44 percent of the income.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Whereas if the present self saves a lot,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
the future self is delighted,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
where the income is close up near 100 percent.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
To bring this to a wider audience,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I've been working with Hal and Allianz

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
to create something we call the behavioral time machine,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
to different levels of retirement wealth.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So for instance,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
here is somebody using the tool.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And just watch the facial expressions

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
as they move the slider.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
The older face is miserable.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And then it's a high savings rate.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
The younger face is getting unhappy.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
The older face is quite pleased

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
with the decision.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And what's nice about it

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
is it's not something that biasing people actually,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
because as one face smiles,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
the other face frowns.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
It's not telling you which way to put the slider,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
it's just reminding you that you are

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
connected to and legally tied to

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
this future self.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And that's something that's easy to forget.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
This use of virtual reality

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
is not just good for making people look older.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
There are programs you can get

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
to see how people might look

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
if they gain weight and so on.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And what's good is,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
you don't have to program these by yourself

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
in order to see the virtual reality.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
that do the same thing.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
You might recognize him from the previous demos.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And just for kicks we ran his picture

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
through the balding, aging and weight gain software

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
to see how he would look.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
to disabuse you of that last image.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And I'll close it there.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
On behalf of Hal and myself,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
I wish all the best to your present and future selves.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Thank you.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
(Applause)
