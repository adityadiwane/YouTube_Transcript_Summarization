00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
And I promised to come back and give you an update

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
on how that machine worked.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Its job is to recreate the conditions

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
up to 600 million times a second.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
It's nothing if not ambitious.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
This is the machine below Geneva.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
so you can see the scale.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
It caused immense celebration in the control room.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
It's a picture of the first beam particle

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
going all the way around the LHC,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
and showering particles into the detector.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
we knew the machine worked,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
which is a great triumph.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
or this, when someone went onto Google

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
and saw the front page was like that.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
It means we made cultural impact

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
as well as scientific impact.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
About a week later we had a problem with the machine,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
when the machine is working in full power.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
"No they don't. They're small wires."

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
They can do that because

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
So at minus 271 degrees,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
colder than the space between the stars,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
those wires can take that current.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
there was a manufacturing defect.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
So the wire heated up slightly,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
This was the result.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Now that's more impressive

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and they moved about a foot.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
We had to take them out, which we did.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
They're all on their way back underground now.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
We will switch it on,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and we expect to take data in June or July,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and continue with our quest to find out

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
what the building blocks of the universe are.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
Now of course, in a way

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
those accidents reignite the debate

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.160
about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
I think that the fact that it's so difficult,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
who, I suspect,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
when defending his protege's useless experiments --

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
his protege was Michael Faraday --

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
said this, "Nothing is so dangerous

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
to the progress of the human mind

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
that there are no mysteries in nature,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
that our triumphs are complete, and that

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
there are no new worlds to conquer."

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Thank you.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
(Applause)
