00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This cell phone

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
started its trajectory

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in an artisanal mine

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
in the Eastern Congo.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
It's mined by armed gangs

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
using slaves, child slaves,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
what the U.N. Security Council

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
calls "blood minerals,"

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
then traveled into some components

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and ended up in a factory

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
in Shinjin in China.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
already this year.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
We all love chocolate.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
We buy it for our kids.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and it's harvested by children.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to come and work on the coffee plantations.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Heparin -- a blood thinner,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
a pharmaceutical product --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
starts out in artisanal workshops

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
like this in China,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
because the active ingredient

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
comes from pigs' intestines.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
This is a mine in Zimbabwe

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
right now.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
exporter of cotton on Earth.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
the government shuts down the schools,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It's forced child labor

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
on an institutional scale.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And all of those products probably end their lives

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in a dump like this one in Manila.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
These places, these origins,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
represent governance gaps.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
That's the politest description

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I have for them.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
These are the dark pools

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
where global supply chains begin --

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
the global supply chains,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
which bring us our favorite brand name products.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Some of these governance gaps

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are run by rogue states.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Some of them are not states anymore at all.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
They're failed states.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Some of them

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
is the best way to attract investment,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
promote trade.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Either way, they present us

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
I know that none of us want to be accessories

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
after the fact

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
of a human rights abuse

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
in a global supply chain.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
But right now,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
most of the companies involved in these supply chains

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
don't have any way

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
of assuring us

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
that nobody had to mortgage their future,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
nobody had to sacrifice their rights

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
to bring us our favorite

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
brand name product.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Now, I didn't come here to depress you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
about the state of the global supply chain.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
We need a reality check.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
We need to recognize just how serious

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
a deficit of rights we have.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
This is an independent republic,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
probably a failed state.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's definitely not a democratic state.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And right now,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that independent republic of the supply chain

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
is not being governed

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
in a way that would satisfy us,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Now, that's not a new story.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
You've seen the documentaries

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
of sweatshops making garments

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
all over the world, even in developed countries.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
You want to see the classic sweatshop,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
meet me at Madison Square Garden,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But take the example of heparin.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's a pharmaceutical product.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
probably squeaky clean.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
The problem is that the active ingredient in there --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
as I mentioned earlier --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
comes from pigs.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
The main American manufacturer

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
of that active ingredient

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
decided a few years ago to relocate to China

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And their factory in China --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
which probably is pretty clean --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is getting all of the ingredients

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
from backyard abattoirs,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
where families slaughter pigs

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and extract the ingredient.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
which killed about 80 people around the world,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
because of contaminants

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that crept into the heparin supply chain.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Worse, some of the suppliers

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.260
realized that they could substitute a product

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
which mimicked heparin in tests.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
cost 900 dollars a pound.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
A no-brainer.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
The problem was that it killed more people.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And so you're asking yourself,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
allowed this to happen?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
allow this to happen?"

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And the answer is quite simple:

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
the Chinese define these facilities

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
so they don't audit them.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And the USFDA

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
has a jurisdictional problem.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
This is offshore.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
There are 500

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
of these facilities

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
producing active ingredients in China alone.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
In fact, about 80 percent

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
of the active ingredients in medicines now

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
come from offshore,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
particularly China and India,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and we don't have a governance system.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
We don't have a regulatory system

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
able to ensure

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that that production is safe.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
We don't have a system to ensure

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
that human rights, basic dignity,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
are ensured.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
So at a national level --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and we work in about 60 different countries --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
at a national level

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
to regulate production

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
on their own soil.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And the real problem with the global supply chain

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
is that it's supranational.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
So governments who are failing,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
who are dropping the ball

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
at a national level,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
have even less ability to get their arms around the problem

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
at an international level.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And you can just look at the headlines.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Take Copenhagen last year --

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
complete failure of governments

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
to do the right thing

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
in the face of an international challenge.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
You can take any one

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
of the major global challenges we've discussed this week

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
to step up and come up with solutions,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
responses,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to those international problems?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Their voters are local.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
They have parochial interests.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
They can't subordinate those interests

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
to the greater global public good.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
So, if we're going to ensure the delivery

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
of the key public goods

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
at an international level --

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
in this case, in the global supply chain --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
we have to come up with a different mechanism.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
We need a different machine.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Fortunately, we have some examples.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
In the 1990s,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
there were a whole series of scandals

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
child labor, forced labor,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
serious health and safety abuses.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
convened a meeting at the White House,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
invited industry, human rights NGOs,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
trade unions, the Department of Labor,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
got them all in a room

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and said, "Look,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
I don't know how to prevent that,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
but I'm at least going to use my good offices

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
to get you folks together

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
to come up with a response."

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
So they formed a White House task force,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and they spent about three years arguing

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
about who takes how much responsibility

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
in the global supply chain.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
They don't own those facilities.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
They don't employ those workers.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
They're not legally liable.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Everybody else at the table

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to make sure that that product

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
gets from wherever to the store

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in a way that allows us to consume it,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
without fear of our safety,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.260
or without having to sacrifice our conscience

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
to consume that product."

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
is we agree on a common set of standards,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
code of conduct.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
We'll apply that throughout

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
our global supply chain

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
regardless of ownership or control.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We'll make it part of the contract."

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And that was a stroke of absolute genius,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
because what they did

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
was they harnessed the power of the contract,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
private power,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
to deliver public goods.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And let's face it,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
the contract from a major multinational brand

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to a supplier in India or China

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
has much more persuasive value

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
than the local labor law,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
the local environmental regulations,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
the local human rights standards.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Those factories will probably never see an inspector.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
If the inspector did come along,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
it would be amazing if they were able

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to resist the bribe.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Even if they did their jobs,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and they cited those facilities for their violations,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
the fine would be derisory.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
But you lose that contract

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
for a major brand name,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
that's the difference

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
between staying in business or going bankrupt.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
That makes a difference.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
So what we've been able to do

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
is we've been able to harness

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
the power and the influence

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
of the only truly transnational institution

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
in the global supply chain,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that of the multinational company,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and get them to do the right thing,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
get them to use that power for good,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
to deliver the key public goods.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Now of course, this doesn't come naturally

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
to multinational companies.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
But they are extremely efficient organizations.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
They have resources,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and if we can add the will, the commitment,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
they know how to deliver that product.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Now, getting there is not easy.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
they're not there.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
You need a safe space.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
You need a place where people can come together,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
sit down without fear of judgment,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
without recrimination,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
to actually face the problem,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
agree on the problem and come up with solutions.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
We can do it. The technical solutions are there.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
the lack of partnership

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
between NGOs, campaign groups,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
civil society organizations

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and multinational companies.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
If we can put those two together in a safe space,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
get them to work together,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
we can deliver public goods right now,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
or in extremely short supply.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
This is a radical proposition,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and it's crazy to think

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
leaving your rural village

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
to go and work in a factory in Dhaka --

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
22, 23, 24 dollars a month --

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
your best chance of enjoying rights at work

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
is if that factory is producing

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
for a brand name company

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
which has got a code of conduct

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and made that code of conduct part of the contract.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It's crazy.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Multinationals are protecting human rights.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
I know there's going to be disbelief.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
You'll say, "How can we trust them?"

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Well, we don't.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
It's the old arms control phrase:

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
"Trust, but verify."

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So we audit.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
we do a random sample,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
we send inspectors on an unannounced basis

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
to inspect those facilities,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and then we publish the results.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Transparency is absolutely critical to this.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
You can call yourself responsible,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
but responsibility without accountability

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
often doesn't work.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
respect for human rights --

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and we're checking.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Go to the website. Look at the audit results.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Ask yourself, is this company behaving

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
in a socially responsible way?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Can I buy that product

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
without compromising my ethics?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
That's the way the system works.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
I hate the idea

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I hate the idea

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
that governments have dropped this ball

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
and I can't get used to the idea

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
I've been at this for 30 years,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
and in that time I've seen

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
the ability, the commitment, the will of government

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
to do this decline,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
and I don't see them making a comeback right now.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So we started out thinking

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
this was a stopgap measure.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
We're now thinking that, in fact,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
this is probably the start

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
of a new way of regulating and addressing

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
international challenges.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Call it network governance. Call it what you will.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
The private actors,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
companies and NGOs,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
are going to have to get together

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
to face the major challenges we are going to face.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Just look at pandemics --

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Look at the health systems in so many countries.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Do they have the resources

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
to face up to a serious pandemic?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
No.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Could the private sector and NGOs

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
get together and marshal a response?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Absolutely.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
What they lack is that safe space

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
to come together, agree

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and move to action.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
That's what we're trying to provide.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
I know as well

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
that this often seems

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
like an overwhelming level of responsibility

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
for people to assume.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
"You want me to deliver human rights

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
throughout my global supply chain.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
There are thousands of suppliers in there."

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
It seems too daunting, too dangerous,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
for any company to take on.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
But there are companies.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
We have 4,000 companies who are members.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Some of them are very, very large companies.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
The sporting goods industry, in particular,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
stepped up to the plate and have done it.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
The example, the role model, is there.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And whenever we discuss

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
one of these problems that we have to address --

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
child labor in cottonseed farms in India --

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
It seems overwhelming.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
The numbers just make you want to zone out.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
But we break it down to some basic realities.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And human rights

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
comes down to a very simple proposition:

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
can I give this person their dignity back?

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
Poor people,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
people whose human rights have been violated --

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
the crux of that

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
is the loss of dignity,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
the lack of dignity.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
It starts with just giving people back their dignity.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
just next to Delhi,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
one of the flashiest, brightest new cities

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
popping up in India right now,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and I was talking to workers

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
who worked in garment sweatshops down the road,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
They didn't say money.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
They said, "The people who employ us

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
treat us like we are less than human,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
like we don't exist.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Please ask them to treat us like human beings."

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
That's my simple understanding of human rights.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
That's my simple proposition to you,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
my simple plea to every decision-maker

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
in this room, everybody out there.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
We can all make a decision

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
to come together

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
and pick up the balls and run with the balls

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that governments have dropped.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
If we don't do it,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
we're abandoning hope,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
we're abandoning our essential humanity,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
and I know that's not a place we want to be,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
and we don't have to be there.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
So I appeal to you.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Join us, come into that safe space,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
and let's start to make this happen.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
(Applause)
