00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:14.388
In the middle of my Ph.D.,

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:17.850
I was hopelessly stuck.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.630
Every research direction that I tried

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.246
led to a dead end.

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.148
It seemed like my basic assumptions

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.076
just stopped working.

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:28.075
I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:30.870
and I lost all sense of direction.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.351
I stopped shaving.

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.092
I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.

00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:36.825
I felt unworthy

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.978
of stepping across the gates of the university,

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:42.126
because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:44.279
or any other scientist whose results

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:45.810
I had learned about, because in science,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.192
we just learn about the results, not the process.

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:53.893
And so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:55.557
But I had enough support

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:56.954
and I made it through

00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:59.174
and discovered something new about nature.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:01.917
This is an amazing feeling of calmness,

00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:03.249
being the only person in the world

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.474
who knows a new law of nature.

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:08.516
And I started the second project in my Ph.D,

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:09.880
and it happened again.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.169
I got stuck and I made it through.

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:13.555
And I started thinking,

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:14.712
maybe there's a pattern here.

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.553
I asked the other graduate students, and they said,

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:18.596
"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,

00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:20.945
except nobody told us about it."

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.895
We'd all studied science as if it's a series

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:26.471
of logical steps between question and answer,

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:29.217
but doing research is nothing like that.

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:31.551
At the same time, I was also studying

00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.638
to be an improvisation theater actor.

00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:35.072
So physics by day,

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:37.090
and by night, laughing, jumping, singing,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.402
playing my guitar.

00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:39.881
Improvisation theater,

00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.890
just like science, goes into the unknown,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.302
because you have to make a scene onstage

00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:46.005
without a director, without a script,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.283
without having any idea what you'll portray

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:50.689
or what the other characters will do.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.538
But unlike science,

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:55.561
in improvisation theater, they tell you from day one

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.776
what's going to happen to
you when you get onstage.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.548
You're going to fail miserably.

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:01.725
You're going to get stuck.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.843
And we would practice staying creative

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:05.046
inside that stuck place.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:06.951
For example, we had an exercise

00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:08.093
where we all stood in a circle,

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:11.058
and each person had to do
the world's worst tap dance,

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:12.644
and everybody else applauded

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:13.886
and cheered you on,

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.649
supporting you onstage.

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.557
When I became a professor

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:19.938
and had to guide my own students

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:21.911
through their research projects,

00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:23.278
I realized again,

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:24.990
I don't know what to do.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.984
I'd studied thousands of hours of physics,

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:28.598
biology, chemistry,

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:30.970
but not one hour, not one concept

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.556
on how to mentor, how to guide someone

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:35.293
to go together into the unknown,

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:37.214
about motivation.

00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:39.144
So I turned to improvisation theater,

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:41.317
and I told my students from day one

00:02:41.317 --> 00:02:44.218
what's going to happen when you start research,

00:02:44.218 --> 00:02:45.944
and this has to do with our mental schema

00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:47.956
of what research will be like.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:50.234
Because you see, whenever people do anything,

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:52.876
for example if I want to touch this blackboard,

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:54.536
my brain first builds up a schema,

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:56.395
a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do

00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:58.551
before I even start moving my hand,

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.399
and if I get blocked,

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.274
if my schema doesn't match reality,

00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:04.558
that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:07.467
That's why your schemas had better match reality.

00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:10.622
But if you believe the way science is taught,

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:12.519
and if you believe textbooks, you're liable

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.813
to have the following schema of research.

00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:22.131
If A is the question,

00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:25.531
and B is the answer,

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:30.124
then research is a direct path.

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:33.242
The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:36.904
or a student gets depressed,

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.990
it's perceived as something utterly wrong

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.020
and causes tremendous stress.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.803
And that's why I teach my students

00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:47.665
a more realistic schema.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.384
Here's an example

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:55.520
where things don't match your schema.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.641
(Laughter)

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.840
(Applause)

00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:17.010
So I teach my students a different schema.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.204
If A is the question,

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.385
B is the answer,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.855
stay creative in the cloud,

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:28.830
and you start going,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.193
and experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:33.728
experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:36.404
until you reach a place linked
with negative emotions

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.682
where it seems like your basic assumptions

00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:39.798
have stopped making sense,

00:04:39.798 --> 00:04:42.853
like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.

00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:46.181
And I call this place the cloud.

00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:02.363
Now you can be lost in the cloud

00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:04.871
for a day, a week, a month, a year,

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.369
a whole career,

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.531
but sometimes, if you're lucky enough

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.387
and you have enough support,

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:12.377
you can see in the materials at hand,

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:15.625
or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:17.627
a new answer,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.969
C, and you decide to go for it.

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.338
And experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:26.807
but you get there,

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:28.027
and then you tell everyone about it

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:31.529
by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.488
which is a great way to communicate,

00:05:33.488 --> 00:05:35.832
but as long as you don't forget the path

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:37.631
that brought you there.

00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:39.606
Now this cloud is an inherent part

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.210
of research, an inherent part of our craft,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.420
because the cloud stands guard at the boundary.

00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:51.990
It stands guard at the boundary

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.962
between the known

00:05:57.795 --> 00:06:01.399
and the unknown,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.385
because in order to discover something truly new,

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:10.962
at least one of your basic
assumptions has to change,

00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:12.216
and that means that in science,

00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:14.178
we do something quite heroic.

00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:15.999
Every day, we try to bring ourselves

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.811
to the boundary between
the known and the unknown

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.632
and face the cloud.

00:06:19.632 --> 00:06:21.337
Now notice that I put B

00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:22.080
in the land of the known,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.891
because we knew about it in the beginning,

00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:27.540
but C is always more interesting

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.263
and more important than B.

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:32.456
So B is essential in order to get going,

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:34.274
but C is much more profound,

00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:38.771
and that's the amazing thing about resesarch.

00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:40.959
Now just knowing that word, the cloud,

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:43.514
has been transformational in my research group,

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.384
because students come to me and say,

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:46.982
"Uri, I'm in the cloud,"

00:06:46.982 --> 00:06:50.148
and I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable."

00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:52.290
(Laughter)

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.203
But I'm kind of happy,

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:55.881
because we might be close to the boundary

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.777
between the known and the unknown,

00:06:57.777 --> 00:06:59.323
and we stand a chance of discovering

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:01.184
something truly new,

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:02.526
since the way our mind works,

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:05.674
it's just knowing that the cloud

00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:10.100
is normal, it's essential,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.305
and in fact beautiful,

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:14.928
we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,

00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:16.846
and it detoxifies the feeling that something

00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:19.408
is deeply wrong with me.

00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:21.858
And as a mentor, I know what to do,

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.060
which is to step up my support for the student,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.541
because research in psychology shows

00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:29.100
that if you're feeling fear and despair,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.097
your mind narrows down

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:32.928
to very safe and conservative ways of thinking.

00:07:32.928 --> 00:07:34.503
If you'd like to explore the risky paths

00:07:34.503 --> 00:07:35.891
needed to get out of the cloud,

00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:37.652
you need other emotions --

00:07:37.652 --> 00:07:39.853
solidarity, support, hope —

00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:41.590
that come with your connection from somebody else,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.140
so like in improvisation theater,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.441
in science, it's best to walk into the unknown

00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.410
together.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.852
So knowing about the cloud,

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:53.176
you also learn from improvisation theater

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:55.778
a very effective way to have conversations

00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:57.538
inside the cloud.

00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:59.515
It's based on the central principle

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:01.282
of improvisation theater,

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:02.375
so here improvisation theater

00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.671
came to my help again.

00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.962
It's called saying "Yes, and"

00:08:05.962 --> 00:08:09.427
to the offers made by other actors.

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:19.191
That means accepting the offers

00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:21.702
and building on them, saying, "Yes, and."

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:22.941
For example, if one actor says,

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.096
"Here is a pool of water,"

00:08:24.096 --> 00:08:25.141
and the other actor says,

00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:27.010
"No, that's just a stage,"

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.748
the improvisation is over.

00:08:28.748 --> 00:08:32.520
It's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.868
That's called blocking.

00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:35.475
If you're not mindful of communications,

00:08:35.475 --> 00:08:38.412
scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.

00:08:38.412 --> 00:08:40.648
Saying "Yes, and" sounds like this.

00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:43.156
"Here is a pool of water."
"Yeah, let's jump in."

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:46.165
"Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:48.266
It's pulling us to the moon!"

00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:51.286
So saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:52.980
We all have an inner critic

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.221
that kind of guards what we say,

00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:56.144
so people don't think that we're obscene

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.259
or crazy or unoriginal,

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.519
and science is full of the fear

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:00.076
of appearing unoriginal.

00:09:00.076 --> 00:09:02.243
Saying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic

00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:04.855
and unlocks hidden voices of creativity

00:09:04.855 --> 00:09:06.380
you didn't even know that you had,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.410
and they often carry the answer

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.815
about the cloud.

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:13.416
So you see, knowing about the cloud

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:14.820
and about saying "Yes, and"

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.679
made my lab very creative.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:20.207
Students started playing off of each others' ideas,

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:22.321
and we made surprising discoveries

00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.190
in the interface between physics and biology.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.140
For example, we were stuck for a year

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.289
trying to understand the intricate

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:31.982
biochemical networks inside our cells,

00:09:31.982 --> 00:09:34.439
and we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,"

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.419
and we had a playful conversation

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:38.207
where my student Shai Shen Orr said,

00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:41.050
"Let's just draw this on a
piece of paper, this network,"

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.503
and instead of saying,

00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:44.654
"But we've done that so many times

00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:45.688
and it doesn't work,"

00:09:45.688 --> 00:09:48.631
I said, "Yes, and

00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:50.672
let's use a very big piece of paper,"

00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:51.764
and then Ron Milo said,

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:53.984
"Let's use a gigantic architect's

00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:55.780
blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.280
and we printed out the network and looked at it,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.789
and that's where we made
our most important discovery,

00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:02.990
that this complicated network is just made

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.453
of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns

00:10:06.453 --> 00:10:09.616
like motifs in a stained glass window.

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:11.664
We call them network motifs,

00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:13.816
and they're the elementary circuits

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.201
that help us understand

00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:17.901
the logic of the way cells make decisions

00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:20.750
in all organisms, including our body.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.675
Soon enough, after this,

00:10:22.675 --> 00:10:24.295
I started being invited to give talks

00:10:24.295 --> 00:10:27.306
to thousands of scientists across the world,

00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:29.139
but the knowledge about the cloud

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.271
and saying "Yes, and"

00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:32.110
just stayed within my own lab,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.241
because you see, in science,
we don't talk about the process,

00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:36.674
anything subjective or emotional.

00:10:36.674 --> 00:10:38.537
We talk about the results.

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.606
So there was no way to talk about it in conferences.

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:42.530
That was unthinkable.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.606
And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:46.380
without even having a word to describe

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.701
what they're seeing,

00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:49.056
and their ways of thinking

00:10:49.056 --> 00:10:50.584
narrowed down to very safe paths,

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:52.244
their science didn't reach its full potential,

00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:53.997
and they were miserable.

00:10:53.997 --> 00:10:55.936
I thought, that's the way it is.

00:10:55.936 --> 00:10:57.957
I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.637
and if everybody else does the same,

00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:01.827
science will eventually become

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.041
more and more better and better.

00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.961
That way of thinking got turned on its head

00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:09.300
when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.658
give a talk about her experiences

00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:12.349
as a woman in science.

00:11:12.349 --> 00:11:14.172
And she asked,

00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:16.120
"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.306
and emotional aspects of doing science?

00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:22.298
It's not by chance. It's a matter of values."

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:24.476
You see, science seeks knowledge

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.271
that's objective and rational.

00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:28.469
That's the beautiful thing about science.

00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:30.425
But we also have a cultural myth

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:31.679
that the doing of science,

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:33.979
what we do every day to get that knowledge,

00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:36.419
is also only objective and rational,

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:38.851
like Mr. Spock.

00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:40.265
And when you label something

00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:42.078
as objective and rational,

00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:43.720
automatically, the other side,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.177
the subjective and emotional,

00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:47.279
become labeled as non-science

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.250
or anti-science or threatening to science,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.061
and we just don't talk about it.

00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:53.015
And when I heard that,

00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:55.182
that science has a culture,

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:56.729
everything clicked into place for me,

00:11:56.729 --> 00:11:58.393
because if science has a culture,

00:11:58.393 --> 00:11:59.649
culture can be changed,

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:01.242
and I can be a change agent

00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:03.954
working to change the culture
of science wherever I could.

00:12:03.954 --> 00:12:07.023
And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:08.635
I talked about my science,

00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:10.147
and then I talked about the importance

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:12.329
of the subjective and emotional
aspects of doing science

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:13.449
and how we should talk about them,

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:14.683
and I looked at the audience,

00:12:14.683 --> 00:12:17.043
and they were cold.

00:12:17.043 --> 00:12:20.334
They couldn't hear what I was saying

00:12:20.334 --> 00:12:21.585
in the context of a 10 back-to-back

00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:23.424
PowerPoint presentation conference.

00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:25.906
And I tried again and again,
conference after conference,

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:28.279
but I wasn't getting through.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:31.185
I was in the cloud.

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:34.699
And eventually I managed to get out the cloud

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:37.510
using improvisation and music.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.249
Since then, every conference I go to,

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:43.111
I give a science talk and a second, special talk

00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:45.104
called "Love and fear in the lab,"

00:12:45.104 --> 00:12:47.321
and I start it off by doing a song

00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:49.893
about scientists' greatest fear,

00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:52.805
which is that we work hard,

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.147
we discover something new,

00:12:55.147 --> 00:12:58.504
and somebody else publishes it before we do.

00:12:58.504 --> 00:13:01.120
We call it being scooped,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.334
and being scooped feels horrible.

00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:06.547
It makes us afraid to talk to each other,

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:07.380
which is no fun,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.140
because we came to science to share our ideas

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.451
and to learn from each other,

00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:14.940
and so I do a blues song,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.544
which — (Applause) —

00:13:22.544 --> 00:13:25.767
called "Scooped Again,"

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:28.425
and I ask the audience to be my backup singers,

00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:32.405
and I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"

00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:35.050
It sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!"

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.013
Sounds like this.

00:13:36.013 --> 00:13:38.232
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:39.975
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:39.975 --> 00:13:41.253
And then we go for it.

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:43.298
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:43.298 --> 00:13:44.584
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:44.584 --> 00:13:46.479
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:47.785
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.568
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:49.568 --> 00:13:51.207
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:51.207 --> 00:13:52.875
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.637
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:54.637 --> 00:13:57.912
♪ Oh mama, can't you feel my pain ♪

00:13:57.912 --> 00:14:01.698
♪ Heavens help me, I've been scooped again ♪

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:09.316
(Applause)

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:10.965
Thank you.

00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:12.464
Thank you for your backup singing.

00:14:12.464 --> 00:14:14.548
So everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,

00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:16.560
notices that there's other scientists around them

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.867
with shared issues,

00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.672
and we start talking about the emotional

00:14:19.672 --> 00:14:21.522
and subjective things that go on in research.

00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:23.706
It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.

00:14:23.706 --> 00:14:26.505
Finally, we can talk about
this in a scientific conference.

00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:28.691
And scientists have gone on to form peer groups

00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:30.301
where they meet regularly

00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:31.930
and create a space to talk about the emotional

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.231
and subjective things that
happen as they're mentoring,

00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:35.594
as they're going into the unknown,

00:14:35.594 --> 00:14:37.164
and even started courses

00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:38.839
about the process of doing science,

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:40.734
about going into the unknown together,

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:42.150
and many other things.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.484
So my vision is that,

00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:46.946
just like every scientist knows the word "atom,"

00:14:46.946 --> 00:14:48.913
that matter is made out of atoms,

00:14:48.913 --> 00:14:50.397
every scientist would know the words

00:14:50.397 --> 00:14:52.741
like "the cloud," saying "Yes, and,"

00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:55.820
and science will become much more creative,

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.824
make many, many more unexpected discoveries

00:14:58.824 --> 00:15:01.360
for the benefit of us all,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.576
and would also be much more playful.

00:15:03.576 --> 00:15:06.166
And what I might ask you to remember from this talk

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.862
is that next time you face

00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:10.588
a problem you can't solve

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:13.180
in work or in life,

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.056
there's a word for what you're going to see:

00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:16.233
the cloud.

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:17.766
And you can go through the cloud

00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:19.174
not alone but together

00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:21.212
with someone who is your source of support

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.260
to say "Yes, and" to your ideas,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.577
to help you say "Yes, and" to your own ideas,

00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:27.464
to increase the chance that,

00:15:27.464 --> 00:15:29.190
through the wisps of the cloud,

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.688
you'll find that moment of calmness

00:15:30.688 --> 00:15:32.491
where you get your first glimpse

00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:35.741
of your unexpected discovery,

00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:38.465
your C.

00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:40.785
Thank you.

00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:44.785
(Applause)
