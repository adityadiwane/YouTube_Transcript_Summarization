00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:14.715
Last year,

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.246
three of my family members
were gruesomely murdered

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.713
in a hate crime.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.428
It goes without saying
that it's really difficult

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.175
for me to be here today,

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.782
but my brother Deah,

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:27.222
his wife Yusor,

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.777
and her sister Razan

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.510
don't give me much of a choice.

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:34.663
I'm hopeful that by the end
of this talk you will make a choice,

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:37.130
and join me in standing up against hate.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.746
It's December 27, 2014:

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.002
the morning of my brother's wedding day.

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:46.090
He asks me to come over and comb his hair

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:48.254
in preparation
for his wedding photo shoot.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:53.947
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball,
particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.874
(Laughter)

00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:00.830
An American kid in dental school
ready to take on the world.

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:04.482
When Deah and Yusor
have their first dance,

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:06.312
I see the love in his eyes,

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:07.966
her reciprocated joy,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.277
and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.945
I move to the back of the hall
and burst into tears.

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:16.545
And the second the song finishes playing,

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:17.756
he beelines towards me,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.031
buries me into his arms

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:20.475
and rocks me back and forth.

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:22.123
Even in that moment,

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.024
when everything was so distracting,

00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:25.901
he was attuned to me.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.756
He cups my face and says,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.960
"Suzanne,

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:31.268
I am who I am because of you.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.843
Thank you for everything.

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.038
I love you."

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.663
About a month later, I'm back home
in North Carolina for a short visit,

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:45.398
and on the last evening,
I run upstairs to Deah's room,

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:48.717
eager to find out how he's feeling
being a newly married man.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.042
With a big boyish smile he says,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.780
"I'm so happy. I love her.
She's an amazing girl."

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:56.438
And she is.

00:01:56.902 --> 00:01:59.840
At just 21, she'd recently
been accepted to join Deah

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:01.439
at UNC dental school.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:05.249
She shared his love for basketball,
and at her urging,

00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:09.196
they started their honeymoon off
attending their favorite team of the NBA,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.625
the LA Lakers.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.401
I mean, check out that form.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:15.652
(Laughter)

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.004
I'll never forget that moment
sitting there with him --

00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:24.528
how free he was in his happiness.

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:27.017
My littler brother,
a basketball-obsessed kid,

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.847
had become and transformed
into an accomplished young man.

00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:33.599
He was at the top
of his dental school class,

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:35.200
and alongside Yusor and Razan,

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:39.440
was involved in local and international
community service projects

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:41.793
dedicated to the homeless and refugees,

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:44.104
including a dental relief trip
they were planning

00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:46.026
for Syrian refugees in Turkey.

00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:48.796
Razan, at just 19,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.974
used her creativity
as an architectural engineering student

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:53.689
to serve those around her,

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:55.960
making care packages
for the local homeless,

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:57.650
among other projects.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:02:59.631
That is who they were.

00:03:01.423 --> 00:03:02.663
Standing there that night,

00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.628
I take a deep breath
and look at Deah and tell him,

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:09.141
"I have never been more proud of you
than I am in this moment."

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.380
He pulls me into his tall frame,

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:12.567
hugs me goodnight,

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.821
and I leave the next morning
without waking him

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:16.285
to go back to San Francisco.

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.245
That is the last time I ever hug him.

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:25.615
Ten days later, I'm on call
at San Francisco General Hospital

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.485
when I receive a barrage of vague
text messages expressing condolences.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.317
Confused, I call my father,
who calmly intones,

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:35.342
"There's been a shooting
in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:37.358
It's on lock-down. That's all we know."

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.822
I hang up and quickly Google,
"shooting in Chapel Hill."

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.877
One hit comes up.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.323
Quote:

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:46.608
"Three people were shot
in the back of the head

00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:48.376
and confirmed dead on the scene."

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.466
Something in me just knows.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.610
I fling out of my chair and faint
onto the gritty hospital floor,

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:54.884
wailing.

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.757
I take the first red-eye
out of San Francisco,

00:03:57.781 --> 00:03:59.018
numb and disoriented.

00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:02.948
I walk into my childhood home
and faint into my parents' arms,

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.154
sobbing.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:07.096
I then run up to Deah's room
as I did so many times before,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.168
just looking for him,

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:11.785
only to find a void
that will never be filled.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.006
Investigation and autopsy reports
eventually revealed

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.549
the sequence of events.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.776
Deah had just gotten
off the bus from class,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.379
Razan was visiting for dinner,

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:27.978
already at home with Yusor.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.384
As they began to eat,
they heard a knock on the door.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:33.436
When Deah opened it,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.211
their neighbor proceeded
to fire multiple shots at him.

00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:40.317
According to 911 calls,

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.378
the girls were heard screaming.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:47.173
The man turned towards the kitchen
and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,

00:04:47.197 --> 00:04:48.347
immobilizing her.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.139
He then approached her from behind,

00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:52.408
pressed the barrel of his gun
against her head,

00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:55.147
and with a single bullet,
lacerated her midbrain.

00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:59.454
He then turned towards Razan,
who was screaming for her life,

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:01.640
and, execution-style, with a single bullet

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:05.368
to the back of the head,

00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:06.572
killed her.

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:08.905
On his way out,

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.206
he shot Deah one last time --
a bullet in the mouth --

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.081
for a total of eight bullets:

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.959
two lodged in the head,

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.494
two in his chest

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:19.548
and the rest in his extremities.

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.662
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed

00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:27.044
in a place that was meant
to be safe: their home.

00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:30.315
For months, this man
had been harassing them:

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.744
knocking on their door,

00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:34.200
brandishing his gun
on a couple of occasions.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.624
His Facebook was cluttered
with anti-religion posts.

00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:40.950
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.

00:05:41.947 --> 00:05:43.471
As she was moving in,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.998
he told Yusor and her mom
that he didn't like the way they looked.

00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:52.281
In response, Yusor's mom told her
to be kind to her neighbor,

00:05:52.305 --> 00:05:53.662
that as he got to know them,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.429
he'd see them for who they were.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.796
I guess we've all become
so numb to the hatred

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.355
that we couldn't have ever imagined
it turning into fatal violence.

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:08.656
The man who murdered my brother
turned himself in to the police

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.492
shortly after the murders,

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:12.746
saying he killed three kids,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.317
execution-style,

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.066
over a parking dispute.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:20.204
The police issued a premature
public statement that morning,

00:06:20.228 --> 00:06:22.672
echoing his claims
without bothering to question it

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:24.147
or further investigate.

00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:27.750
It turns out there was no parking dispute.

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:29.380
There was no argument.

00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:30.682
No violation.

00:06:31.197 --> 00:06:32.852
But the damage was already done.

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:35.382
In a 24-hour media cycle,

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:38.843
the words "parking dispute" had already
become the go-to sound bite.

00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:44.173
I sit on my brother's bed
and remember his words,

00:06:44.763 --> 00:06:48.002
the words he gave me
so freely and with so much love,

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:50.257
"I am who I am because of you."

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.956
That's what it takes for me
to climb through my crippling grief

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.137
and speak out.

00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:57.943
I cannot let my family's deaths
be diminished to a segment

00:06:57.967 --> 00:07:00.065
that is barely discussed on local news.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.159
They were murdered by their neighbor
because of their faith,

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:07.641
because of a piece of cloth
they chose to don on their heads,

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.658
because they were visibly Muslim.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.419
Some of the rage I felt at the time

00:07:15.443 --> 00:07:17.364
was that if roles were reversed,

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:21.203
and an Arab, Muslim
or Muslim-appearing person

00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:26.081
had killed three white American
college students execution-style,

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.261
in their home,

00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:28.779
what would we have called it?

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:31.492
A terrorist attack.

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:35.475
When white men commit
acts of violence in the US,

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:36.719
they're lone wolves,

00:07:36.743 --> 00:07:37.933
mentally ill

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.781
or driven by a parking dispute.

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:45.911
I know that I have to give
my family voice,

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:48.131
and I do the only thing I know how:

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:50.970
I send a Facebook message
to everyone I know in media.

00:07:53.253 --> 00:07:54.704
A couple of hours later,

00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:58.522
in the midst of a chaotic house
overflowing with friends and family,

00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:01.596
our neighbor Neal comes over,
sits down next to my parents

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.749
and asks, "What can I do?"

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:08.535
Neal had over two decades
of experience in journalism,

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:11.964
but he makes it clear that he's not
there in his capacity as journalist,

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:13.841
but as a neighbor who wants to help.

00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:16.208
I ask him what he thinks we should do,

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:19.286
given the bombardment
of local media interview requests.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.122
He offers to set up a press conference
at a local community center.

00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:27.867
Even now I don't have
the words to thank him.

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:32.345
"Just tell me when, and I'll have
all the news channels present," he said.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.138
He did for us what we
could not do for ourselves

00:08:35.162 --> 00:08:36.814
in a moment of devastation.

00:08:37.737 --> 00:08:39.332
I delivered the press statement,

00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:41.483
still wearing scrubs
from the previous night.

00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:43.518
And in under 24 hours from the murders,

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:46.291
I'm on CNN being interviewed
by Anderson Cooper.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.902
The following day, major newspapers --

00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:51.677
including the New York Times,
Chicago Tribune --

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.332
published stories about Deah,
Yusor and Razan,

00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.531
allowing us to reclaim the narrative

00:08:56.555 --> 00:09:00.048
and call attention the mainstreaming
of anti-Muslim hatred.

00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:04.491
These days,

00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:09.095
it feels like Islamophobia
is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.

00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:12.299
We just have to put up with it and smile.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.503
The nasty stares,

00:09:14.527 --> 00:09:16.930
the palpable fear when boarding a plane,

00:09:16.954 --> 00:09:21.250
the random pat downs at airports
that happen 99 percent of the time.

00:09:22.148 --> 00:09:23.495
It doesn't stop there.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:28.264
We have politicians reaping political
and financial gains off our backs.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:29.448
Here in the US,

00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:31.839
we have presidential candidates
like Donald Trump,

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.266
casually calling to register
American Muslims,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.725
and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees
from entering this country.

00:09:38.353 --> 00:09:41.077
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise

00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.590
in parallel with election cycles.

00:09:46.748 --> 00:09:49.032
Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:50.856
a Lebanese-American Christian,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.636
was murdered in Oklahoma
by his neighbor --

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.910
a man who called him a "filthy Arab."

00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:59.338
This man was previously jailed
for a mere 8 months,

00:09:59.362 --> 00:10:02.485
after attempting run over
Khalid's mother with his car.

00:10:03.627 --> 00:10:06.481
Chances are you haven't heard
Khalid's story,

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.860
because it didn't make it
to national news.

00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:12.005
The least we can do is call it what it is:

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.345
a hate crime.

00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:15.607
The least we can do is talk about it,

00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:19.563
because violence and hatred
doesn't just happen in a vacuum.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.454
Not long after coming back to work,

00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:27.456
I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.096
when one of my patients
looks over at my colleague,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.673
gestures around her face
and says, "San Bernardino,"

00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:35.674
referencing a recent terrorist attack.

00:10:36.596 --> 00:10:40.160
Here I am having just lost three
family members to Islamophobia,

00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:42.356
having been a vocal advocate
within my program

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.607
on how to deal with such microaggressions,

00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:45.790
and yet --

00:10:45.814 --> 00:10:46.976
silence.

00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:48.801
I was disheartened.

00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:50.539
Humiliated.

00:10:51.413 --> 00:10:53.348
Days later rounding on the same patient,

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:54.688
she looks at me and says,

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:57.802
"Your people are killing
people in Los Angeles."

00:10:59.216 --> 00:11:01.279
I look around expectantly.

00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:02.624
Again:

00:11:02.648 --> 00:11:03.848
silence.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:06.595
I realize that yet again,

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:08.394
I have to speak up for myself.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.284
I sit on her bed and gently ask her,

00:11:12.308 --> 00:11:16.277
"Have I ever done anything
but treat you with respect and kindness?

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:20.581
Have I done anything but give
you compassionate care?"

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:23.578
She looks down and realizes
what she said was wrong,

00:11:23.602 --> 00:11:25.337
and in front of the entire team,

00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:26.877
she apologizes and says,

00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:29.487
"I should know better.
I'm Mexican-American.

00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:31.943
I receive this kind
of treatment all the time."

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:38.618
Many of us experience
microaggressions on a daily basis.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:41.501
Odds are you may have experienced it,

00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:42.924
whether for your race,

00:11:42.948 --> 00:11:44.099
gender,

00:11:44.123 --> 00:11:45.274
sexuality

00:11:45.298 --> 00:11:46.707
or religious beliefs.

00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:49.864
We've all been in situations
where we've witnessed something wrong

00:11:49.888 --> 00:11:51.148
and didn't speak up.

00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:54.829
Maybe we weren't equipped
with the tools to respond in the moment.

00:11:54.853 --> 00:11:58.289
Maybe we weren't even aware
of our own implicit biases.

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:02.585
We can all agree that bigotry
is unacceptable,

00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:03.814
but when we see it,

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:05.005
we're silent,

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:06.810
because it makes us uncomfortable.

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:09.988
But stepping right into that discomfort

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.580
means you are also stepping
into the ally zone.

00:12:13.472 --> 00:12:16.648
There may be over three million
Muslims in America.

00:12:16.672 --> 00:12:19.747
That's still just one percent
of the total population.

00:12:20.966 --> 00:12:22.567
Martin Luther King once said,

00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:23.931
"In the end,

00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:26.461
we will remember not
the words of our enemies,

00:12:27.098 --> 00:12:29.239
but the silence of our friends."

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.688
So what made my neighbor
Neal's allyship so profound?

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:38.633
A couple of things.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.327
He was there as a neighbor who cared,

00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:44.543
but he was also bringing in
his professional expertise and resources

00:12:44.567 --> 00:12:46.110
when the moment called for it.

00:12:46.926 --> 00:12:48.548
Others have done the same.

00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:51.574
Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform

00:12:51.598 --> 00:12:55.086
as the first tenured African-American
professor at Wheaton College

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.764
to wear a hijab in solidarity

00:12:56.788 --> 00:12:59.614
with Muslim women who face
discrimination every day.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.483
As a result, she lost her job.

00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:04.971
Within a month,

00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:07.518
she joined the faculty
at the University of Virginia,

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:11.183
where she now works on pluralism,
race, faith and culture.

00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:14.922
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,

00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:18.674
demonstrated that not all active
allyship needs to be so serious.

00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:21.933
He stepped up to support
a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission

00:13:21.957 --> 00:13:24.004
to introduce a hijab emoji.

00:13:24.028 --> 00:13:25.541
(Laughter)

00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:27.624
It's a simple gesture,

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.185
but it has a significant
subconscious impact

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.448
on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,

00:13:33.472 --> 00:13:36.117
including the community
as a part of an "us"

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.825
instead of an "other."

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.669
The editor in chief
of Women's Running magazine

00:13:41.693 --> 00:13:45.780
just put the first hijabi to ever be
on the cover of a US fitness magazine.

00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:48.763
These are all very different examples

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.742
of people who drew upon
their platforms and resources

00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:54.099
in academia, tech and media,

00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:56.312
to actively express their allyship.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.690
What resources and expertise
do you bring to the table?

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:03.665
Are you willing to step
into your discomfort

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.201
and speak up when you witness
hateful bigotry?

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.173
Will you be Neal?

00:14:09.258 --> 00:14:11.552
Many neighbors appeared in this story.

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:15.344
And you, in your respective communities,
all have a Muslim neighbor,

00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:16.521
colleague

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:18.876
or friend your child plays with at school.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.368
Reach out to them.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.968
Let them know you stand
with them in solidarity.

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:24.724
It may feel really small,

00:14:24.748 --> 00:14:27.543
but I promise you it makes a difference.

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:33.117
Nothing will ever bring back
Deah, Yusor and Razan.

00:14:33.723 --> 00:14:36.070
But when we raise our collective voices,

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:37.809
that is when we stop the hate.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.512
Thank you.

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:47.833
(Applause)
