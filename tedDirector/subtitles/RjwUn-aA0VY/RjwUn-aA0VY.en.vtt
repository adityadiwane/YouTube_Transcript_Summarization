00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
This is a guy named Bob McKim.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.160
He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and also led the Stanford Design Program.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.160
who’s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And he liked to do an exercise with his students

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
where he got them to take a piece of paper

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
very quickly, just as quickly as they could.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.160
I need you to turn that piece of paper over;

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
you should find that it’s blank on the other side.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And there should be a pencil.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.160
and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.160
So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Come on: those masterpieces ...

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
OK? Stop. All right, now.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
(Laughter)

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Yes, lot’s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
(Laughter)

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Am I hearing a few "sorry’s"? I think I’m hearing a few sorry’s.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Yup, yup, I think I probably am.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And that’s exactly what happens every time,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
every time you do this with adults.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
McKim found this every time he did it with his students.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry’s.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
(Laughter)

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And he would point this out as evidence

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
that we fear the judgment of our peers,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
to people we think of as our peers, to those around us.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
And this fear is what causes us

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
to be conservative in our thinking.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
So we might have a wild idea,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
they have no embarrassment at all.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
They just quite happily show their masterpiece

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.160
to whoever wants to look at it.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
But as they learn to become adults,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160
and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
And in studies of kids playing, it’s been shown

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
time after time that kids who feel secure,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
who are in a kind of trusted environment --

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160
they’re the ones that feel most free to play.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And if you’re starting a design firm, let’s say,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
then you probably also want to create

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
a place where people have the same kind of security.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Where they have the same kind of security to take risks.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Maybe have the same kind of security to play.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Before founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.160
was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.160
He knew that friendship is a short cut to play.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
that we need to take as designers.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And so, that decision to work with his friends --

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.160
now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
are designed to help people feel relaxed:

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
familiar with their surroundings,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
comfortable with the people that they’re working with.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
that remind people to be playful,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
and that it’s a permissive environment.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
So, whether it’s this microbus meeting room

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
that we have in one our buildings at IDEO;

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.160
or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
or at the Googleplex, where

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
but anyway, they’re there in the garden.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Or even in the Swiss office of Google,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
So all of these places have these symbols.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
not so much the place, it’s a thing.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
or created a few years ago.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And I forgot to bring one up with me.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
you’ll find something taped underneath it.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
has got one taped under your chair.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
But before we start, I need just to put these on.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Thank you. All right.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how --

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160
I can’t see out of these, OK.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
I’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
can actually get those things onto the stage.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
So the way they work is, you know,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
you just put your finger in the thing,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
pull them back, and off you go.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.160
So, don’t look backwards. That’s my only recommendation here.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
So come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
I have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
(Laughter)

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160
There we go.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
(Laughter)

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
(Laughter)

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Well, they’re still coming in from the back there;

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.160
they’re still coming in.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
Can you not figure out how to do it, or something?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
It’s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
in the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better...

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160
I'd better clear these up out of the way;

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
otherwise, I’m going to trip over them.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
All right. So the rest of you can save them

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
for when I say something particularly boring,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.160
and then you can fire at me.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
(Laughter)

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
All right. I think I’m going to take these off now,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
So, ah, that was fun.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
(Laughter)

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
All right, good.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
(Applause)

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
So, OK, so why?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
Why do we have them? Well, as I said,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
But why is it important?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.160
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Helps us do our jobs better,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
and helps us feel better when we do them.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Now, an adult encountering a new situation --

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.160
And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Life’s complicated; we want to figure out

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
what’s going on around us very quickly.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
to categorize new things very, very quickly.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
One of them might be, you know,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.160
when we see this funny stripy thing:

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
We need to figure that out pretty fast.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Well, at least, we did once.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
Well, not necessarily.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
(Laughter)

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?"

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Of course they will. But they’ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And you know, the more creative of them

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
might get to a really interesting example.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.160
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
We’ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
our kids end up playing with the boxes

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
far more than they play with the toys that are inside them.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
And you know, from an exploration perspective,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
this behavior makes complete sense.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Even one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo --

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
which, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:47.160
whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
So again, this is another one of those playful activities

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160
is called the "30 Circles Test."

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
So we’re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
back over, and you’ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to give you minute,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
into objects of some form.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
So for example, you could turn one into a football,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
or another one into a sun. All I’m interested in is quantity.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
I want you to do as many of them as you can,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
in the minute that I’m just about to give you.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
So, who got more than five circles figured out?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
Keep your hands up if you did 10.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.160
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
I wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.160
And one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160
We stop ourselves from doing things.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
We self-edit as we’re having ideas.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.160
And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.160
And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.160
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
even if they don’t seem that different from each other,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.160
is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
So now, Bob McKim did another

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
version of this test

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Anybody know what this is? It’s the peyote cactus.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
It’s the plant from which you can create mescaline,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
one of the psychedelic drugs.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160
For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.160
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160
that he and his colleagues conducted

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.160
to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:33.160
So he picked 27 professionals -- they were

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
furniture designers even, artists --

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
and he asked them to come along one evening,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:48.160
and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
He gave each of them some mescaline,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And then he did what’s called the Purdue Creativity Test.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160
It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and after the drugs, to see

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
what the difference was in people’s

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
facility and speed with coming up with ideas.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
And then he asked them to go away

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.160
and work on those problems that they’d brought.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
And they’d come up with a bunch of

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
interesting solutions -- and actually, quite

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
And so, some of the things that they figured out,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
some of these individuals figured out;

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160
that were accepted by clients;

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
a design of a solar space probe experiment;

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
you can tell this is a while ago;

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
the completion of a line of furniture;

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and even a new conceptual model of the photon.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
So it was a pretty successful evening.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160
In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
got off to its great start with innovation.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160
We don’t know, but it may be.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160
We need to ask some of the CEOs

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important;

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160
it was this idea that what the drugs did

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and getting them to forget the adult behaviors

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
that were getting in the way of their ideas.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Edicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity."

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160
And somehow that seems wrong.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
I mean, can you have rules about creativity?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
to help us break the old rules and norms

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
that otherwise we might bring to the creative process.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And we’ve certainly learnt that over time,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
you get much better brainstorming,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.160
much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
achieve this is in a much more organic way.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
And they experimented with plywood for many years

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
without necessarily having one single goal in mind.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
They were exploring following what was interesting to them.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
and from this experiment they moved on to chairs.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Through constant experimentation with materials,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
they developed a wide range of iconic solutions

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
that we know today, eventually resulting in,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
of course, the legendary lounge chair.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
then we wouldn’t be the beneficiaries of so many

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
wonderful designs today.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.160
And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.160
from films to buildings, from games to graphics.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
So, they’re great examples, I think, of exploration

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
and experimentation in design.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160
Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160
they were also exploring physical objects.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
And they were doing that through building prototypes.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.160
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
So the average Western first-grader

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
spends as much as 50 percent of their play time

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
taking part in what’s called "construction play."

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
but also a powerful way to learn.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.160
When play is about building a tower out of blocks,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
the kid begins to learn a lot about towers.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.160
learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160
It’s classically learning by doing.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160
Now, David Kelley calls this behavior,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
when it’s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands."

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
And it typically involves making multiple,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
low-resolution prototypes very quickly,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160
often by bringing lots of found elements together

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160
in order to get to a solution.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160
On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.160
and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.160
So, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
Another example is a group of designers

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
about what it was they needed with this device.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
And one of the designers ran out of the room

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister --

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium --

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.160
and a clothespin. He taped them all together,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.160
ran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?"

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
well, I want to hold it like this, or like that.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
And all of a sudden a productive conversation

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.160
was happening about design around a tangible object.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.160
And in the end it turned into a real device.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.160
into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
sometimes about the environment.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff --

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.160
But the important idea is that everything’s at hand, everything’s around.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
So when designers are working on ideas,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
they can start building stuff whenever they want.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.160
They don’t necessarily even have to go

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
into some kind of formal workshop to do it.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
And we think that’s pretty important.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
And then the sad thing is, although preschools

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
are full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
it all gets taken away.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
They lose this stuff that facilitates

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.160
this sort of playful and building mode of thinking.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.160
And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
maybe the best construction tool we have

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
might be the Post-it notes. It’s pretty barren.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
But by giving project teams and the clients

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
who they’re working with permission to think with their hands,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.160
quite complex ideas can spring into life

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.160
and go right through to execution much more easily.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
explaining what she wants out of a portable information system

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.160
to a team of technologists and designers

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
that are working with her in a hospital.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160
And just having this very simple prototype

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.160
allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160
And of course, by building quick prototypes,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.160
we can get out and test our ideas with consumers

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160
and users much more quickly

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.160
than if we’re trying to describe them through words.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
But what about designing something that isn’t physical?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
Something like a service or an experience?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.160
Something that exists as a series of interactions over time?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.160
Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160
So, if you’re designing an interaction between two people --

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.160
such as, I don’t know -- ordering food at a fast food joint

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160
or something, you need to be able to imagine

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.160
how that experience might feel over a period of time.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
And I think the best way to achieve that,

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.160
and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160
trying to convince our clients of this.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
They can be a little skeptical; I’ll come back to that.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.160
But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.160
is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems --

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.160
things like education or security or finance or health.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
And this is another example in a healthcare environment

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
of some doctors and some nurses and designers

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.160
acting out a service scenario around patient care.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160
But you know, many adults

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.160
are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.160
Some of it’s embarrassment and some of it is because

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.160
they just don’t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.160
you know, "That’s just happening because they’re acting it out."

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
Research into kids' behavior actually suggests

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160
Because when children play a role,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.160
they actually follow social scripts quite closely

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160
that they’ve learnt from us as adults.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.160
If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house,"

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.160
then the whole kind of play falls down.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.160
So they get used to quite quickly

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.160
to understanding the rules for social interactions,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.160
and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.160
So when, as adults, we role-play,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.160
then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.160
We’ve gone through lots of experiences in life,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.160
and they provide a strong intuition

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.160
as to whether an interaction is going to work.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160
So we’re very good, when acting out a solution,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.160
at spotting whether something lacks authenticity.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160
So role-play is actually, I think,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.160
quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.160
Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.160
is to put ourselves through an experience which we’re designing for,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.160
and project ourselves into an experience.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160
So here are some designers who are trying to understand

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
what it might feel like to sleep in a

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
confined space on an airplane.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.160
and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.160
if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.160
This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.160
and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.160
Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
One of the reasons he chose to take

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160
this rather large video camera with him was

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160
he was actually sick, and sticking something into him

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.160
that he was going to regret later.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.160
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.160
and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
Because when we looked at the video when he got back,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160
we saw 20 minutes of this.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.160
(Laughter)

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.160
And also, the amazing thing about this video --

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
as soon as you see it you immediately

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.160
project yourself into that experience.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.160
And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.160
while you’re left out in the hallway

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.160
while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.160
in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
And so this notion of using role-play --

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.160
or in this case, living through the experience

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160
as a way of creating empathy --

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.160
particularly when you use video, is really powerful.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160
Or another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.160
he’s here having his chest waxed, not because he’s very vain,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
although actually he is -- no, I’m kidding --

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.160
but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
go through when they’re having dressings removed.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160
And so sometimes these analogous experiences,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.160
analogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.160
So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160
he’s beginning to try on that identity.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.160
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.160
We’re doing the same thing as designers.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.160
We’re trying on these experiences.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.160
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.160
as well as a tool for prototyping experiences.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.160
And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.160
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.160
but also because of their willingness to explore

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.160
and their ability to unselfconsciously

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.160
surrender themselves to the experience.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.160
In short, we admire their willingness to play.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:27.160
Playful exploration, playful building and role-play:

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.160
those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.160
And so far, I admit, this might feel

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.160
like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.160
And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.160
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.160
Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.160
When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.160
they’re following a script that they’ve agreed to.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.160
And it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160
So, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.160
The kind of little face, the portrait you did?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.160
Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160
while you were drinking in a pub.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.160
But everybody agreed to play a game

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160
where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.160
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160
difficult situation into a fun game.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.160
As a result, we’d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time --

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.160
but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.160
But there aren’t just rules about how to play;

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.160
there are rules about when to play.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.160
Kids don’t play all the time, obviously.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160
They transition in and out of it,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.160
and good teachers spend a lot of time

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.160
thinking about how to move kids through these experiences.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.160
As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.160
And if we’re running design studios

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.160
we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.160
designers through these different experiences?

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160
I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of --

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.160
I think what’s very different about design

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.160
is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.160
We go through a sort of generative mode,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160
where we’re exploring many ideas;

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.160
and then we come back together again,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.160
and come back looking for that solution,

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160
and developing that solution.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.160
I think they’re two quite different modes:

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160
divergence and convergence.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.160
And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.160
that we most need playfulness.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.160
Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.160
And so being able to move between those modes

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.160
is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.160
more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.160
Because it’s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.160
You’re either playful or you’re serious, and you can’t be both.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.160
But that’s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.160
and, at times, be playful.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.160
It’s not an either/or; it’s an "and."

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.160
You can be serious and play.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:17.160
So to sum it up, we need trust to play,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.160
and we need trust to be creative. So, there’s a connection.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.160
And there are a series of behaviors that we’ve learnt as kids,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.160
and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.160
They include exploration, which is about going for quantity;

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.160
building, and thinking with your hands;

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.160
and role-play, where acting it out helps us both

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.160
to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.160
and to create services and experiences

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.160
that are seamless and authentic.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160
Thank you very much. (Applause)
