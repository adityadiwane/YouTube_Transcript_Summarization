00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So since I was here last in '06,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
we discovered that global climate change

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
so we covered that fairly extensively

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in Skeptic magazine.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We investigate all kinds

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
because the world's going to end in 2012.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Another update:

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
You will recall I introduced you guys

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
to the Quadro Tracker.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
It's like a water dowsing device.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And you walk around, and it points to things.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
it'll point right to somebody.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
This particular one that was given to me

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
finds golf balls,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
especially if you're at a golf course

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and you check under enough bushes.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
this device, the ADE 651,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
was sold to the Iraqi government

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
for 40,000 dollars apiece.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
It's just like this one, completely worthless,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
magnetic ion attraction,"

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
which translates to

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but it does absolutely nothing.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
In this case, at trespass points,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
allowing people to go through

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
because your little tracker device said they were okay,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
actually cost lives.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in believing in this sort of thing.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So what I want to talk about today is belief.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I want to believe,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and you do too.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
belief is the natural state of things.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
It is the default option. We just believe.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
We believe all sorts of things.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Belief is natural;

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It's more difficult.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and the reason for that is because

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
we have a belief engine in our brains.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And sometimes A really is connected to B,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and that's called association learning.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
We find patterns, we make those connections,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
whether it's Pavlov's dog here

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
associating the sound of the bell with the food,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
in which he's having an association

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
between his behavior and a reward for it,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and therefore he repeats the behavior.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
In fact, what Skinner discovered

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and he has to press one of these two keys,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
if you just randomly assign rewards

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
such that there is no pattern,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
they will figure out any kind of pattern.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
they repeat that particular pattern.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
once clockwise and peck the key twice.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And that's called superstition,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and that, I'm afraid,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
we will always have with us.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I call this process "patternicity" --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
A Type I error, or false positive,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is believing a pattern is real

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
when it's not.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Our second type of error is a false negative.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
A Type II error is not believing

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
a pattern is real when it is.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So let's do a thought experiment.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
You are a hominid three million years ago

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
walking on the plains of Africa.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Your name is Lucy, okay?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And you hear a rustle in the grass.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Is it a dangerous predator,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
or is it just the wind?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and it turns out it's just the wind,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
you've made an error in cognition,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
made a Type I error, false positive.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
But no harm. You just move away.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
you're lunch.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
You've just won a Darwin award.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
You've been taken out of the gene pool.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Now the problem here is that

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
patternicities will occur whenever the cost

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
of making a Type I error

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
We have a pattern detection problem

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is highly problematic,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So the default position

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is just: Believe all patterns are real --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and not just the wind.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And so I think that we evolved ...

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
our pattern-seeking brain processes,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
to always find meaningful patterns

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and infuse them with these sort of

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
So for example, what do you see here?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
It's a horse head, that's right.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
That's a pattern.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And is it really a horse?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Or is it more like a frog?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
See, our pattern detection device,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
it's our little detection device there --

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
For example, what do you see here?

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Yes, of course, it's a cow.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
once I prime the brain to see it,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And what do you see here?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
So when I go back without the prime,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
your brain already has the model

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
so you can see it again.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
What do you see here?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
How about here?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Just shout out anything you see.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
That's a good audience, Chris.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
at U.T. Austin

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
on corporate environments

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
makes people see illusory patterns.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
are more likely to see something in this,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
which is allegedly patternless.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
goes up when there's a lack of control.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
when they're batting,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
but not so much when they're fielding.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Because fielders are successful

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
90 to 95 percent of the time.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So their superstitions, their patternicities,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
are all associated with feelings of lack of control

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and so forth.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Anybody see an object there?

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
There actually is something here,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
but it's degraded.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
While you're thinking about that,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
a psychologist in England,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
who showed subjects this degraded image

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and then ran a correlation between

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
their scores on an ESP test:

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
How much did they believe in the paranormal,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
supernatural, angels and so forth.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
tended to not only see

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
more patterns in the degraded images

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
but incorrect patterns.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Here is what you show subjects.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and then the one I showed you,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
70 percent.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
named Peter Brugger,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
who found significantly more meaningful patterns

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
were perceived on the right hemisphere,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So if you present subjects the images such

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
then they're more likely to see patterns

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Our right hemisphere appears to be

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
to see where all this happens.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
gave subjects L-DOPA.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
L-DOPA increases dopamine.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
An increase of dopamine caused

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
subjects to see more patterns

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
than those that did not receive the dopamine.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So dopamine appears to be the drug

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
associated with patternicity.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
In fact, neuroleptic drugs

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
things like paranoia, delusions

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and hallucinations,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
these are patternicities.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And if you give them drugs

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that are dopamine antagonists,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
they go away.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and their tendency to see

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
patterns like that decreases.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
are dopamine agonists.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
They increase the amount of dopamine.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
creativity, find more patterns.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
talk about how he thought he was much funnier

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So perhaps more dopamine

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
is related to more creativity.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Dopamine, I think, changes

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
our signal-to-noise ratio.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
That is, how accurate we are

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
in finding patterns.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
You think people are talking about you.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
labeled as madness.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
It's a distinction perhaps we might make

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and John Nash.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
One sees maybe just the right number

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And we then call that schizophrenia.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And of course you all know exactly

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
what this is, right?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And what pattern do you see here?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
causing you conflicting pattern detections.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
These are sandals.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Maybe a little Photoshopped.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And of course, the ambiguous figures

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
influences what you

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
tend to see.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And you see the lamp here, I know.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Because the lights on here.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
is, of course, the dolphins, right?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
You see a dolphin here,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and there's a dolphin,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and there's a dolphin.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
(Laughter)

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
If we can give you conflicting data, again,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And then we have to flip the image

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
for you to see that it's a set up.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
The impossible crate illusion.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
in which Jerry is standing inside

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
the impossible crate.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And he was kind enough to post this

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and give us the reveal.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
But even when I take it away,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
to find those certain kinds of patterns.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
This is a fairly new one

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
of comparing this angle with that angle.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
So what you're doing is comparing that angle

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
instead of with this one, but with that one.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And so your brain is fooled.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Faces are easy to see

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
because we have an additional evolved

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
facial recognition software

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
in our temporal lobes.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
But anyway, the point is still made.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Now which one of these looks odd to you?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
so it'll be the one on the right.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
And you are correct.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Well, why is this happening?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Well, we know exactly where it happens,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And there's two types of cells that do this,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
that record facial features either globally,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
first look at the general face.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So you recognize Obama immediately.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And then you notice something quite

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
Especially when they're upside down,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Now I said back in our little thought experiment,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
What's the difference between those?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Well, the wind is inanimate;

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And I call this process agenticity.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
That is the tendency to infuse patterns

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
with meaning, intention and agency,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
often invisible beings from the top down.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
This is an idea that we got

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
who talked about taking the intentional stance.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
aliens, intelligent designers,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
government conspiracists

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and all manner of invisible agents

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
with power and intention, are believed

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to haunt our world and control our lives.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
I think it's the basis of animism

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and polytheism and monotheism.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
It's the belief that aliens are somehow

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
more advanced than us, more moral than us,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and the narratives always are

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
The intelligent designer's always portrayed

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
as this super intelligent, moral being

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that comes down to design life.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Even the idea that government can rescue us --

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
that's no longer the wave of the future,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
projecting somebody up there,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
big and powerful, will come rescue us.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
whether it's the Illuminati

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
or the Bilderbergers.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Some patterns are real and some are not.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
So we can't just uniformly dismiss

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
all patterns like that.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
Some conspiracies really are true.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Explains a lot, maybe.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We did a whole issue on it.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
constitutes a conspiracy.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Well, that's a whole other lecture.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
You know how we know that 9/11

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Because it worked.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
(Laughter)

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
(Applause)

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
So we are natural-born dualists.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Our agenticity process comes from

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Because we can imagine, in essence,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
continuing on.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
near-death experiences,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
by accelerating in a centrifuge.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
And the brain then senses

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that there's an out-of-body experience.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
that sort of brings all this together.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
It's just a minute and a half.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Go ahead and roll it.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
for an advert for lip balm.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
in a national commercial, right?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
And this is test on some lip balms

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
that we have over here.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
And these are our models who are going to help us,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
Roger and Matt.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
And we have our own lip balm,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and we have a leading brand.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Would you have any problem

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
kissing our models to test it?

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
Girl: No.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
So this is a blind test.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
I'm going to ask you to go ahead

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and put a blindfold on.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
is how it protects your lips,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
the texture, right,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?)

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
Girl: No.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
Woman: Take a step here.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.260
(Music)

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:15.260
(Laughter)

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
(Laughter)

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
Woman: Okay.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Jennifer: Good.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:43.260
(Laughter)

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Girl: Oh my God!

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.260
(Laughter)

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
