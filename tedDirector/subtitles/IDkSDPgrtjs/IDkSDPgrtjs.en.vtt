00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So I want to take you on a trip

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
to an alien world.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
And it's not a trip

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
that requires light-years of travel,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
but it's to a place

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
where it's defined by light.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
So it's a little-appreciated fact

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that most of the animals in our ocean

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
make light.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I've spent most of my career

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I study it because I think understanding it

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
is critical to understanding life in the ocean

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
where most bioluminescence occurs.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I also use it as a tool

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
for visualizing and tracking pollution.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
But mostly I'm entranced by it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
when I went down and turned out the lights

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and saw the fireworks displays,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I've been a bioluminescence junky.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
But I would come back from those dives

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and try to share the experience with words,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and they were totally inadequate to the task.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I needed some way to share the experience directly.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And the first time I figured out that way

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
was in this little single-person submersible

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
called Deep Rover.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
This next video clip,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And the first thing you're going to see

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
is a transect screen

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that is about a meter across.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
a mess screen will come into contact

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
With the sub's lights switched off,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
it is possible to see their bioluminescence --

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
the light produced when they collide with the mesh.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
This is the first time

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
it has ever been recorded.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that has about the sensitivity

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
of the fully dark-adapted human eye.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Which means that really is what you would see

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
if you took a dive in a submersible.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
But just to try to prove that fact to you,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
at a live demonstration.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
(Laughter)

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So, if we could have the lights down

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and have it as dark in here as possible,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I have a flask

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
that has bioluminescent plankton in it.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
either because they're dead --

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
(Laughter)

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
or because I need to stir them up in some way

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Gasps)

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Oops. Sorry.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Laughter)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Okay.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So that light

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
a single-celled alga.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So why would a single-celled alga

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
need to be able to produce light?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The flash is like a scream for help.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and just like the alarm on your car or your house,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
thereby either leading to his capture

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
or scaring him away.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
There's a lot of animals that use this trick,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
for example this black dragonfish.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
It's got a light organ under its eye.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
It's got a chin barbel.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
because the top speed of this fish is one knot,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
which was the top speed of the submersible.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But it was worth it,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
because we caught it in a special capture device,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
brought it up into the lab on the ship,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and then everything on this fish lights up.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
It's unbelievable.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
That chin barbel is flashing.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
fin lights.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It's phenomenal.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And you normally don't get to see this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
For example, this shrimp

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
This blinds or distracts the predator.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This little squid is called the fire shooter

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
because of its ability to do this.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Now it may look like a tasty morsel,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
or a pig's head with wings --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
(Laughter)

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
but if it's attacked,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
it puts out a barrage of light --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I just barely got the lights out in time

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
for you to be able to see those gobs of light

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
hitting the transect screen

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and then just glowing.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It's phenomenal.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
most of them that make light.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
for defending against predators.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that's where things get really strange.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And some of these animals

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,"

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
They're things like this.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
This is a golden coral, a bush.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
It grows very slowly.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
In fact, it's thought that some of these

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
are as much as 3,000 years old,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.260
which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So if you brush up against it,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
any place you brushed against it,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
you get this twinkling blue-green light

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that's just breathtaking.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And you see things like this.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book --

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.260
just all manner of creatures all over this thing.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And these are flytrap anemones.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
But if you keep poking it,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
it starts to produce light.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
It produces these strings of light,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
presumably as some form of defense.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
There are starfish that can make light.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that dance along their arms.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
This looks like a plant,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
but it's actually an animal.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And it anchors itself in the sand

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
as you see here.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and just squeeze it at the base of the stock,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
it produces this light

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that propagates from stem to the plume,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
changing color as it goes,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
from green to blue.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Colorization and sound effects

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
added for you viewing pleasure.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
(Laughter)

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
But we have no idea why it does that.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
It's a green saber of light.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And like the one you just saw,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
it can produce these as bands of light.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
So if I squeeze the base,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
the bands go from base to tip.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
(Gasps)

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
(Laughter)

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
So there's a language of light in the deep ocean,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and we're just beginning to understand it,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and one way we're going about that

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
is we're imitating a lot of these displays.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
This is an optical lure that I've used.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
We call it the electronic jellyfish.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
It's just 16 blue LEDs

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
that we can program to do different types of displays.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
so it's unobtrusive.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So I just want to show you

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
some of the responses we've elicited

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
from animals in the deep sea.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So the camera's black and white.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
It's not high-resolution.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And what you're seeing here is a bait box

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
there are isopods all over it.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And right in the front

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
is the electronic jellyfish.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And when it starts flashing,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
But as soon as it starts to flash --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera --

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
I want you to look right here.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
There's something small there that responds.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
We're talking to something.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.260
It looks like a little of string pearls basically --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
in fact, three strings of pearls.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And this was very consistent.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
We basically have a chat room going on here,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
because once it gets started, everybody's talking.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And I think this is actually a shrimp

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
We don't know what we're saying.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Personally, I think it's something sexy.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
(Laughter)

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And then finally,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
I want to show you some responses that we recorded

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
with the world's first deep-sea webcam,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
This is going to be a glowing source first,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
which is like bioluminescent bacteria.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And it is an optical cue

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
So this scavenger comes in,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
which is a giant sixgill shark.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And I can't claim for sure

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
But if it had been following the odor plume,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
it would have come in from the other direction.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And it does actually seem to be trying

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
to eat the electronic jellyfish.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and it's going to be this pinwheel display.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And this is a burglar alarm.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And that was a Humboldt squid,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This guy is a little more contemplative.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
"Hey, wait a minute.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
There's supposed to be something else there."

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
He's thinking about it.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But he's persistent.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
He keeps coming back.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And then he goes away for a few seconds

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
to think about it some more,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and thinks,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
"Maybe if I come in from a different angle."

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
(Laughter)

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Nope.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
So we are starting to get a handle on this,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
but only just the beginnings.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
We need more eyes on the process.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
by all means, climb in and take the plunge.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
because we live on an ocean planet.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
More than 90 percent, 99 percent,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
of the living space on our planet

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
is ocean.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
It's a magical place

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
filled with breathtaking light shows

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and bizarre and wondrous creatures,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
alien life forms

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
that you don't have to travel to another planet to see.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
But if you do take the plunge,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
please remember to turn out the lights.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
But I warn you,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
it's addictive.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Thank you.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:39.260
(Applause)
