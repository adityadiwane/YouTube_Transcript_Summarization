00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.735
What keeps us healthy and happy

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.320
as we go through life?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.016
If you were going to invest now

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.096
in your future best self,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.080
where would you put your time
and your energy?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.536
There was a recent survey of millennials

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.736
asking them what their
most important life goals were,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.776
and over 80 percent said

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.936
that a major life goal for them
was to get rich.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.296
And another 50 percent
of those same young adults

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.856
said that another major life goal

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.720
was to become famous.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.176
(Laughter)

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.856
And we're constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.936
and achieve more.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.616
We're given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.456
in order to have a good life.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.696
Pictures of entire lives,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.936
of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.840
those pictures
are almost impossible to get.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.136
Most of what we know about human life

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.616
we know from asking people
to remember the past,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.416
and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.136
We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.040
and sometimes memory
is downright creative.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.176
But what if we could watch entire lives

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.056
as they unfold through time?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.056
What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.816
all the way into old age

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.760
We did that.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.856
The Harvard Study of Adult Development

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.640
may be the longest study
of adult life that's ever been done.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.840
For 75 years, we've tracked
the lives of 724 men,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.856
year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.256
and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.720
were going to turn out.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.896
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.976
Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.176
because too many people
drop out of the study,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.096
or funding for the research dries up,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.376
or the researchers get distracted,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.480
or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.536
But through a combination of luck

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.256
and the persistence
of several generations of researchers,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.840
this study has survived.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.016
About 60 of our original 724 men

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.336
are still alive,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.536
still participating in the study,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600
most of them in their 90s.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.456
And we are now beginning to study

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.840
the more than 2,000 children of these men.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.000
And I'm the fourth director of the study.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.136
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
of two groups of men.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.296
The first group started in the study

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.016
when they were sophomores
at Harvard College.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.856
They all finished college
during World War II,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.320
and then most went off
to serve in the war.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.416
And the second group that we've followed

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.616
was a group of boys
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.656
boys who were chosen for the study

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.016
specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.896
and disadvantaged families

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.656
in the Boston of the 1930s.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.280
Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.416
When they entered the study,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.376
all of these teenagers were interviewed.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.616
They were given medical exams.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.176
We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.576
And then these teenagers
grew up into adults

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.016
who entered all walks of life.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.136
They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.520
one President of the United States.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.400
Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.616
Some climbed the social ladder

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.856
from the bottom
all the way to the very top,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.160
and some made that journey
in the opposite direction.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.456
The founders of this study

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.496
would never in their wildest dreams

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.056
have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.160
telling you that
the study still continues.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.896
Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.976
calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.120
yet one more set of questions
about their lives.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.616
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.520
"Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.976
The Harvard men never ask that question.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.200
(Laughter)

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.776
To get the clearest picture
of these lives,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.736
we don't just send them questionnaires.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.216
We interview them in their living rooms.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.176
We get their medical records
from their doctors.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.696
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.416
we talk to their children.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.696
We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.256
And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.656
if they would join us
as members of the study,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.376
many of the women said,
"You know, it's about time."

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.456
(Laughter)

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.176
So what have we learned?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.416
What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.496
of information that we've generated

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.720
on these lives?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.320
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.816
The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this:

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.040
Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.816
We've learned three big lessons
about relationships.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.936
The first is that social connections
are really good for us,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.456
and that loneliness kills.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.136
It turns out that people
who are more socially connected

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.256
to family, to friends, to community,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.976
are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.376
than people who are less well connected.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.816
And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.976
People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.216
find that they are less happy,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.176
their health declines earlier in midlife,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.416
their brain functioning declines sooner

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.000
and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.256
And the sad fact
is that at any given time,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.880
more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.696
And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.376
and you can be lonely in a marriage,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.536
so the second big lesson that we learned

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.656
is that it's not just
the number of friends you have,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.176
and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.840
but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.336
It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.336
High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.136
turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.936
And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.056
Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.096
we wanted to look back at them at midlife

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.696
and to see if we could predict

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.696
who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.920
and who wasn't.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.896
And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.280
at age 50,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.616
it wasn't their middle age
cholesterol levels

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.536
that predicted how they
were going to grow old.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.016
It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.936
The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.360
were the healthiest at age 80.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.856
And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.640
from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.456
Our most happily partnered men and women

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.535
reported, in their 80s,

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:51.496
that on the days
when they had more physical pain,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.480
their mood stayed just as happy.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.656
But the people who were
in unhappy relationships,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.616
on the days when they
reported more physical pain,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.680
it was magnified by more emotional pain.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.736
And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.016
is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.520
they protect our brains.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.096
It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.016
to another person in your 80s
is protective,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.016
that the people who are in relationships

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.176
where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.896
those people's memories
stay sharper longer.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.416
And the people in relationships

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.576
where they feel they really
can't count on the other one,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.480
those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.976
And those good relationships,
they don't have to be smooth all the time.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.576
Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.336
day in and day out,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.536
but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.376
when the going got tough,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.000
those arguments didn't take a toll
on their memories.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.336
So this message,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.056
that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.016
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.880
Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.016
Well, we're human.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.856
What we'd really like is a quick fix,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.576
something we can get

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.360
that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.656
Relationships are messy
and they're complicated

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.496
and the hard work of tending
to family and friends,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.176
it's not sexy or glamorous.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.536
It's also lifelong. It never ends.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.616
The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.456
were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.456
Just like the millennials
in that recent survey,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.096
many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.136
really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.096
were what they needed to go after
to have a good life.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.296
But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.976
that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.240
with family, with friends, with community.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.056
So what about you?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.840
Let's say you're 25,
or you're 40, or you're 60.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.760
What might leaning in
to relationships even look like?

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.880
Well, the possibilities
are practically endless.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.696
It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.176
or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.400
long walks or date nights,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.216
or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.736
because those all-too-common family feuds

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.976
take a terrible toll

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.080
on the people who hold the grudges.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.920
I'd like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.656
More than a century ago,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.296
he was looking back on his life,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.600
and he wrote this:

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.536
"There isn't time, so brief is life,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.720
for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.536
There is only time for loving,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.280
and but an instant,
so to speak, for that."

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.136
The good life is built
with good relationships.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.376
Thank you.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.840
(Applause)
