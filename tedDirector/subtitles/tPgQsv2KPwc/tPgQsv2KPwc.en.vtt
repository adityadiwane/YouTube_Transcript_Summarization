00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.529
There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants
who make a lot of money.

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.727
In fact, they make
their living on this stuff.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.159
I'm going to try to save you
all the time and money

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:27.041
and go through it in the next
three minutes, so bear with me.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:30.235
Started a website in 2005
with a few friends, called Reddit.com.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.295
It's what you'd call
a social news website;

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.573
basically, the democratic front page
of the best stuff on the web.

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:39.459
You find some interesting content --
say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:43.048
and a community of your peers votes up
if they like it, down if they don't.

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:44.409
That creates the front page.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.590
It's always rising, falling;
a half million people visit every day.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:48.951
But this isn't about Reddit.

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:51.676
It's about discovering new things
that pop up on the web.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.244
In the last four years,
we've seen all kinds of memes,

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:56.893
all kinds of trends get born
right on our front page.

00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:00.133
This isn't about Reddit itself,
it's actually about humpback whales.

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:03.837
Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace,
an environmental organization

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.945
that wanted to stop the Japanese
government's whaling campaign.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.038
The whales were getting killed;
they wanted to put an end to it.

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:11.815
One of the ways they wanted to do it

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:14.327
was to put a tracking chip
inside one of the whales.

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.969
But to personify the movement,
they wanted to name it.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:19.312
So in true web fashion,
they put together a poll,

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:22.760
where they had a bunch of very erudite,
very thoughtful, cultured names.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.038
I believe this is the Farsi word
for "immortal."

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.096
I think this means "divine power
of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.950
And then there was this:
"Mister Splashy Pants."

00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:33.208
(Laughter)

00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:34.597
And this was a special name.

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:38.294
Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends,
was very popular on the Internet.

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:40.066
In fact, someone on Reddit thought,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.404
"What a great thing,
we should all vote this up."

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:44.831
And Redditors responded and all agreed.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.144
So the voting started.

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.038
We got behind it ourselves;
we changed our logo for the day,

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:51.632
from the alien to Splashy,
to help the cause.

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:54.648
And it wasn't long before other sites
like Fark and Boing Boing

00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:57.949
and the rest of the Internet started
saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"

00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:01.618
So it went from about five percent,
which was when this meme started,

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.236
to 70 percent at the end of voting.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.646
Pretty impressive, right?
We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.696
Just kidding -- Greenpeace
actually wasn't that crazy about it,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.546
because they wanted one
of the more thoughtful names to win.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.777
They said, "No, just kidding.
We'll give it another week of voting."

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:20.236
Well, that got us a little angry,
so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.261
(Laughter)

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:24.173
And the Reddit community --
really, the rest of the Internet,

00:02:24.197 --> 00:02:25.348
really got behind this.

00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:26.771
Facebook groups were created.

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.493
Facebook applications were created.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:31.739
The idea was, "Vote your conscience,
vote for Mister Splashy Pants."

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:34.809
People were putting up signs
in the real world about this whale.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:35.834
(Laughter)

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:38.619
This was the final vote:
78 percent of the votes.

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:42.640
To give you an idea of the landslide,
the next highest name pulled in three.

00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:45.801
There was a clear lesson:
the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:47.563
Which is obvious. It's a great name.

00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:50.839
Everyone wants to hear their news
anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:51.864
(Laughter)

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:53.717
I think that's what helped drive this.

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.621
What was cool were the repercussions.

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:58.526
Greenpeace created an entire
marketing campaign around it --

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.343
Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.088
an e-card so you could send
your friend a dancing Splashy.

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:06.376
But even more important
was that they accomplished their mission.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.232
The Japanese government
called off their whaling expedition.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.423
Mission accomplished:
Greenpeace was thrilled,

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:13.356
the whales were happy -- that's a quote.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.381
(Laughter)

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.554
And actually, Redditors
in the Internet community

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:20.258
were happy to participate,
but they weren't whale lovers.

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:23.009
A few, certainly, but we're talking
about a lot of people,

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.148
really interested
and caught up in this meme.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:28.672
Greenpeace came back to the site
and thanked Reddit for its participation.

00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:32.303
But this wasn't really altruism;
just interest in doing something cool.

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.243
This is how the Internet works.
This is that great big secret.

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.327
The Internet provides
a level playing field.

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.315
Your link is as good as your link,
which is as good as my link.

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.537
With a browser, anyone can get
to any website no matter your budget.

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.231
That is, as long as you can
keep net neutrality in place.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:49.353
Another important thing is it costs
nothing to get content online.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.475
There are so many
publishing tools available,

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.797
it only takes a few minutes
to produce something.

00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:56.501
and the cost of iteration
is so cheap, you might as well.

00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:58.538
If you do, be genuine.
Be honest, up-front.

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:00.581
One of the great lessons
Greenpeace learned

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:02.429
is that it's OK to lose control,

00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:04.521
OK to take yourself
a little less seriously,

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:06.898
given that, even though
it's a very serious cause,

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:08.834
you could ultimately achieve your goal.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:12.033
That's the final message I want to share:
you can do well online.

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:14.975
But no longer is the message
coming from just the top down.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.840
If you want to succeed you've got
to be OK to lose control.

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:19.270
Thank you.

00:04:19.294 --> 00:04:21.294
(Applause)
