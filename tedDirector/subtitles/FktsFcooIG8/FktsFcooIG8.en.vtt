00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:18.935
I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.007
I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:25.374
and I'm especially interested in a possibility of

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:30.106
making our brains smarter, better and faster.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:32.982
This is in this context I'm going to tell you

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.732
about video games. When we say video games,

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:38.270
most of you think about children.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.248
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:45.166
But let's be frank.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:49.955
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:56.439
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.446
not eight years old, and in fact, if we look

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.155
at the projected demographics of video game play,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:05.888
the video game players of tomorrow are

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:09.012
older adults. (Laughter)

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:13.263
So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:17.646
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:21.033
on our everyday life. Consider these statistics

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:26.848
released by Activision. After one month of release

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:31.340
of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.713
for 68,000 years

00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:36.579
worldwide, right?

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.526
Would any of you complain if this was the case

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:42.689
about doing linear algebra?

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.984
So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:48.832
Now I want to step back a bit.

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:52.073
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:56.793
home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.

00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:58.933
(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.897
after your enemy zombie bad guys

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:05.487
before they get to you, right?

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:08.664
And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,

00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:11.985
"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:15.312
than shooting at zombies?"

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:18.778
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:21.275
in the context of what you would have thought

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.784
if you had found your girl playing sudoku

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:29.135
or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:31.872
Most parents would find that great.

00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:35.216
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:38.184
days in and days out is actually good for your health.

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:41.384
It's not, and binging is never good.

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:45.375
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.344
actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,

00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:50.928
those action-packed shooter games

00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:54.704
have quite powerful effects and positive effects

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:58.562
on many different aspects of our behavior.

00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:02.257
There's not one week that goes without some major

00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:05.033
headlines in the media about whether video games are

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:09.649
good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:15.337
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:18.480
and get you to actually step into the lab.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.353
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,

00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:24.120
in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.889
of video games on the brain.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.224
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:32.823
One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard

00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:35.109
is the fact that too much screen time

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.924
makes your eyesight worse.

00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:40.127
That's a statement about vision.

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:42.663
There may be vision scientists among you.

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:45.602
We actually know how to test that statement.

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:49.039
We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.720
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.710
of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.242
in front of screens, have normal, or what we call

00:03:59.242 --> 00:04:01.896
corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:04.345
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:07.625
indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.500
10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.728
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:15.425
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:17.865
It's better than those that don't play.

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:20.137
And it's better in two different ways.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:22.562
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:25.817
small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:29.615
being able to read the fine print on a prescription

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:34.242
rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:35.808
with just your eyesight.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.624
The other way that they are better is actually being able

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:41.533
to resolve different levels of gray.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.704
Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference

00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:47.185
between seeing the car in front of you

00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:50.928
and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.

00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:53.944
So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:58.418
for patients with low vision, and to have an impact

00:04:58.418 --> 00:05:01.753
on retraining their brain to see better.

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:05.402
Clearly, when it comes to action video games,

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:08.297
screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.

00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:12.283
Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:

00:05:12.283 --> 00:05:16.657
Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:20.562
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.

00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:24.163
I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:26.888
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:29.912
to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:35.345
colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.

00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:38.728
Right? So this is the first example.

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:39.818
["Chair"]

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:42.879
Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.259
["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.553
["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.878
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.

00:05:46.878 --> 00:05:48.387
["Blue"] DB: Yellow.

00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:54.742
Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:58.078
You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?

00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:02.032
Because I introduced a conflict between

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:04.945
the word itself and its color.

00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:07.984
How good your attention is determines actually how fast

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:10.511
you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here

00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:13.072
at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.616
than some of us that are older.

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:18.184
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task

00:06:18.184 --> 00:06:19.784
with people that play a lot of action games,

00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:23.104
they actually resolve the conflict faster.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:26.312
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:28.795
to attention problems.

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:30.766
Actually, those action video game players have

00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:33.083
many other advantages in terms of attention, and one

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.982
aspect of attention which is also improved for the better

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:40.760
is our ability to track objects around in the world.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.304
This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,

00:06:43.304 --> 00:06:46.552
you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:49.627
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,

00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:52.680
and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.744
In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,

00:06:55.744 --> 00:06:57.824
sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them

00:06:57.824 --> 00:07:00.720
little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.672
You're going to see yellow happy faces

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:07.488
and a few sad blue faces. These are children

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:11.308
in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess

00:07:11.308 --> 00:07:15.609
during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:18.736
But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:22.056
Everybody begins to move around, and your task

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:25.180
is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.671
and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.500
where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.837
actually track it with your eyes. You can track,

00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:35.117
you can track, and then when it stops, and there is

00:07:35.117 --> 00:07:39.048
a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?

00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:41.876
Was it yellow initially or blue?

00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:45.673
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:50.469
I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.557
a little more challenging task. There are going to be

00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:55.740
three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.993
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated

00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:00.639
and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:03.487
you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.

00:08:03.487 --> 00:08:04.950
Yellow or blue?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.596
Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:09.099
So your typical normal young adult

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:12.735
can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.

00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:15.495
That's what we just did. Your action video game player

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.695
has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:21.673
which is what is shown in this video here.

00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:25.149
That's for you guys, action video game players.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:27.034
A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)

00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:30.742
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:33.946
that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:37.550
Good. So in the same way that we actually see

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.028
the effects of video games on people's behavior,

00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:44.093
we can use brain imaging and look at the impact

00:08:44.093 --> 00:08:47.878
of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,

00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:51.238
but the main changes are actually to the brain networks

00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:55.782
that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex

00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:59.501
which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.

00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:01.934
The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls

00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:04.644
how we sustain attention, and another one

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.213
is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.510
and regulate attention and resolve conflict.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.374
Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three

00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:16.718
of these networks are actually much more efficient

00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:19.478
in people that play action games.

00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:24.229
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding

00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:27.670
in the literature about technology and the brain.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.119
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:34.329
of multitasking when you're driving

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:39.020
and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.923
Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,

00:09:42.923 --> 00:09:47.071
you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly

00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:49.519
to the car braking in front of you, and so you're

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:55.090
much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.966
Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.

00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:00.438
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see

00:10:00.438 --> 00:10:02.783
how many car accidents they have. That would be a little

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:06.330
costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.448
where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,

00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:13.976
how good they are at switching from one task to another.

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:16.544
When we do that, we actually find that people

00:10:16.544 --> 00:10:19.628
that play a lot of action games are really, really good.

00:10:19.628 --> 00:10:24.111
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.

00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:26.769
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:30.501
in the context of another group of technology users,

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:32.911
a group which is actually much revered by society,

00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:37.450
which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.095
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:44.376
most of our children, are engaged with listening to music

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:47.123
at the same time as they're doing search on the web

00:10:47.123 --> 00:10:50.480
at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.816
That's a multimedia-tasker.

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:56.376
There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford

00:10:56.376 --> 00:10:58.929
and that we replicated that showed that

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:03.576
those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers

00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:07.423
are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:10.160
When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.866
Right? So these kinds of results really

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:15.352
makes two main points.

00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:18.544
The first one is that not all media are created equal.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:23.456
You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking

00:11:23.456 --> 00:11:25.102
and the effect of playing action games. They have

00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:28.494
totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:31.608
perception and attention.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.448
Even within video games, I'm telling you right now

00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:36.201
about these action-packed video games.

00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:39.535
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.

00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:42.217
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure

00:11:42.217 --> 00:11:44.728
what is the effect of each video game.

00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:49.015
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.

00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:52.071
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:54.519
despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:58.527
have a lot of very good vision, etc.

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:01.845
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates

00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:05.086
that actually report engaging in a lot of high

00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:10.063
multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.353
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad

00:12:12.353 --> 00:12:15.039
and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:18.895
this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.

00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:21.840
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.432
and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.

00:12:25.432 --> 00:12:30.015
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.495
of video games on the brain, it's very similar

00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:36.359
to the effect of wine on the health.

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:39.399
There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:43.615
very poor uses of video games. But when consumed

00:12:43.615 --> 00:12:47.096
in reasonable doses, and at the right age,

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:50.367
wine can be very good for health. There are actually

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:53.631
specific molecules that have been identified

00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:59.463
in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.

00:12:59.463 --> 00:13:02.735
So it's the same way, like those action video games

00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:04.397
have a number of ingredients that are actually really

00:13:04.397 --> 00:13:08.367
powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:11.972
vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on

00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:14.727
understanding what are those active ingredients so that

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:18.617
we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,

00:13:18.617 --> 00:13:22.860
either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.639
Now because we are interested in having an impact

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.127
for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually

00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:32.543
not that interested in how those of you that choose

00:13:32.543 --> 00:13:36.415
to play video games for many hours on end perform.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:40.240
I'm much more interested in taking any of you

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.020
and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.883
I can actually change your vision for the better,

00:13:46.883 --> 00:13:49.214
whether you want to play that action game or not, right?

00:13:49.214 --> 00:13:51.630
That's the point of rehabilitation or education.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.556
Most of the kids don't go to school saying,

00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:56.296
"Great, two hours of math!"

00:13:56.296 --> 00:14:00.735
So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,

00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:03.199
we need to go one more step.

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:06.223
And one more step is to do training studies.

00:14:06.223 --> 00:14:09.623
So let me illustrate that step with

00:14:09.623 --> 00:14:13.191
a task which is called mental rotation.

00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:17.366
Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:19.251
and again you're going to do the task,

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:22.936
to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,

00:14:22.936 --> 00:14:26.190
and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.030
One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:33.334
version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:

00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:38.175
the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?

00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:40.592
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.

00:14:40.592 --> 00:14:45.122
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:50.096
That's our target shape.

00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:53.799
Third. Good! This is hard, right?

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.286
Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because

00:14:55.286 --> 00:14:58.020
you really feel your brain cringing, right?

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.452
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:04.157
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people

00:15:04.157 --> 00:15:06.766
come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,

00:15:06.766 --> 00:15:11.096
we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.

00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:13.842
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.

00:15:13.842 --> 00:15:16.952
They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes

00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:21.253
several days over a period of two weeks.

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.049
Then, once they are done with the training, they come back

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:27.022
a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type

00:15:27.022 --> 00:15:30.638
of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.173
in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,

00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:35.371
you know, subjects perform where they are expected

00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:40.581
to perform given their age. After two weeks of training

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:44.437
on action video games, they actually perform better,

00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:49.793
and the improvement is still there five months after

00:15:49.793 --> 00:15:52.661
having done the training. That's really, really important.

00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:55.141
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.341
for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects

00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:01.277
that are going to be long-lasting.

00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:04.130
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.763
well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market

00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:10.315
a game that would be good for the attention

00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:13.835
of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,

00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:16.418
or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:20.227
of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?

00:16:20.227 --> 00:16:24.707
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.

00:16:24.707 --> 00:16:26.618
There are brain scientists like me that are beginning

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.875
to understand what are the good ingredients in games

00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.980
to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.554
to call the broccoli side of the equation.

00:16:36.554 --> 00:16:40.290
There is an entertainment software industry

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.762
which is extremely deft at coming up with

00:16:43.762 --> 00:16:47.906
appealing products that you can't resist.

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:51.434
That's the chocolate side of the equation.

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:54.458
The issue is we need to put the two together,

00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:56.714
and it's a little bit like with food.

00:16:56.714 --> 00:17:00.355
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?

00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:02.614
None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had

00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:04.946
that feeling, right, picking up an education game

00:17:04.946 --> 00:17:08.338
and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,

00:17:08.338 --> 00:17:10.755
it's not really engaging. So what we need

00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:14.106
is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:18.117
that is irresistible, that you really want to play,

00:17:18.117 --> 00:17:21.102
but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients

00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:24.330
that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.169
but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,

00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:31.645
but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,

00:17:31.645 --> 00:17:34.608
people that work in the entertainment software industry,

00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:37.346
and publishers, so these are not people that usually

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.683
meet every day, but it's actually doable,

00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:42.330
and we are on the right track.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.112
I'd like to leave you with that thought,

00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:47.479
and thank you for your attention. (Applause)

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:51.479
(Applause)
