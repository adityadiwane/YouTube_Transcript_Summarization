00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.667
I get asked a lot what the difference
between my work is

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:31.976
and typical Pentagon
long-range strategic planners.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.976
And the answer I like to offer is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.976
what they typically do is they think
about the future of wars

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.976
in the context of war.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.976
And what I've spent 15 years
doing in this business --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.239
and it's taken me almost
14 to figure it out --

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:47.976
is I think about the future of wars
in the context of everything else.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
So I tend to specialize
on the scene between war and peace.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.976
The material I'm going to show
you is one idea from a book

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.976
with a lot of ideas.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.524
It's the one that takes me
around the world right now

00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:00.834
interacting with foreign
militaries quite a bit.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.976
The material was generated
in two years of work I did

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.976
for the Secretary of Defense,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.976
thinking about a new
national grand strategy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.150
for the United States.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:10.255
I'm going to present a problem

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:12.279
and try to give you an answer.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.976
Here's my favorite bonehead concept
from the 1990s in the Pentagon:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.976
the theory of anti-access,
area-denial asymmetrical strategies.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.976
Why do we call it that?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Because it's got all those
A's lined up I guess.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.976
This is gobbledygook for

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.976
if the United States fights
somebody we're going to be huge.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.976
They're going to be small.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
And if they try to fight us
in the traditional, straight-up manner

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.976
we're going to kick their ass,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.976
which is why people don't
try to do that any more.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.976
I met the last Air Force
General who had actually

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.976
shot down an enemy plane in combat.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.976
He's now a one star General.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.976
That's how distant
we are from even meeting an air force

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.976
willing to fly against ours.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
So that overmatched capability
creates problems --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
catastrophic successes
the White House calls them.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.976
And we're trying to figure that out,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.976
because it is an amazing capability.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.976
The question is, what's the good
you can do with it?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.976
OK?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.976
The theory of anti-access, area-denial
asymmetrical strategies --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
gobbledygook that we sell to Congress,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
because if we just told them
we can kick anybody's asses

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.048
they wouldn't buy us
all the stuff we want.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:27.976
So we say, area-denial, anti-access
asymmetrical strategies

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.976
and their eyes glaze over.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.976
(Laughter)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
And they say, "Will you
build it in my district?"

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.976
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.976
(Applause)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.976
Here's my parody and it ain't much of one.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.976
Let's talk about a battle space.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
I don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.976
Let's talk about an enemy embedded
within that battle space.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.976
I don't know, the Million Man Swim.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.976
(Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.143
The United States has to access
that battle space instantaneously.

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.976
They throw up anti-access,
area-denial asymmetrical strategies.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.976
A banana peel on the tarmac.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.976
(Laughter)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.976
Trojan horses on our computer networks

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.976
reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.976
We say, "China, it's yours."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.976
Prometheus approach, largely
a geographic definition,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.976
focuses almost exclusively
on the start of conflict.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
We field the first-half team in a league

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.976
that insists on keeping score
until the end of the game.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.976
That's the problem.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.976
We can run the score up against anybody,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.429
and then get our asses
kicked in the second half --

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:29.976
what they call fourth generation warfare.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.143
Here's the way
I like to describe it instead.

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:34.976
There is no battle space the U.S.
Military cannot access.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.976
They said we couldn't do Afghanistan.
We did it with ease.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.976
They said we couldn't do Iraq.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.976
We did it with 150 combat
casualties in six weeks.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.976
We did it so fast we weren't
prepared for their collapse.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.976
There is nobody we can't take down.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.976
The question is, what do
you do with the power?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.191
So there's no trouble
accessing battle spaces.

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:56.976
What we have trouble accessing
is the transition space

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
that must naturally follow,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and creating the peace space
that allows us to move on.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.096
Problem is, the Defense
Department over here

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
beats the hell out of you.

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.541
The State Department over here says,

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:11.565
"Come on boy, I know you can make it."

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:13.976
And that poor country runs off that ledge,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.976
does that cartoon thing and then drops.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.976
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.976
This is not about overwhelming
force, but proportional force.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.976
It's about non-lethal technologies,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
because if you fire real ammo into a crowd

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of women and children rioting

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:33.976
you're going to lose friends very quickly.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.858
This is not about projecting
power, but about staying power,

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.976
which is about legitimacy with the locals.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.048
Who do you access in this
transition space?

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:44.692
You have to create internal partners.
You have to access coalition partners.

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.976
We asked the Indians
for 17,000 peace keepers.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.976
I know their senior leadership,
they wanted to give it to us.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.976
But they said to us, "You know what?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
In that transition space you're
mostly hat not enough cattle.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:56.976
We don't think you can pull it off,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.976
we're not going to give you
our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
We asked the Russians for 40,000.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.976
They said no.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.976
I was in China in August, I said,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.976
"You should have 50,000
peace keepers in Iraq.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's your oil, not ours."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.976
Which is the truth. It's their oil.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.143
And the Chinese said to me, "Dr.
Barnett, you're absolutely right.

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:17.976
In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.976
But it's not a perfect world,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and your administration isn't
getting us any closer."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.048
But we have trouble
accessing our outcomes.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.976
We lucked out, frankly, on the selection.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.976
We face different opponents
across these three.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.976
And it's time to start admitting

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.976
you can't ask the same 19-year-old
to do it all, day in and day out.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.976
It's just too damn hard.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We have an unparalleled
capacity to wage war.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.976
We don't do the everything else so well.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.976
Frankly, we do it better than anybody
and we still suck at it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.976
We have a brilliant Secretary of War.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.976
We don't have a Secretary
of Everything Else.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.858
Because if we did, that guy
would be in front of the Senate,

00:05:55.882 --> 00:05:57.976
still testifying over Abu Ghraib.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.976
The problem is he doesn't exist.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There is no Secretary of Everything Else.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.976
I think we have an unparalleled
capacity to wage war.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.976
I call that the Leviathan Force.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.976
What we need to build is a force
for the Everything Else.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.976
I call them the System Administrators.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.976
What I think this really represents

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.976
is lack of an A to Z rule set
for the world as a whole

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.048
for processing politically
bankrupt states.

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.976
We have one for processing
economically bankrupt states.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.976
It's the IMF Sovereign
Bankruptcy Plan, OK?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.976
We argue about it every time we use it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.976
Argentina just went through it,
broke a lot of rules.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.191
They got out on the far end, we said,
"Fine, don't worry about it."

00:06:33.215 --> 00:06:35.976
It's transparent. A certain
amount of certainty

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.976
gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.858
We don't have one for processing
politically bankrupt states

00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:42.976
that, frankly, everybody wants gone.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Like Saddam, like Mugabe,
like Kim Jong-Il --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.976
people who kill in hundreds
of thousands or millions.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.976
What would an A to Z system look like?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.096
I'm going to distinguish
between what I call

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.120
front half and back half.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.976
And let's call this red line,
I don't know, mission accomplished.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.976
(Laughter)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.976
(Applause)

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.976
What we have extant right now,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.976
at the beginning of this system, is the U.N.
Security Council as a grand jury.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.976
What can they do?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They can indict your ass.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.976
They can debate it. They can
write it on a piece of paper.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.381
They can put it in an envelope
and mail it to you,

00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:30.976
and then say in no uncertain
terms, "Please cut that out."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.976
(Laughter)

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.381
That gets you about four million dead
in Central Africa over the 1990s.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:43.405
That gets you 250,000 dead
in the Sudan in the last 15 months.

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:44.976
Everybody's got to answer
their grandchildren some day

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.048
what you did
about the holocaust in Africa,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and you better have an answer.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.976
We don't have anything to translate
that will into action.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.976
What we do have is the U.S.-enabled
Leviathan Force that says,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.976
"You want me to take that guy down?
I'll take that guy down.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.976
I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost
you 20 billion dollars."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.976
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.976
But here's the deal.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.286
As soon as I can't find
anybody else to air out,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.976
I leave the scene immediately.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
That's called the Powell Doctrine.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.976
Way downstream we have
the International Criminal Court.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.976
They love to put them on trial.
They've got Milosević right now.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.976
What are we missing?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.976
A functioning executive
that will translate will into action,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.976
because we don't have it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.976
Every time we lead one of these efforts

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
we have to whip ourselves
into this imminent threat thing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.976
We haven't faced an imminent threat since

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.976
the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.976
But we use this language from a bygone era

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.976
to scare ourselves into doing something

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.429
because we're a democracy
and that's what it takes.

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:50.977
And if that doesn't work
we scream, "He's got a gun!"

00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:51.976
just as we rush in.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.976
(Laughter)

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.976
And then we look over the body

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.286
and we find an old cigarette
lighter and we say,

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.976
"Jesus, it was dark."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.976
(Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.976
Do you want to do it, France?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.976
France says, "No, but I do
like to criticize you after the fact."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.976
What we need downstream
is a great power enabled --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.976
what I call that Sys Admin Force.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.976
We should have had 250,000
troops streaming into Iraq

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.976
on the heels of that Leviathan
sweeping towards Baghdad.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.976
What do you get then?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.976
No looting, no military disappearing,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.048
no arms disappearing,
no ammo disappearing,

00:09:29.072 --> 00:09:31.311
no Muqtada Al-Sadr -- I'm
wrecking his bones --

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:32.976
no insurgency.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.976
Talk to anybody who was over there
in the first six months.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.976
We had six months to feel
the lob, to get the job done,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.976
and we dicked around for six months.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.976
And then they turned on us.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.976
Why? Because they just got fed up.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.976
They saw what we did to Saddam.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.976
They said, "You're that powerful,
you can resurrect this country.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.976
You're America."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.976
What we need is an international
reconstruction fund --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.239
Sebastian Mallaby,
Washington Post, great idea.

00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:55.976
Model on the IMF.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
Instead of passing the hat each time, OK?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.976
Where are we going to find this guy?
G20, that's easy.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.976
Check out their agenda since 9/11.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.976
All security dominated.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.976
They're going to decide up front
how the money gets spent

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.976
just like in the IMF.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
You vote according to how much
money you put in the kitty.

00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:13.976
Here's my challenge
to the Defense Department.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.976
You've got to build this force.
You've got to seed this force.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.191
You've got to track coalition partners.
Create a record of success.

00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:21.976
You will get this model.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.976
You tell me it's too hard to do.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.976
I'll walk this dog right
through that six part series on the Balkans.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.976
We did it just like that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.976
I'm talking about regularizing
it, making it transparent.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.976
Would you like Mugabe gone?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.976
Would you like Kim Jong-Il,
who's killed about two million people,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
would you like him gone?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Would you like a better system?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.976
This is why it matters to the military.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.976
They've been experiencing an identity
crisis since the end of the Cold War.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.048
I'm not talking about the difference
between reality and desire,

00:10:51.072 --> 00:10:53.453
which I can do because I'm
not inside the beltway.

00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:55.976
(Laughter)

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.976
I'm talking about the 1990s.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.976
The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.976
The split starts to emerge
between those in the military

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.976
who see a future they can live with,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.976
and those who see a future
that starts to scare them,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.976
like the U.S. submarine community,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.381
which watches the Soviet
Navy disappear overnight.

00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:11.976
Ah!

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.976
(Laughter)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.976
So they start moving
from reality towards desire

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and they create their own special language

00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:23.167
to describe their voyage of self-discovery
and self-actualization.

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.976
(Laughter)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.976
The problem is you need a big,
sexy opponent to fight against.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.477
And if you can't find
one you've got to make one up.

00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:32.976
China, all grown up, going to be a looker!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.976
(Laughter)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.976
The rest of the military got
dragged down into the muck

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.976
across the 1990s

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.762
and they developed this very
derisive term to describe it:

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.786
military operations other than war.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.953
I ask you, who joins the military
to do things other than war?

00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:49.976
Actually, most of them.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.976
Jessica Lynch never
planned on shooting back.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Most of them don't pick up a rifle.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.096
I maintain this is code
inside the Army for,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.120
"We don't want to do this."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.096
They spent the 1990s
working the messy scene

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.976
between globalized parts of the world

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
What I call the core and the gap.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.976
The Clinton administration wasn't
interested in running this.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.976
For eight years, after screwing
up the relationship on day one --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.976
inauguration day with gays
in the military --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.976
which was deft.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.976
(Laughter)

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.976
So we were home alone for eight years.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.976
And what did we do home alone?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.239
We bought one military
and we operated another.

00:12:29.263 --> 00:12:31.644
It's like the guy who goes
to the doctor and says,

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.976
"Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.976
(Laughter)

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.976
The doctor says, "Stop
doing that you idiot."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.976
I used to give this brief
inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.976
I'd say, "You're buying one military
and you're operating another,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.191
and eventually it's going to hurt.
It's wrong.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:47.976
Bad Pentagon, bad!"

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.976
(Laughter)

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.239
And they'd say, "Dr.
Barnett, you are so right.

00:12:52.263 --> 00:12:54.597
Can you come back next year
and remind us again?"

00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:59.976
(Laughter)

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.976
Some people say 9/11 heals the rift --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.976
jerks the long-term transformation gurus

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.976
out of their 30,000 foot view of history,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.976
drags them down in to the muck and says,
"You want a networked opponent?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.976
I've got one, he's everywhere,
go find him."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.976
It elevates MOOTW --
how we pronounce that acronym --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.976
from crap to grand strategy,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.976
because that's how you're
going to shrink that gap.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.976
Some people put these two things together

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they call it empire, which I think
is a boneheaded concept.

00:13:24.024 --> 00:13:26.977
Empire is about the enforcement
of not just minimal rule sets,

00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:27.976
which you cannot do,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.976
but maximum rule sets which you must do.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.976
It's not our system of governance.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.976
Never how we've sought to interact
with the outside world.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.048
I prefer that phrase
System Administration.

00:13:36.072 --> 00:13:37.976
We enforce the minimal rule sets

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.429
for maintaining connectivity
to the global economy.

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.453
Certain bad things you cannot do.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.976
How this impacts the way we think
about the future of war.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.096
This is a concept which gets me
vilified throughout the Pentagon.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.976
It makes me very popular as well.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.976
Everybody's got an opinion.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.143
Going back to the beginning
of our country --

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.167
historically, defenses meant
protection of the homeland.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.976
Security has meant everything else.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.976
Written into our constitution,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.976
two different forces,
two different functions.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.976
Raise an army when you need it,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.976
and maintain a navy
for day-to-day connectivity.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.976
A Department of War,
a Department of Everything Else.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
A big stick, a baton stick.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Can of whup ass,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.976
the networking force.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.048
In 1947 we merged these
two things together

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:31.976
in the Defense Department.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.976
Our long-term rationale becomes,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.976
we're involved in a hair trigger
stand off with the Soviets.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.976
To attack America is to risk
blowing up the world.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.976
We connected national security
to international security

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
with about a seven minute time delay.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.976
That's not our problem now.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.239
They can kill
three million in Chicago tomorrow

00:14:52.263 --> 00:14:54.976
and we don't go
to the mattresses with nukes.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.976
That's the scary part.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.976
The question is how do we reconnect
American national security

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.976
with global security to make
the world a lot more comfortable,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.976
and to embed and contextualize
our employment

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
of force around the planet?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
What's happened
since is that bifurcation I described.

00:15:16.826 --> 00:15:17.976
We talked about this
going all the way back

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.976
to the end of the Cold War.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.976
Let's have a Department of War,
and a Department of Something Else.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.976
Some people say, "Hell,
9/11 did it for you."

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.048
Now we've got a home
game and an away game.

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:33.072
(Laughter)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.286
The Department of Homeland Security
is a strategic feel good measure.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.239
It's going to be the Department
of Agriculture for the 21st century.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.976
TSA -- thousands standing around.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.822
(Laughter)

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:53.822
I supported the war in Iraq.

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:55.822
He was a bad guy with multiple priors.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.822
It's not like we had to find him

00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:01.846
actually killing somebody
live to arrest him.

00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:05.513
I knew we'd kick ass in the war
with the Leviathan Force.

00:16:05.537 --> 00:16:07.822
I knew we'd have a hard
time with what followed.

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:11.323
But I know this organization doesn't
change until it experiences failure.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.989
What do I mean by these
two different forces?

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:16.822
This is the Hobbesian Force.

00:16:16.846 --> 00:16:18.822
I love this force. I don't
want to see it go.

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.822
That plus nukes rules out great power war.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.822
This is the military the rest
of the world wants us to build.

00:16:22.846 --> 00:16:26.037
It's why I travel all over the world
talking to foreign militaries.

00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:28.822
What does this mean?

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:30.822
It means you've got to stop pretending

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:34.323
you can do these two very disparate
skill sets with the same 19-year-old.

00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:36.822
Switching back, morning,
afternoon, evening,

00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:38.822
morning, afternoon, evening.

00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:40.822
Handing out aid, shooting back,

00:16:40.846 --> 00:16:42.822
handing out aid, shooting back.

00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:44.822
It's too much.

00:16:44.846 --> 00:16:47.822
The 19-year-olds get tired
from the switching, OK?

00:16:47.846 --> 00:16:49.822
(Laughter)

00:16:49.846 --> 00:16:52.846
That force on the left, you can
train a 19-year-old to do that.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.822
That force on the right is more
like a 40-year-old cop.

00:16:55.846 --> 00:16:57.846
You need the experience.

00:16:58.846 --> 00:17:00.894
What does this mean
in terms of operations?

00:17:02.846 --> 00:17:04.846
The rule is going to be this.

00:17:05.846 --> 00:17:08.822
That Sys Admin force is the force
that never comes home,

00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:10.822
does most of your work.

00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:13.822
You break out that Leviathan
Force only every so often.

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.822
But here's the promise you
make to the American public,

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:17.822
to your own people, to the world.

00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:19.822
You break out that Leviathan Force,

00:17:19.846 --> 00:17:22.822
you promise, you guarantee
that you're going to mount

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:26.822
one hell of a -- immediately
-- follow-on Sys Admin effort.

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:29.513
Don't plan for the war unless you
plan to win the peace.

00:17:29.537 --> 00:17:34.822
(Applause)

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.822
Other differences. Leviathan

00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:39.227
traditional partners,
they all look like the Brits

00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:40.822
and their former colonies.

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:42.822
(Laughter)

00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:44.822
Including us, I would remind you.

00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.822
The rest -- wider array of partners.

00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:48.822
International organizations,
non-governmental organizations,

00:17:48.846 --> 00:17:50.822
private voluntary
organizations, contractors.

00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:52.822
You're not going to get away from that.

00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:56.608
Leviathan Force, it's all about joint
operations between the military services.

00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:57.822
We're done with that.

00:17:57.846 --> 00:18:00.822
What we need to do
is inter-agency operations,

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:02.846
which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.156
And I'm amazed nobody asked her
that question when she was confirmed.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.822
I call the Leviathan Force
your dad's military.

00:18:08.846 --> 00:18:12.822
I like them young, male,
unmarried, slightly pissed off.

00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:19.822
(Laughter)

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:22.085
I call the Sys Admin Force
your mom's military.

00:18:22.109 --> 00:18:24.085
It's everything the man's military hates.

00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:28.822
Gender balanced much more, older,
educated, married with children.

00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:31.822
The force on the left, up or out.

00:18:31.846 --> 00:18:33.846
The force on the right, in and out.

00:18:34.846 --> 00:18:37.822
The force on the left respects
Posse Comitatus restrictions

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:39.822
on the use of force inside the U.S.

00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:41.822
The force on the right's going
to obliterate it.

00:18:41.846 --> 00:18:42.822
That's where the National
Guard's going to be.

00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:44.822
The force on the left is never
coming under the purview

00:18:44.846 --> 00:18:46.822
of the International Criminal Court.

00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:48.846
Sys Admin Force has to.

00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:53.822
Different definitions
of network centricity.

00:18:53.846 --> 00:18:56.822
One takes down networks, one puts them up.

00:18:56.846 --> 00:19:00.822
And you've got to wage war here
in such a way to facilitate that.

00:19:00.846 --> 00:19:02.822
Do we need a bigger budget?

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:05.822
Do we need a draft to pull this off?

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:07.846
Absolutely not.

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:13.132
I've been told by the Revolution
of Military Affairs crowd for years,

00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:16.822
we can do it faster, cheaper,
smaller, just as lethal.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:20.822
I say, "Great, I'm going to take the Sys
Admin budget out of your hide."

00:19:20.846 --> 00:19:22.822
Here's the larger point.

00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:24.822
You're going to build the Sys Admin
Force inside the U.S. Military first.

00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:28.822
But ultimately you're going
to civilianize it, probably two thirds.

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:32.822
Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it.

00:19:32.846 --> 00:19:34.822
So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,

00:19:34.846 --> 00:19:37.822
but over time it's going
to cross that river.

00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:40.822
(Laughter)

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.822
I have been to the mountain top.
I can see the future.

00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:47.180
I may not live long enough to get you
there, but it's going to happen.

00:19:47.204 --> 00:19:49.585
We're going to have
a Department of Something Else

00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:50.822
between war and peace.

00:19:50.846 --> 00:19:51.822
Last slide.

00:19:51.846 --> 00:19:53.822
Who gets custody of the kids?

00:19:53.846 --> 00:19:56.704
This is where the Marines
in the audience get kind of tense.

00:19:56.728 --> 00:20:02.822
(Laughter)

00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:05.704
And this is when they think
about beating the crap out of me

00:20:05.728 --> 00:20:06.822
after the talk.

00:20:06.846 --> 00:20:07.822
(Laughter)

00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:09.822
Read Max Boon.

00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:11.822
This is the history of the marines
-- small wars, small arms.

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.822
The Marines are like my West
Highland Terrier.

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:16.227
They get up every morning,
they want to dig a hole

00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:17.822
and they want to kill something.

00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:19.822
(Laughter)

00:20:19.846 --> 00:20:22.822
I don't want my Marines handing out aid.

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.846
I want them to be Marines.

00:20:25.846 --> 00:20:27.822
That's what keeps the Sys Admin
Force from being a pussy force.

00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:29.822
It keeps it from being the U.N.

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:31.822
You shoot at these people the Marines
are going to come over and kill you.

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.822
(Laughter)

00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:37.822
(Applause)

00:20:37.846 --> 00:20:40.822
Department of Navy,
strategic subs go this way,

00:20:40.846 --> 00:20:42.822
surface combatants are over there,

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:45.132
and the news is they may
actually be that small.

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:47.822
(Laughter)

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.822
I call it the Smart Dust Navy.

00:20:49.846 --> 00:20:51.822
I tell young officers, "You may
command 500 ships in your career.

00:20:51.846 --> 00:20:55.846
Bad news is they may not
have anybody on them."

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.846
Carriers go both ways
because they're a swing asset.

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:03.822
You'll see the pattern --
airborne, just like carriers.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.822
Armor goes this way.

00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:06.822
Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force,

00:21:06.846 --> 00:21:08.822
you can win by bombing.

00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:11.846
But you need lots of these guys
on the ground to win the peace.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.870
Shinseki was right with the argument.

00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:19.822
Air force, strategic
airlift goes both ways.

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:23.846
Bombers, fighters go over here.

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:26.822
Special Operations Command down at Tampa.

00:21:26.846 --> 00:21:29.846
Trigger-pullers go this way.

00:21:30.846 --> 00:21:33.822
Civil Affairs, that bastard
child, comes over here.

00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:35.822
Return to the Army.

00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:39.037
The point about the trigger-pullers
and Special Operations Command.

00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:41.157
No off season, these
guys are always active.

00:21:41.846 --> 00:21:47.822
They drop in, do
their business, disappear.

00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:49.822
See me now. Don't talk about it later.

00:21:49.846 --> 00:21:53.822
(Laughter)

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:55.822
I was never here.

00:21:55.846 --> 00:21:58.822
(Laughter)

00:21:58.846 --> 00:22:00.822
The world is my playground.

00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:04.822
(Laughter)

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:06.822
I want to keep trigger-pullers
trigger-happy.

00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:08.942
I want the rules to be
as loose as possible.

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:11.252
Because when the thing
gets prevented in Chicago

00:22:11.276 --> 00:22:12.822
with the three million dead

00:22:12.846 --> 00:22:15.608
that perverts our political
system beyond all recognition,

00:22:15.632 --> 00:22:18.109
these are the guys who are going
to kill them first.

00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:20.299
So it's better off to have them
make some mistakes along the way

00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:21.822
than to see that.

00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:23.822
Reserve component --

00:22:23.846 --> 00:22:26.822
National Guard reserves
overwhelmingly Sys Admin.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.822
How are you going to get
them to work for this force?

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:30.942
Most firemen in this
country do it for free.

00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:32.822
This is not about money.

00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:35.846
This is about being up front
with these guys and gals.

00:22:37.846 --> 00:22:39.822
Last point, intelligence community --

00:22:39.846 --> 00:22:43.822
the muscle and the defense
agencies go this way.

00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:46.822
What should be the CIA, open,
analytical, open source

00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:48.822
should come over here.

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:51.822
The information you need
to do this is not secret.

00:22:51.846 --> 00:22:53.822
It's not secret.

00:22:53.846 --> 00:22:54.822
Read that great piece in the New Yorker

00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:57.822
about how our echo boomers,
19 to 25, over in Iraq

00:22:57.846 --> 00:23:00.822
taught each other
how to do Sys Admin work,

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:02.822
over the Internet in chat rooms.

00:23:02.846 --> 00:23:04.822
They said, "Al Qaeda could be listening."

00:23:04.846 --> 00:23:07.466
They said, "Well, Jesus,
they already know this stuff."

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.822
(Laughter)

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:11.822
Take a gift in the left hand.

00:23:11.846 --> 00:23:15.846
These are the sunglasses that don't
scare people, simple stuff.

00:23:17.846 --> 00:23:20.822
Censors and transparency,
the overheads go in both directions.

00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:21.996
Thanks.
