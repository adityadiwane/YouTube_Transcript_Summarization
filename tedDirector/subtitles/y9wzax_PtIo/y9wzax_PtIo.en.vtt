00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:16.546
I love paper, and I love technology,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.877
and what I do is I make paper interactive.

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:22.330
And that's what I say when
people ask me what I do,

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.229
but it really confuses most people,

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.408
so really, the best way
for me to convey it

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.420
is to take the technology and be creative

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.521
and create experiences.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.773
So I tried to think
what I could use for here,

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:35.893
and a couple of weeks
ago I had a crazy idea

00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:39.706
that I wanted to print two DJ decks

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.190
and to try and mix some music.

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:44.405
And I'm going to try
and show that at the end,

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.914
and the suspense will be
as much mine if it works.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.580
And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:53.303
so I'm a little bit scared of that.

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:58.840
So I think, I found the best
way to describe my journey

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.490
is just to mention a few little things

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:02.590
that have happened to me
throughout my life.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:04.872
There's three particular
things that I've done,

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.563
and I'll just describe those first,

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:08.582
and then talk about some of my work.

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.811
So when I was a kid,
I was obsessed with wires,

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:14.917
and I used to thread them under my carpet

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.510
and thread them behind the walls

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:18.832
and have little switches
and little speakers,

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:21.548
and I wanted to make
my bedroom be interactive

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:23.078
but kind of all hidden away.

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:27.119
And I was also really
interested in wireless as well.

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.763
So I bought one of those
little kits that you could get

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:31.348
to make a radio transmitter,

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:34.613
and I got an old book
and I carved out the inside

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.483
and I hid it inside there,

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:38.890
and then I placed it next to my dad

00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:42.968
and snuck back to my bedroom
and tuned in on the radio

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:44.696
so I could eavesdrop.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.101
I was not at all interested
in what he was saying.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:48.939
It's more that I just liked the idea

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:50.453
of an everyday object

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.734
having something inside

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:55.136
and doing something different.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.802
Several year later,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:02:00.025
I managed to successfully
fail all of my exams

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.750
and didn't really leave school
with much to show for at all,

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:08.308
and my parents, maybe as a reward,

00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:10.168
bought me what turned out to be

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:11.878
a one-way ticket to Australia,

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.320
and I came back home
about four years later.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:19.302
I ended up on a farm
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.750
It was in far western New South Wales.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.501
And this farm was 120,000 acres.

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:26.294
There were 22,000 sheep,

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:28.208
and it was about 40 degrees,

00:02:28.232 --> 00:02:30.862
or 100 or so Fahrenheit.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:33.896
And on this farm there
was the farmer, his wife,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.607
and there was the four-year-old daughter.

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:39.229
And they kind of took me into the farm

00:02:39.253 --> 00:02:42.002
and showed me what it
was like to live and work.

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:44.788
Obviously, one of the most important
things was the sheep,

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:47.725
and so my job was, well,
pretty much to do everything,

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.125
but it was about bringing
the sheep back to the homestead.

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.116
And we'd do that by building fences,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.670
using motorbikes and horses,

00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:58.123
and the sheep would make
their way all the way back

00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:01.930
to the shearing shed
for the different seasons.

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:03.838
And what I learned was,

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:05.934
although at the time, like everyone else,

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.578
I thought sheep were pretty stupid

00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:09.286
because they didn't do
what we wanted them to do,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.407
what I realize now, probably
only just in the last few weeks

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.438
looking back, is the sheep
weren't stupid at all.

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:16.870
We'd put them in an environment
where they didn't want to be,

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.418
and they didn't want to do
what we wanted them to do.

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:21.832
So the challenge was to try and get them

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:22.854
to do what we wanted them to do

00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:25.945
by listening to the weather,
the lay of the land,

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.956
and creating things
that would let the sheep flow

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.654
and go where we wanted them to go.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.261
Another bunch of years later,

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:35.620
I ended up at Cambridge University

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:37.802
at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:39.516
doing a Ph.D. in physics.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.540
My Ph.D. was to move electrons
around, one at a time.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:47.196
And I realize — again, it's kind
of these realizations

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.395
looking back as to what I did —

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.326
I realize now that it
was pretty much the same

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.163
as moving sheep around.

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:56.437
It really is.

00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:59.293
It's just you do it
by changing an environment.

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:01.344
And that's kind
of been a big lesson to me,

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:02.940
that you can't act on any object.

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:05.488
You change its environment,
and the object will flow.

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:07.530
So we made it very small,

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:10.418
so things were about 30
nanometers in size;

00:04:10.442 --> 00:04:15.213
making it very cold, so
at liquid helium temperatures;

00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:18.273
and changing environment
by changing the voltage,

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:21.737
and the electrons could
make flow around a loop

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.374
one at a time, on and off,
a little memory node.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.310
And I wanted to go one step further,

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:28.493
and I wanted to move one electron on

00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:30.428
and one electron off.

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:33.290
And I was told that I wouldn't
be able to do this,

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.304
which, you know, as we've heard
from other people,

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:37.138
that's the thing that makes you do it.

00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:40.676
And I was determined, and I managed
to show that I could do that.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.415
And a lot of that learning, I think,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.920
came from being on that farm,

00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:45.945
because when I was working on the farm,

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.973
we'd have to use what was around us,

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:49.766
we'd have to use the environment,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.640
and there was no such thing

00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:52.950
as something can't be done,

00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:54.832
because you're in an environment where,

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:57.045
if you can't do what you need to do,

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.655
you can die, and, you know,

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:02.385
I had seen that sort of thing happen.

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.995
So now my obsession is printing,

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:07.812
and I'm really fascinated by the idea

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:10.756
of using conventional printing processes,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.981
so the types of print
that are used to create

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:14.339
many of the things around us

00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:18.104
to make paper and card interactive.

00:05:18.128 --> 00:05:20.225
When I spoke to some printers
when I started doing this

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.869
and told them what I wanted to do,

00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:24.095
which was to print
conductive inks onto paper,

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:25.691
they told me it couldn't be done,

00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:27.937
again, that kind of favorite thing.

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.643
So I got about 10 credit cards and loans

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:36.141
and got myself very close
to bankruptcy, really,

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:38.234
and bought myself this
huge printing press,

00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:40.358
which I had no idea how to use at all.

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.889
It was about five meters long,

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.147
and I covered myself
and the floor with ink

00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:47.435
and made a massive mess,
but I learned to print.

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.964
And then I took it back to the printers
and showed them what I've done,

00:05:49.988 --> 00:05:52.179
and they were like, "Of
course you can do that.

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.383
Why didn't you come here
in the first place?"

00:05:54.407 --> 00:05:57.353
That's always the case.

00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:01.140
So what we do is we take
conventional printing presses,

00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:03.095
we make conductive inks,

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.588
and run those through a press,
and basically

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:09.940
just letting hundreds
of thousands of electrons flow

00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:11.311
through pieces of paper

00:06:11.335 --> 00:06:13.300
so we can make that paper interactive.

00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:14.801
And it's pretty simple, really.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:17.664
It's just a collection of things
that have been done before,

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.879
but bringing them together
in a different way.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:22.503
So we have a piece of paper
with conductive ink on,

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:27.116
and then add onto that a small circuit
board with a couple of chips,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.182
one to run some capacitive touch software,

00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:30.826
so we know where we've touched it,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.364
and the other to run, quite often,

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:37.327
some wireless software so
the piece of paper can connect.

00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:40.734
So I'll just describe a couple
of things that we've created.

00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:42.997
There's lots of different
things we've created.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.438
This is one of them, because I love cake.

00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:48.130
And this one, it's a large poster,

00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:50.368
and you touch it and it has
a little speaker behind it,

00:06:50.392 --> 00:06:52.606
and the poster talks
to you when you touch it

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.297
and asks you a series of questions,

00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.311
and it works out your perfect cake.

00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:58.707
But it doesn't tell you
the cake there and then.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:00.305
It uploads a picture,

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:02.703
and the reason why it
chose that cake for you,

00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:05.926
to our Facebook page and to Twitter.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.753
So we're trying to create that connection

00:07:08.777 --> 00:07:10.539
between the physical and the digital,

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.577
but have it not looking on a screen,

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:15.700
and just looking like a regular poster.

00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:20.436
We've worked with a bunch
of universities on a project

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.413
looking at interactive newsprint.

00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:24.554
So for example, we've created a newspaper,

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:25.869
a regular newspaper.

00:07:25.893 --> 00:07:28.854
You can wear a pair of headphones
that are connected to it wirelessly,

00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:31.021
and when you touch it,
you can hear the music

00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:34.045
that's described on the top,
which is something you can't read.

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.211
You can hear a press conference

00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:38.755
as well as reading
what the editor has determined

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.303
that press conference was about.

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.440
And you can press a Facebook "like" button

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:45.119
or you can vote on something as well.

00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:46.358
Something else that we created,

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.622
and this was an idea that I had
a couple of years ago,

00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:49.691
and so we've done a project on this.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:51.732
It was for funding from the government

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:55.262
for user-centered design
for energy-efficient buildings,

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:57.296
difficult to say, and something
I had no idea what it was

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.080
when I went into the workshop,
but quickly learned.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.243
And we wanted to try and encourage people

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:04.091
to use energy better.

00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:07.613
And I really liked the idea that,
instead of looking at dials

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:10.159
and reading things to say --

00:08:10.183 --> 00:08:12.101
looking at your energy usage,

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.355
I wanted to create a poster
that was wirelessly connected

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.999
and had color-changing inks on it,

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:20.575
and so if your energy usage
was trending better,

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.902
than the leaves would appear
and the rabbits would appear

00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:24.288
and all would be good.

00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:26.312
And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti

00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:28.241
and the leaves would fall off the trees.

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:30.731
So it was trying to make
you look after something

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.856
in your immediate environment,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.345
which you don't want to see
not looking so good,

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.472
rather than expecting people to do things

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:39.783
in the local environment
because of the effect

00:08:39.807 --> 00:08:41.262
that it has a long way off.

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.620
And I think, kind of like going
back to the farm,

00:08:43.644 --> 00:08:46.648
it's about how to let people
do what you want them to do

00:08:46.672 --> 00:08:51.065
rather than making people do
what you want them to do.

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:52.525
Okay.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:55.347
So this is the bit I'm really scared of.

00:08:55.371 --> 00:08:57.586
So a couple of things I've created are,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.003
there's a poster over here

00:08:59.027 --> 00:09:01.434
that you can play drums on.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:06.181
And I am not a musician. It seemed
like a good idea at the time.

00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:08.953
If anyone wants to try
and play drums, then they can.

00:09:08.977 --> 00:09:10.597
I'll just describe how this works.

00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.591
This poster is wirelessly
connected to my cell phone,

00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:17.467
and when you touch it,
it connects to the app.

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:24.157
(Drums)

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:27.598
And it has really good response time.

00:09:27.622 --> 00:09:31.828
It's using Bluetooth 4, so
it's pretty instantaneous.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.880
Okay. Thanks.

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:38.620
(Applause)

00:09:39.168 --> 00:09:40.930
And there's a couple of other things.

00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:43.462
So this one is like a sound board,

00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:48.072
so you can touch it, and I just
love these horrible noises.

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:52.116
(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:58.661
Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.

00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:01.118
So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:05.755
and this is a software
that's running on the iPad.

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:09.379
Oh, yes. I just love doing that.

00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:12.403
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just
always wanted to do that.

00:10:12.427 --> 00:10:14.804
(Scratching)

00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:19.697
So I have a crossfader,
and I have the two decks.

00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:22.052
So I've made some new technology,

00:10:22.076 --> 00:10:23.648
and I love things being creative,

00:10:23.672 --> 00:10:25.577
and I love working with creative people.

00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:28.249
So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,

00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:29.269
and she's called Charlotte,

00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:31.455
and I asked her to record something,

00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:33.384
and I worked with a friend called Elliot

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:34.901
to put some beats together.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.961
So this is my niece, Charlotte.

00:10:36.985 --> 00:10:47.530
(Music)

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:12.332
Yay!

00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:21.398
(Applause)

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:23.470
So that's pretty much what I do.

00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:25.126
I just love bringing technology together,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.067
having a lot of fun, being creative.

00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:28.815
But it's not about the technology.

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:31.679
It's just about, I want to create
some great experiences.

00:11:31.703 --> 00:11:33.079
So thank you very much.

00:11:33.103 --> 00:11:38.119
(Applause)
