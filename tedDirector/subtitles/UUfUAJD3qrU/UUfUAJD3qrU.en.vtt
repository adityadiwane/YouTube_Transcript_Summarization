00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a great honor to be here with you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The good news is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but I have a box of slides.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I've learned through experience

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The whole story really starts

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And on a Wednesday afternoon,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I was walking down the corridor of my high school

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
who made a great big old ceramic vessel,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So, I walked in the art room and I said, "What is that?"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And he said, "Ceramics. And who are you?"

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I said, "I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And so for the remaining two years of my high school,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I cut all my classes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
(Laughter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But I had the presence of mind

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and they gave me passing grades.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that's how I got out of high school.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And Mr. Ross said,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
"You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, I'm now a trustee of the university,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and at my installation ceremony I said,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
who got into the place on probation.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Don't give up on the poor kids, because you never know

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
what's going to happen to those children in life."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
with the highest crime rate.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Well, we don't make any steel anymore,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and the people who used to make the steel

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
are having a very tough time of it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I rebuild them and give them new life.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I was adopted

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and he donated a row house. And in that row house

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there's money in very close proximity.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
(Laughter)

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And last year I spoke at his memorial service

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and wished him well in this life.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and I asked him to build me a world class center

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
That's the building.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
My view is that if you want to involve yourself

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in the life of people who have been given up on,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you have to look like the solution and not the problem.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Laughter)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and it sets an attitude and expectation

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So, from that fountain I built this building.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because I raised all the money.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I said to my boy, "When you raise the money,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we'll put your taste on the wall."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and everywhere your eye turns,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
there's something beautiful looking back at you,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that's deliberate.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That's intentional.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In my view, it is this kind of world

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that can redeem the soul of poor people.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We also created a boardroom,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We have since spun him off into his own business.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and single parents deserved to come to a school

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
long before you give them the speech.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Those are real and they're in my building every day.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And now that I've given lots of speeches,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and they said, "Mr. Strickland,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
what an extraordinary story and what a great school.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And we were particularly touched by the flowers

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there."

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
What you need to know is that the children

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and the adults deserve flowers in their life.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we believe in hope and human possibilities.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
That happens to be at Christmas time.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that was built by the Heinz company -- you've heard of them?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They did all right in the ketchup business.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I happen to know that company pretty well

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
who was tragically killed in a plane accident --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
he had heard about my desire to build a new building,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And he called me into his office --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
(Laughter) --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And he said, "But we've heard about you.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And you could do us a great service

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
if you would add a culinary program to your program."

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Because back then, we were building a trades program.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
for the Heinz company."

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that I don't know much about, but I promise you

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and in a couple of years, I'll come back

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and weigh out that program that you desire."

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
"Well, what would your reaction be

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
if I said I'd give you a million dollars?"

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I said, "Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business."

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Laughter)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And most importantly,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And we've never looked back.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I would like to show you now some of the food

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
That happens to be our cafeteria line.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
That's puff pastry day. Why?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Because the students made puff pastry

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and that's what the school ate every day.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That good food's not for rich people --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
good food's for everybody on the planet,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
but it's better for their heads.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that they have value at this place I call my center.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
by creating a world class environment,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
if you treat them in that way.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
after six months in the training program.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
is they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's all in the way that you think about people

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that often determines their behavior.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
That was done by a student after seven months in the program,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
done by a very brilliant young woman

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
who was taught by our pastry chef.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
(Laughter)

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
They have no calories.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
That's our dining room.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It looks like your average high school cafeteria

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in your average town in America.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
particularly once they have been pushed aside.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we train medical technicians for the medical industry,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and we train chemical technicians for companies

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and you're all invited --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
with logarithmic calculators

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
10 months from enrolling in the program.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
There is absolutely no reason why poor people

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
can't learn world class technology.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We even teach people how to read.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
he's now an instructor.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And so you must ask yourself the question:

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
how is it possible in the 21st century

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that we graduate children from schools

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I can take these children and in 20 weeks,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
No big deal.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
That's our library with more handcrafted furniture.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And this is the arts program I started in 1968.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Remember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
with other kids in the neighborhood,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
you can bring them right back to life.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
that come to me every day of the week for arts education.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And these are children who are flunking out of public school.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We've made a fascinating discovery:

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
there's nothing wrong with the kids

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and Herbie's music can't cure.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I beat out all the Ph.D.'s

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
because I figured that if you treat children like human beings,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And why we can't institute that policy

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
in every school and in every city and every town

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
remains a mystery to me.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Let me show you what these people do.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and what we've learned

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
is that the children will become like the people who teach them.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
an African-American woman

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and let me show you what they did with the work.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
These were children who the whole world had given up on,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
who were flunking out of public school,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and that's what they're capable of doing

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
We teach photography.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And these are examples of some of the kids' work.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
That boy won a four-year scholarship

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
on the strength of that photograph.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is our gallery.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We have a world class gallery

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
so I designed this thing.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
We have smoked salmon at the art openings,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we have a formal printed invitation,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
He was dragging guys out of bars

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and saving those lives for the Lord.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
but keep the enthusiasm.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I can't get these parents to come to the school."

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
He said, "I'll get them to come to the school."

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
"Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
but you probably didn't have a ride.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So, I came to give you a ride."

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and we didn't pick up one parent.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
because people think you're bad parents.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And there is no statistical difference

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
between the white parents and the black parents.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
every time, every town, every city.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
they've got four shows on their resume

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
before they apply to college because it's all up here.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
You have to change the way that people see themselves

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
before you can change their behavior.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And it's worked out pretty good up to this day.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
This is brand new.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
and I did all right.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And the woman came out of the audience,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
she said, "That was a great story

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and I was very impressed with your presentation.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old."

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?"

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?"

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
She said, "Yes, sir."

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem."

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and a furniture company called Steelcase

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and all their furniture for the United States of America.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And that's the room

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that's initiating the relationship.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
We got it just done in time to show you,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
(Applause)

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
(Music)

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I only have a couple more slides,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
on the north end of the building while I was building it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
"Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
that doesn't even have a reputation in music?"

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
He said, "Because I heard you built the center

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
and I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And now that I have, I want to give you a gift."

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I said, "You're the gift."

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And I'm going to allow you to record the concert

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and I'm going to give you the music,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
that says the money will come back and support the school."

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And he showed up and said,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
"Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and I want to help you."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Then a bass player named Ray Brown,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and a fellow named Tito Puente,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I have now accumulated 600 recordings

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
of the greatest artists in the world,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
including Joe Williams, who died,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
but not before his last recording was done at my school.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000
and he said, "God's picked you, man, to do this work.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And I want my music to be with you."

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And that worked out all right.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
they voted to give me the rights to the music.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
because I didn't think we were going to win.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Well, we did win,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
in the United States of America

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
(Laughter)

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
That's the place all filled up with Republicans.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
(Laughter)

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
(Applause)

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
because it was all sitting there.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Including my mother and father, who lived long enough

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
to see their kid build that building.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And he was there, Tito Puente.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
and they recorded with us.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and that's where we recorded the first Grammy.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000
who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
singing excerpts from this album,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
the rights to which she donated to our school.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
(Laughter)

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
right behind Tony Bennett.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And I think we're going to be fine.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
and so I had another cardboard box built

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
and I walked back out in the streets again.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And that's the building, and that's the model,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
and in the middle's the medical technology building.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
triple that in the middle of the inner city.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And there's the fountain.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
(Laughter)

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Every building has a fountain.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
and they took half the building,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and we now train medical technicians through all their system.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And Mellon Bank's a tenant.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And I love them because they pay the rent on time.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
(Laughter)

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And as a result of the association,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
that bought Dreyfus.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And this is in the process of being built as we speak.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
that's going to open in October this year

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
because we're going to grow those flowers

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
in the middle of the inner city.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And we're going to have high school kids

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
who are Hispanic.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And I told my United States senator

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
that there was a very high probability

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
that if he could find some funding for this,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
to which he readily agreed.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And we got the funding and we open in the fall.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And you ought to come and see it -- it's going to be a hell of a story.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And this is what I want to do when I grow up.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
(Laughter)

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
for four million dollars and I didn't do it.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And I built the first building, and guess what happened?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
and said, "Mr. Strickland,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
because you've appreciated our property values

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
beyond our wildest expectations.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Thank you very much for that."

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
just in case they do come true.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And finally, there's this picture.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
This is in a place called San Francisco.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And the reason this picture's in here is

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
He said, "Man, that's a great story.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
I want one of those."

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?"

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
He says, "I run the city of San Francisco.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
My name's Willie Brown."

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
and put it out of my mind.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And that weekend, I was going back home

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
first time I'd met him.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And he walked in and he says, "What is this?"

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
for poor people."

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And he said, "As God as my witness,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And now I really want to build one."

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I said, "Well, where would you build this thing?"

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
He said, "San Francisco."

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?"

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
(Laughter)

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And Willie Brown said, "As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I'm going to build this thing

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
as a legacy to the poor people of this city."

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
and we got an architect and we got a general contractor

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and we got Herbie on the board,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
and Genentech.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And along the way, I met this real short guy

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
at my slide show in the Silicon Valley.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
He came up to me afterwards,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
I want to help you."

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And I said, "Well, thank you very much for that.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
What do you do for a living?"

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
He said, "Well, I built a company called eBay."

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I said, "Well, that's very nice.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk."

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
but I had the presence of mind to go back

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
I said, "Hey man, what is eBay?"

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network."

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
and he left me his card."

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So, I called him up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Skoll,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
(Laughter)

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
and I'd like to become your friend."

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
(Laughter)

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And Jeff and I did become friends,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
and he's organized a team of people

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
and we're going to build this center.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and I said, "The mayor sent me down here to work with you

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
and I want to build a center with you,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And all I've got is a box of slides."

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
and it was 100 degrees outside,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
and I started showing these pictures.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And I ran the story and I said, "What do you think?"

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
"In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I'm going with you, man."

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And she turned that audience around on a pin.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
and we're going to build it all right.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
And I think we can get in the ground this year

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
and I showed him the box of slides.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And Quincy said, "I want to help you, man.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Let's do one in L.A."

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And so he's assembled a group of people.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And I've fallen in love with him,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
as I have with Herbie and with his music.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And I said, "It came from your music, man.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
when I was 16 years old in the pottery class,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
when the world was all dark,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
and your music got me to the sunlight."

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And I said, "If I can follow that music,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
And if that's not true, how did I get here?"

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I want you all to know

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
that I think the world is a place that's worth living.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I believe in you.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
I believe in your hopes and your dreams,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I believe in your intelligence

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
and I believe in your enthusiasm.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And I'm tired of living like this,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
going into town after town with people standing around on corners

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
most of whom look like me.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
It's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
It's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Do the math -- it will never work.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I am banking on you

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
and very decent people who still believe in something.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And I don't think I'm crazy.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I think we can get home on this thing

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
and I think we can build these all over the country

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
for less money than we're spending on prisons.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And I believe we can turn this whole story around

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
to one of celebration and one of hope.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
In my business it's very difficult work.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon --

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
never enough money, too much need --

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
and so there is a tendency

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
And thanks for listening to what I had to say.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:22.000
(Applause)
