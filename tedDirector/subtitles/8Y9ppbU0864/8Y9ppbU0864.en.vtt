00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
through a desolate countryside.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
by being the first to conquer outer space.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
The rocket was huge.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And packed in its nose was a silver ball

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
with two radios inside.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
"We are about to create a new planet

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
that we will call Sputnik.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
In the olden days, explorers

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
like Vasco da Gama and Columbus

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
which is just about completed.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
It tells the story of Sputnik,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
and the story of what happened to America as a result.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
For days after the launch,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
it inspired awe and pride

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
that humans had finally launched an object into space.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
the media and the politicians told us,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and we believed, that Sputnik was proof

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
that our enemy had beaten us

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
in science and technology,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
All hell broke loose.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America --

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
It provoked the missile gap.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
It exploded an arms race.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
It began the space race.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
to 20,000.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
For example, some here will remember

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
this day, June 1958,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
the National Civil Defense Drill,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
believed that a nuclear war would happen,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and that at least 50 percent of our population

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
was going to be killed.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
because of Sputnik.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Support for engineering, math and science --

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
education in general -- boomed.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
led directly to ARPA, and the Internet,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
and, of course, NASA.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
My feature documentary shows how a free society

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
But it also shows how we can turn

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
what appears at first to be a bad situation,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
into something that was overall very good for America.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
"Sputnik" will soon be released.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
one of my investors:

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And I'd like to thank you all.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
(Applause).

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Thank you, Chris.
