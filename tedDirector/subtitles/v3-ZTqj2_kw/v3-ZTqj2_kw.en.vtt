00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
for his storytelling,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but even more, I think,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
for the beauty and precision of his prose.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
or the fantastical stream of consciousness

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
in "Autumn of the Patriarch,"

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
where the words rush by,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
page after page of unpunctuated imagery

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
sweeping the reader along

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
like some wild river

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
twisting through a primal South American jungle,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
reading Márquez is a visceral experience.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Which struck me as particularly remarkable

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
during one session with the novel

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
when I realized that I was being swept along

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
on this remarkable, vivid journey

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in translation.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Now I was a comparative literature major in college,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
which is like an English major,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
we got to read great literature in translation

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
from around the world.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And as great as these books were,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
you could always tell

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that you were getting close to the full effect.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
But not so with Márquez

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
who once praised his translator's versions

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
as being better than his own,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
which is an astonishing compliment.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
had written his own book on the subject,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I couldn't wait to read it.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
It's called apropos of the Italian adage

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that I lifted from his forward,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
"If This Be Treason."

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And it's a charming read.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
in the translator's art.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
But the reason that I mention it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
is that early on, Rabassa offers

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
this elegantly simple insight:

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
"Every act of communication

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is an act of translation."

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
but for me,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
as often as I'd encountered

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that exact difficulty on a daily basis,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
in so crystalline a light.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Ever since I can remember

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
thinking consciously about such things,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
communication has been my central passion.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Even as a child,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
was to be able to understand everything

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and then to communicate it to everyone else.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So no ego problems.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
It's funny, my wife, Daisy,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
whose family is littered with schizophrenics --

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and I mean littered with them --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.260
once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
I don't need a husband who wants to be."

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
(Laughter)

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
ever more aware of how unobtainable

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the first part of my childhood ambition was,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
it was that second part,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
being able to successfully communicate to others

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
whatever knowledge I was gaining,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
where the futility of my quest really set in.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Time after time,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
whenever I set out to share some great truth

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
with a soon-to-be grateful recipient,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
it had the opposite effect.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
"Hey, listen up,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
it's amazing how quickly you'll discover

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
both ice and the firing squad.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Finally, after about 10 years

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
of alienating friends and strangers alike,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I finally got it,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
a new personal truth all my own,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the ideas that I was gaining,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
I'd better find a different way of going about it.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And that's when I discovered comedy.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
from other forms of language.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I'd say it falls somewhere

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
between poetry and lies.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And I'm not talking about all comedy here,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because, clearly, there's plenty of humor

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
What I want to talk about

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
comedy as the philosopher's stone.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and transforms it through ridicule

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
into a different way of seeing

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and ultimately being in the world.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Because that's what I take

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
That it's about communication

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that doesn't just produce greater understanding

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
within the individual,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
but leads to real change.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Which in my experience means communication

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that manages to speak to and expand

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
our concept of self-interest.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
because we're all wired for that.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It's part of our survival package,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and that's why it's become so important for us,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and that's why we're always listening at that level.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And also because that's where,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
in terms of our own self-interest,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
we finally begin to grasp

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
our ability to respond, our responsibility

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
to the rest of the world.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
I mean work that comes first and foremost

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
from a place of honesty and integrity.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Now if you think back

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Sarah Palin,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
they were devastating.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
cementing an impression

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that the majority of the American public still holds today.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And the key detail of this

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and they weren't written by the SNL writers.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
They were lifted verbatim

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
from Palin's own remarks.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
(Laughter)

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Here was a Palin impersonator

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
quoting Palin word for word.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Now that's honesty and integrity,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and it's also why Fey's performances

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
left such a lasting impression.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
On the other side of the political spectrum,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I knew that he'd made a direct hit.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Now it's not often that I'm going to associate

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
The description perfectly captured

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Edwards' personal vanity.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And guess what?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
That ended up being the exact personality trait

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
is by far the most --

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.260
(Applause)

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
(Laughter)

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
it's by far the most well-documented example

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Survey after survey,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
(Applause)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Now whether this says more

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
about the conflict between integrity and profitability

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
of corporate journalism

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
the larger point remains

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
that Stewart's material

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
not because his intent is to inform. It's not.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
His intent is to be funny.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
doesn't work unless the facts are true.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the result is great comedy

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
that's also an information delivery system

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
than the professional news media.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Now this is doubly ironic

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
when you consider that what gives comedy its edge

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
at reaching around people's walls

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
where you think it's going over here

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And there's this mental delight

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that's followed by the physical response of laughter,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
which, not coincidentally,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
releases endorphins in the brain.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And just like that, you've been seduced

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
into a different way of looking at something

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
This is the exact opposite

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
of the way that anger and fear and panic,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
which throws our walls up sky-high.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And the comedy comes along,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
dealing with a lot of the same areas

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
where our defenses are the strongest --

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
race, religion, politics, sexuality --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
we get endorphins

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Now let me give you an example from my act.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
I have some material

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
about the so-called radical gay agenda,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
which starts off by asking,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
how radical is the gay agenda?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
are to join the military, get married and start a family.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
(Laughter)

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
(Laughter)

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
(Laughter)

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And that's followed by these lines

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
about gay adoption:

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
What is the problem with gay adoption?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Why is this remotely controversial?

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
(Laughter)

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
You have given birth to an abomination.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Remove it from your household.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
this joke short circuits the emotional wiring

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
behind the debate

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
to question its validity.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Misdirection isn't the only trick

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
that comedy has up its sleeve.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Economy of language

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
is another real strong suit of great comedy.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
There are few phrases

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
than the perfect punchline.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
you should really Google him --

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Hicks had a routine

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
where finally the other kid says to him,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
to which Hicks replies,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
"Really? How soon?"

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.260
(Laughter)

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
That's an entire childhood

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
in three words.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
(Laughter)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Not to mention what it reveals

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
about the adult who's speaking them.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And one last powerful attribute

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that comedy has as communication

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
is that it's inherently viral.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
People can't wait

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
to pass along that new great joke.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Comedy has been crossing country

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
with remarkable speed

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
way before the Internet, social media,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
even cable TV.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Back in 1980

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
during a freebasing accident,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
you'd find out that comedy

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
is the second oldest viral profession.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
First there were drums

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and then knock-knock jokes.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
(Laughter)

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
But it's when you put all of these elements together --

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
when you get the viral appeal of a great joke

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
with a powerful punchline

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that's crafted from honesty and integrity,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
it can have a real world impact

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
at changing a conversation.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
who's the editorial cartoonist

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
for the Lexington Herald-Leader.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
I was visiting with Joel

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in December of 2009.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And Joel was explaining to me

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
that, because USA Today

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
was one of America's four papers of record,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.260
it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
on Monday, the opening day of the conference,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
it could get passed around

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
at the highest level among actual decision-makers.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
So we started talking about climate change.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
And it turned out that Joel and I

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
were both bothered by the same thing,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
which was how so much of the debate

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
was still focused on the science

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and how complete it was or wasn't,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
which, to both of us,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
seems somewhat intentionally off point.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Because first of all, there's this false premise

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that such a thing as complete science exists.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
was pushing this same line this past summer

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260
at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
for the Republican presidential nomination,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
at the same time that 250

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
out of 254 counties in the state of Texas

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
were on fire.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And Perry's policy solution

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
was to ask the people of Texas

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
to pray for rain.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Personally, I was praying for four more fires

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
so we could finally complete the damn science.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.260
(Laughter)

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
But back in 2009,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
the question Joel and I kept turning over and over

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
was why this late in the game

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
so much energy was being spent talking about the science

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
when the policies necessary to address climate change

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.260
were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
regardless of the science.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
(Laughter)

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
You've got to love that idea.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:28.260
(Applause)

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Not for God, not for country, not for profit --

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.260
just as a basic metric for global decision-making.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Shortly after the conference was over,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
Joel got a request for a signed copy

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
from the head of the EPA in Washington

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
whose wall it now hangs on.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And not long after that, he got another request for a copy

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
from the head of the EPA in California

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
who used it as part of her presentation

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
at an international conference on climate change

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
in Sacramento last year.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And it didn't stop there.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
in the United States, Canada and Europe.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And earlier this year,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
he got a request from the Green Party in Australia

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
who used it in their campaign

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
where it became part of the debate

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
that resulted in the Australian parliament

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
of any country in the world.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.260
(Applause)

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
That is a lot of punch

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
for 14 words.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
So my suggestion to those of you out here

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
who are seriously focused on creating a better world

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
is to take a little bit of time each day

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and practice thinking funny,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Thank you.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
(Applause)
