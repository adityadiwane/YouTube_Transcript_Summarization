00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.936
Hannah is excited to be going to college.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.736
She couldn't wait
to get out of her parents' house,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.776
to prove to them that she's an adult,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.480
and to prove to her new friends
that she belongs.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.936
She heads to a campus party

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.496
where she sees a guy
that she has a crush on.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.880
Let's call him Mike.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.520
The next day, Hannah wakes up
with a pounding headache.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.960
She can only remember
the night in flashes.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.176
But what she does remember is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.040
throwing up in the hall
outside Mike's room

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.536
and staring at the wall silently
while he was inside her,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.840
wanting it to stop,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.480
then shakily stumbling home.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:56.856
She doesn't feel good about what happened,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.600
but she thinks, "Maybe this is just
what sex in college is?"

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.056
One in five women and one in 13 men
will be sexually assaulted

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.200
at some point during their college career
in the United States.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.936
Less than 10 percent will ever report
their assault to their school

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.456
or to the police.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.400
And those who do, on average,
wait 11 months to make the report.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.736
Hannah initially just feels like dealing
with what happened on her own.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.336
But when she sees Mike
taking girls home from parties,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.600
she's worried about them.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.856
After graduation, Hannah learns

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920
that she was one of five women
who Mike did the exact same thing to.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.256
And this is not an unlikely scenario

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.336
because 90 percent of sexual assaults

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.600
are committed by repeat offenders.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.816
But with such low reporting rates,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.656
it's fairly unlikely that even
repeat perpetrators will be reported,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.216
much less anything happen if they are.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.376
In fact, only six percent
of assaults reported to the police

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.280
end with the assailant
spending a single day in prison.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.480
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance
that they'll get away with it.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.816
This means there's practically
no deterrent to assault

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.320
in the United States.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.496
Now, I'm an infectious disease
epidemiologist by training.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.616
I'm interested in systems and networks

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640
and where we can concentrate
our resources to do the most good.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.320
So this, to me, is a tragic
but a solvable problem.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.416
So when the issue of campus assault
started hitting the news a few years ago,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.816
it felt like a unique opportunity
to make a change.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.040
And so we did.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.336
We started by talking
to college survivors.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.360
And what they wish they'd had
in college is pretty simple;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.416
they wanted a website,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.576
one they could use
at the time and place

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.040
that felt safest to them

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.776
with clearly written information
about their reporting options,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.936
with the ability to electronically
report their assault,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.576
rather than having the first step

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.480
to go in and talk to someone
who may or may not believe them.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.376
With the option to create
a secure, timestamped document

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.896
of what happened to them,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.960
preserving evidence
even if they don't want to report yet.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.536
And lastly, and perhaps most critically,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.576
with the ability to report their assault

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.240
only if someone else
reported the same assailant.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.056
You see, knowing that you weren't
the only one changes everything.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.416
It changes the way
you frame your own experience,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.896
it changes the way
you think about your perpetrator,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.736
it means that if you do come forward,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.800
you'll have someone else's back
and they'll have yours.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.336
We created a website
that actually does this

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.376
and we launched it [...] in August,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.000
on two college campuses.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.496
And we included a unique matching system

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.456
where if Mike's first victim
had come forward,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.256
saved her record,
entered into the matching system

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.536
and named Mike,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.936
and Mike's second victim
had done the same thing

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.616
a few months later,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.976
they would have matched

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.496
and the verified contact information
of both survivors

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.256
would have been sent
to the authorities at the same time

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.320
for investigation and follow up.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.296
If a system like this had existed
for Hannah and her peers,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.856
it's more likely
that they would have reported,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.656
that they would have been believed,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.936
and that Mike would have been
kicked off campus,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960
gone to jail, or at least
gotten the help that he needed.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.416
And if we were able to stop
repeat offenders like Mike

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.056
after just their second assault
following a match,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.696
survivors like Hannah
would never even be assaulted

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.000
in the first place.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.856
We could prevent
59 percent of sexual assaults

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.960
just by stopping
repeat perpetrators earlier on.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.776
And because we're creating
a real deterrent to assault,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.936
for perhaps the first time,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.320
maybe the Mikes of the world
would never even try to assault anyone.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.616
The type of system I'm describing,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.016
the type of system that survivors want

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.576
is a type of information escrow,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.816
meaning an entity that holds on
to information for you

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.296
and only releases it to a third party

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.896
when certain pre-agreed upon
conditions are met,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.120
such as a match.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.336
The application that we built
is for college campuses.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.416
But the same type of system
could be used in the military

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.840
or even the workplace.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.256
We don't have to live in a world

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.440
where 99 percent of rapists
get away with it.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.536
We can create one

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.496
where those who do wrong
are held accountable,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.936
where survivors get the support
and justice they deserve,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.856
where the authorities
get the information they need,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.776
and where there's a real deterrent

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.440
to violating the rights
of another human being.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.336
Thank you.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.320
(Applause)
