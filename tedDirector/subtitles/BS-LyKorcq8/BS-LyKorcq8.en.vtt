00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I started juggling a long time ago,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.330
but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330
And as a golfer and as a kid,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And it's the process of learning things.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
And he had a real passion for golf,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
and he also created this whole mythology

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
about Ben Hogan and various things.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.330
that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
And that was the mythology of skill.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.330
and basically visual music, I guess.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
OK, you can start the music, thanks.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:04:28.330
(Music)

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
(Applause)

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.330
Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
I do a big piece in a triangle

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and these are three sections from it.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
but using the rhythm of my body and feet,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
and controlling the balls with my feet.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
(Applause)

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.330
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
it's a process of joining with forces.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.330
And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
how to join with the space through the technique.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.330
So juggling gravity -- up, down.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
If you figure out what up and down really are,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
it's a complex physical set of skills

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
but then you add in sideways.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.330
(Applause)

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.330
Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
because you're not looking at your hands,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.330
So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
with the obvious reference to the feet,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.330
but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:35.330
(Applause)

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.330
Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
I'm going to build towards complexity now.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
Juggling three balls is simple and normal.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
(Laughter)

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
Excuse me.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
(Laughter)

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
you're getting into a subculture here.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.330
(Laughter)

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:24.330
Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
So, you've got to go after the space down there.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
OK, then you've got to combine them,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.330
because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
And then you get crazy.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
(Applause)

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.330
Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
so you've got to pay attention. Complexity:

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.330
if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
or your skill increases, so your perceptions change.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.330
It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.330
You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.330
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
OK? And whoever laughed there --

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
you understood it completely, right?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.330
(Laughter)

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
who's got his hands around that mess, OK.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
OK? Another way is the outside.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
And you could play with the rhythm.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Same pattern.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
Make it faster and smaller.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
Make it wider.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
Make it narrower.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Bring it back up.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
OK. It's done. Thanks.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
(Applause)

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:48.330
Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
but let's try something.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:01.330
OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
I'm going to give you a little clue.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
(Laughter)

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.330
You're not getting off that easy. All right?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.330
Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
Green.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Yellow.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Pink.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
White.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Now, let's actually learn something.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:51.330
Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
You want to do it? Yeah? OK.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.330
Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
What you're going to learn is this.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
(Laughter)

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Little, ring, middle, index. And then open.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
A little bit faster.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.330
(Laughter)

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.330
All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
(Laughter)

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
One learning process that I see is this --

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
(Laughter)

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.330
OK. Another learning process that I see is this --

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
(Laughter)

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.330
OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
Now, one more time, and --

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.330
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
Shake your hands out.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
and you're getting this. OK?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
So what I want you to do is -- fingers.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
But I want you to do is also, with your eyes,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
(Laughter)

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
OK? Here we go.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
and I'm going to tell you which color,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
So white ball and --

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.330
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:51.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.330
Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
All right.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
(Applause)

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.330
How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.330
because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
a moment of learning, a moment of challenge.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
It's a moment that you can't make sense of.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
Why the hell should I learn this? OK?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.330
(Laughter)

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
You know, what are you supposed to do?

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.330
You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
of doing that for his whole life. OK?

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
a moment. And what I do as a creative artist

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.330
is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
and I put the choreography together,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.330
but they're not original techniques.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
that come from the work that I've developed. OK?

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.330
So, a moment, how would you define a moment?

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.330
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:29.330
that was representational of a moment.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
Ahhh.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
So, a moment.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:45.330
(Rattling)

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.330
OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
OK, what can I do to make that something

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.330
that is dependent on something else, another dynamic.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:08.330
(Rattling)

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.330
So, a moment.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
(Rattling)

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
Another moment.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:23.330
(Rattling)

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:28.330
Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.330
(Rattling)

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:41.330
A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
Time. How can you look at time?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.330
And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.330
Well, obviously, there's something in here,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.330
and you can all have a guess as to what it is.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.330
There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.330
And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:07.330
And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.330
Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.330
because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
while I'm keeping time with this.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.330
(Applause)

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:26.330
All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.330
Are we ready to do that? Yes?

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
This is the piece that I told you about.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.330
It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.330
(Applause)

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.330
Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.330
you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.330
at 120 miles an hour?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.330
(Laughter)

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.330
The only other thing is, it was a real shock.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.330
I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.330
that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.330
Anyway, balance:

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:05.330
constant movement to find an approach to stillness.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.330
Cheating.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.330
(Laughter)

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.330
Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:24.330
so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:35.330
To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.330
(Laughter)

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.330
Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:46.330
and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.330
So, there's a rhythm to it.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.330
The rhythm can get much smaller.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:06.330
As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.330
those tinier movements. Thanks.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.330
(Applause)

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.330
Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:23.330
that is about balance in some ways, and also --

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:30.330
oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:39.330
(Laughter)

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.330
You can go with the "Sticks One" music.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:24:11.330
(Music)

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:18.330
(Applause)

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.330
Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:30.330
I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.330
And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.330
"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.330
Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:25:44.330
(Music)

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.330
(Applause)

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:53.330
Working with space and the lines in space in a different way.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.330
Oh, let's see here.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.330
(Applause)

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.330
So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.330
now, what if you attach something to it, or change it.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.330
This is a little thing that I made

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:48.330
because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:55.330
And then creating space and the rhythm of space,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.330
using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.330
Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.330
which is --

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:13.330
what have I got here? OK. All right.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.330
I'm actually leading up to something,

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.330
the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.330
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:20.330
(Applause)

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.330
Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.330
the diameter and the circumference.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.330
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.330
that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:37.330
Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.330
of objects that I try to work with.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.330
The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.330
if you want to get that up --

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:51.330
it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:56.330
which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:00.330
with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:04.330
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:08.330
and the stories that were involved in it,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.330
as well as the fact that they protected the contents.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.330
The second influence on this piece came from recycling

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.330
and looking into a tin can recycling bin

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.330
and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.330
So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:32:16.330
(Music)

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.330
(Applause)

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.330
Talking about geometry and everything,

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:28.330
if you take the circle and you split it in half --

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.330
can you run "S-Curve music?"

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.330
I'm going to do just a short version of it.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.330
Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:34:17.330
(Music)

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:24.330
(Applause)

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:29.330
Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.330
and I dance around a small stage so --

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.330
two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.330
what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.330
They're not ideas, they're instincts.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.330
And the latest thing that I'm working on --

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.330
(Clattering) --

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:56.330
is something really -- I don't know what it is yet.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:01.330
And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.330
Well, because then it tells me the truth,

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.330
instead of me imposing the truth.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.330
And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.330
but also with these curves.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.330
And what it involves,

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.330
and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.330
but I'll do a little bit of it.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.330
It initially started off with me stacking these things,

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:27.330
bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:34.330
of filling in the space. And then it started changing,

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.330
and become folding on themselves.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.330
And then changing levels.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.330
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.330
not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:04.330
For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.330
Now, I don't know exactly where it's going,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.330
but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.330
And it's going to change as I go through it.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.330
But I really like it, it feels right.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.330
This may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.330
and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.330
just to see, just to play,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.330
because I love all different kinds of things to play with.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.330
Let's see here.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.330
To work with the positive and negative in a different way.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.330
And to change, and to change.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.330
So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.330
We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:56.330
(Applause)
