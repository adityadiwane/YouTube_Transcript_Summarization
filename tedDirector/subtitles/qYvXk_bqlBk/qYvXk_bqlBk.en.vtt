00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:16.304
What an intriguing
group of individuals you are ...

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.953
to a psychologist.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.416
(Laughter)

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.546
I've had the opportunity
over the last couple of days

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.156
of listening in on some
of your conversations

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.150
and watching you interact with each other.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.699
And I think it's fair to say, already,

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:36.911
that there are 47 people in this audience,

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:38.712
at this moment,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:43.547
displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today.

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:44.918
(Laughter)

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:47.944
And I thought you might
like to know who you are.

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.391
(Laughter)

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.102
But instead of pointing at you,

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:54.324
which would be gratuitous and intrusive,

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:57.866
I thought I would tell you
a few facts and stories,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.927
in which you may catch
a glimpse of yourself.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.325
I'm in the field of research
known as personality psychology,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.789
which is part of a larger
personality science

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:14.922
which spans the full spectrum,
from neurons to narratives.

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:16.790
And what we try to do,

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.164
in our own way,

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.932
is to make sense of how each of us --

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:24.019
each of you --

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.545
is, in certain respects,

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.932
like all other people,

00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:30.377
like some other people

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:33.261
and like no other person.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.746
Now, already you may
be saying of yourself,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.515
"I'm not intriguing.

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:47.046
I am the 46th most boring person
in the Western Hemisphere."

00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:50.184
Or you may say of yourself,

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.115
"I am intriguing,

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:57.203
even if I am regarded by most people
as a great, thundering twit."

00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:58.417
(Laughter)

00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:04.301
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness
and your inherent "twitiness"

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:08.752
that makes me, as a psychologist,
really fascinated by you.

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:11.523
So let me explain why this is so.

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:16.445
One of the most influential approaches
in personality science

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.059
is known as trait psychology,

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:23.452
and it aligns you along five dimensions
which are normally distributed,

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:30.466
and that describe universally held aspects
of difference between people.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.708
They spell out the acronym OCEAN.

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:37.156
So, "O" stands for "open to experience,"

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.531
versus those who are more closed.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.730
"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:46.398
in contrast to those with a more
lackadaisical approach to life.

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:51.065
"E" -- "extroversion," in contrast
to more introverted people.

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.781
"A" -- "agreeable individuals,"

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:57.227
in contrast to those
decidedly not agreeable.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.243
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals,"

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.940
in contrast to those who are more stable.

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:07.658
All of these dimensions have
implications for our well-being,

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:10.188
for how our life goes.

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:13.111
And so we know that, for example,

00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:18.110
openness and conscientiousness
are very good predictors of life success,

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.206
but the open people achieve that success
through being audacious

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.408
and, occasionally, odd.

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:30.442
The conscientious people
achieve it through sticking to deadlines,

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:34.388
to persevering, as well as
having some passion.

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:39.548
Extroversion and agreeableness
are both conducive

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:42.150
to working well with people.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.854
Extroverts, for example,
I find intriguing.

00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:48.861
With my classes, I sometimes
give them a basic fact

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.852
that might be revealing
with respect to their personality:

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:57.402
I tell them that it is virtually
impossible for adults

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.263
to lick the outside of their own elbow.

00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:02.541
(Laughter)

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:03.949
Did you know that?

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:09.694
Already, some of you have tried
to lick the outside of your own elbow.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:11.494
But extroverts amongst you

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:14.129
are probably those
who have not only tried,

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.643
but they have successfully
licked the elbow

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:18.358
of the person sitting next to them.

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:19.384
(Laughter)

00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:21.093
Those are the extroverts.

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:24.536
Let me deal in a bit more detail
with extroversion,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.519
because it's consequential
and it's intriguing,

00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:31.024
and it helps us understand
what I call our three natures.

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:34.719
First, our biogenic nature --
our neurophysiology.

00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:37.726
Second, our sociogenic or second nature,

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.137
which has to do with the cultural
and social aspects of our lives.

00:04:42.744 --> 00:04:49.647
And third, what makes you
individually you -- idiosyncratic --

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.236
what I call your "idiogenic" nature.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.416
Let me explain.

00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:00.386
One of the things that characterizes
extroverts is they need stimulation.

00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:05.695
And that stimulation can be achieved
by finding things that are exciting:

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.756
loud noises, parties
and social events here at TED --

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.007
you see the extroverts
forming a magnetic core.

00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.690
They all gather together.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.129
And I've seen you.

00:05:16.153 --> 00:05:19.476
The introverts are more likely
to spend time in the quiet spaces

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.323
up on the second floor,

00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:25.139
where they are able
to reduce stimulation --

00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:29.098
and may be misconstrued
as being antisocial,

00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:32.120
but you're not necessarily antisocial.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.208
It may be that you simply realize
that you do better

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:41.847
when you have a chance
to lower that level of stimulation.

00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:47.146
Sometimes it's an internal
stimulant, from your body.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.085
Caffeine, for example, works much better
with extroverts than it does introverts.

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.288
When extroverts come into the office
at nine o'clock in the morning

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.197
and say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"

00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.372
they're not kidding --

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:00.569
they really do.

00:06:01.531 --> 00:06:03.337
Introverts do not do as well,

00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:05.878
particularly if the tasks
they're engaged in --

00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:08.458
and they've had some coffee --

00:06:08.482 --> 00:06:10.620
if those tasks are speeded,

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:12.523
and if they're quantitative,

00:06:12.547 --> 00:06:16.941
introverts may give the appearance
of not being particularly quantitative.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.220
But it's a misconstrual.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:22.288
So here are the consequences
that are really quite intriguing:

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:24.395
we're not always what seem to be,

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.703
and that takes me to my next point.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:30.752
I should say, before getting to this,

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:33.456
something about sexual intercourse,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.581
although I may not have time.

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:38.477
And so, if you would like me to --

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:39.652
yes, you would?

00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:40.827
OK.

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.936
(Laughter)

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.120
There are studies done

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:48.469
on the frequency with which
individuals engage in the conjugal act,

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.645
as broken down by male, female;
introvert, extrovert.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.251
So I ask you:

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:56.347
How many times per minute --

00:06:57.162 --> 00:06:59.046
oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.077
(Laughter)

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.953
How many times per month

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:09.974
do introverted men engage in the act?

00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:11.876
3.0.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.532
Extroverted men?

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:15.166
More or less?

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:17.244
Yes, more.

00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:19.974
5.5 -- almost twice as much.

00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:23.832
Introverted women: 3.1.

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.452
Extroverted women?

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:28.822
Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:30.583
which I will explain later --

00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:32.188
they are heroic.

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:34.748
7.5.

00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:38.134
They not only handle
all the male extroverts,

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.251
they pick up a few introverts as well.

00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:42.171
(Laughter)

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:44.515
(Applause)

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:53.097
We communicate differently,
extroverts and introverts.

00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:56.082
Extroverts, when they interact,

00:07:56.106 --> 00:08:00.571
want to have lots of social encounter
punctuated by closeness.

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:03.586
They'd like to stand close
for comfortable communication.

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:06.746
They like to have a lot of eye contact,

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.114
or mutual gaze.

00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:10.448
We found in some research

00:08:10.472 --> 00:08:13.470
that they use more diminutive terms
when they meet somebody.

00:08:13.873 --> 00:08:16.586
So when an extrovert meets a Charles,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.495
it rapidly becomes "Charlie,"
and then "Chuck,"

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:21.198
and then "Chuckles Baby."

00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:22.714
(Laughter)

00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:24.437
Whereas for introverts,

00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:29.366
it remains "Charles," until he's given
a pass to be more intimate

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.610
by the person he's talking to.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.829
We speak differently.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:42.171
Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
concrete, simple language.

00:08:43.854 --> 00:08:47.648
Introverts prefer --
and I must again tell you

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:52.029
that I am as extreme an introvert
as you could possibly imagine --

00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:54.570
we speak differently.

00:08:54.594 --> 00:08:58.589
We prefer contextually complex,

00:08:58.613 --> 00:09:00.545
contingent,

00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:02.585
weasel-word sentences --

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:03.632
(Laughter)

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:05.018
More or less.

00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:06.821
(Laughter)

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.045
As it were.

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.084
(Laughter)

00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:11.108
Not to put too fine a point upon it --

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:13.021
like that.

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:15.357
When we talk,

00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:17.123
we sometimes talk past each other.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.352
I had a consulting contract
I shared with a colleague

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:23.380
who's as different from me
as two people can possibly be.

00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:25.518
First, his name is Tom.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.713
Mine isn't.

00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:29.008
(Laughter)

00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:30.963
Secondly, he's six foot five.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.939
I have a tendency not to be.

00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:34.006
(Laughter)

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.753
And thirdly, he's as extroverted
a person as you could find.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.157
I am seriously introverted.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.365
I overload so much,

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:47.203
I can't even have a cup of coffee
after three in the afternoon

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:49.515
and expect to sleep in the evening.

00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:54.130
We had seconded to this project
a fellow called Michael.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.492
And Michael almost brought
the project to a crashing halt.

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:04.324
So the person who seconded him
asked Tom and me,

00:10:05.244 --> 00:10:06.703
"What do you make of Michael?"

00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:08.997
Well, I'll tell you
what Tom said in a minute.

00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:11.337
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:15.530
And here is how extroverted ears
heard what I said,

00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:17.507
which is actually pretty accurate.

00:10:17.531 --> 00:10:21.791
I said, "Well Michael does have
a tendency at times

00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:25.671
of behaving in a way
that some of us might see

00:10:26.489 --> 00:10:30.624
as perhaps more assertive
than is normally called for."

00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:33.251
(Laughter)

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:35.388
Tom rolled his eyes and he said,

00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:37.941
"Brian, that's what I said:

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:40.029
he's an asshole!"

00:10:40.053 --> 00:10:42.230
(Laughter)

00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:44.075
(Applause)

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:46.776
Now, as an introvert,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.981
I might gently allude to certain
"assholic" qualities

00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:53.300
in this man's behavior,

00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:56.128
but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.

00:10:56.152 --> 00:10:57.928
(Laughter)

00:10:59.228 --> 00:11:00.494
But the extrovert says,

00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:03.392
"If he walks like one, if he talks
like one, I call him one."

00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:04.828
And we go past each other.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:09.464
Now is this something
that we should be heedful of?

00:11:09.488 --> 00:11:10.654
Of course.

00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:12.262
It's important that we know this.

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:13.825
Is that all we are?

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.711
Are we just a bunch of traits?

00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.825
No, we're not.

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:22.372
Remember, you're like some other people

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.975
and like no other person.

00:11:25.487 --> 00:11:27.922
How about that idiosyncratic you?

00:11:28.485 --> 00:11:31.736
As Elizabeth or as George,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.640
you may share your extroversion
or your neuroticism.

00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.258
But are there some distinctively
Elizabethan features of your behavior,

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:42.479
or Georgian of yours,

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:47.582
that make us understand you
better than just a bunch of traits?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.643
That make us love you?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.455
Not just because you're
a certain type of person.

00:11:55.188 --> 00:11:57.812
I'm uncomfortable putting
people in pigeonholes.

00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.672
I don't even think pigeons
belong in pigeonholes.

00:12:03.235 --> 00:12:05.304
So what is it that makes us different?

00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:10.901
It's the doings that we have
in our life -- the personal projects.

00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:13.224
You have a personal project right now,

00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:16.334
but nobody may know it here.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.312
It relates to your kid --

00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:21.536
you've been back three times
to the hospital,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.456
and they still don't know what's wrong.

00:12:25.373 --> 00:12:26.697
Or it could be your mom.

00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:30.194
And you'd been acting out of character.

00:12:30.218 --> 00:12:31.780
These are free traits.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.601
You're very agreeable,
but you act disagreeably

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:40.498
in order to break down those barriers
of administrative torpor

00:12:40.522 --> 00:12:41.673
in the hospital,

00:12:41.697 --> 00:12:44.323
to get something
for your mom or your child.

00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:47.321
What are these free traits?

00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:49.915
They're where we enact a script

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:52.592
in order to advance
a core project in our lives.

00:12:53.744 --> 00:12:55.802
And they are what matters.

00:12:55.826 --> 00:12:58.098
Don't ask people what type you are;

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:01.496
ask them, "What are your core
projects in your life?"

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.304
And we enact those free traits.

00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:04.643
I'm an introvert,

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:09.253
but I have a core project,
which is to profess.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.848
I'm a professor.

00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:13.655
And I adore my students,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.667
and I adore my field.

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:22.469
And I can't wait to tell them
about what's new, what's exciting,

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:25.618
what I can't wait to tell them about.

00:13:25.642 --> 00:13:27.462
And so I act in an extroverted way,

00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:29.014
because at eight in the morning,

00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:31.382
the students need a little bit of humor,

00:13:31.406 --> 00:13:34.128
a little bit of engagement
to keep them going

00:13:34.152 --> 00:13:35.603
in arduous days of study.

00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:37.714
But we need to be very careful

00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:41.412
when we act protractedly out of character.

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:47.411
Sometimes we may find
that we don't take care of ourselves.

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:53.923
I find, for example, after a period
of pseudo-extroverted behavior,

00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:56.247
I need to repair somewhere on my own.

00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:01.035
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,

00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:04.031
in a chapter that featured
the strange Canadian professor

00:14:04.055 --> 00:14:06.050
who was teaching at the time at Harvard,

00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:08.805
I sometimes go to the men's room

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:12.525
to escape the slings and arrows
of outrageous extroverts.

00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:14.153
(Laughter)

00:14:14.177 --> 00:14:20.549
I remember one particular day
when I was retired to a cubicle,

00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:22.498
trying to avoid overstimulation.

00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:28.364
And a real extrovert came
in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,

00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:30.343
but in the next cubicle over --

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:32.690
and I could hear various
evacuatory noises,

00:14:32.714 --> 00:14:34.983
which we hate -- even our own,

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.737
that's why we flush
during as well as after.

00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:39.493
(Laughter)

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.950
And then I heard
this gravelly voice saying,

00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:47.409
"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:49.362
(Laughter)

00:14:50.664 --> 00:14:57.031
If anything is guaranteed
to constipate an introvert for six months,

00:14:57.055 --> 00:14:58.816
it's talking on the john.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.070
(Laughter)

00:15:00.094 --> 00:15:02.194
That's where I'm going now.

00:15:02.696 --> 00:15:04.052
Don't follow me.

00:15:04.564 --> 00:15:05.743
Thank you.

00:15:05.767 --> 00:15:14.885
(Applause)
