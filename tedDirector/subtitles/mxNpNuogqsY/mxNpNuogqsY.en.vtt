00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:16.271
I was three months pregnant with twins

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:19.639
when my husband Ross and I
went to my second sonogram.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.539
I was 35 years old at the time,

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:26.883
and I knew that that meant
we had a higher risk

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:28.851
of having a child with a birth defect.

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:32.965
So, Ross and I researched
the standard birth defects,

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.989
and we felt reasonably prepared.

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:37.918
Well, nothing would have prepared us

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:40.996
for the bizarre diagnosis
that we were about to face.

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.830
The doctor explained
that one of our twins, Thomas,

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:48.678
had a fatal birth defect
called anencephaly.

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:52.870
This means that his brain
was not formed correctly

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.870
because part of his skull was missing.

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:59.187
Babies with this diagnosis
typically die in utero

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:02.782
or within a few minutes, hours
or days of being born.

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:08.228
But the other twin, Callum,

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:12.140
appeared to be healthy,
as far as the doctor could tell,

00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:16.331
and these twins were identical,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:17.624
genetically identical.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:24.737
So after a lot of questions about
how this could have possibly happened,

00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:27.897
a selective reduction was mentioned,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.822
and while this procedure
was not impossible,

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:35.204
it posed some unique risks
for the healthy twin and for me,

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.585
so we decided to carry
the pregnancy to term.

00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:43.292
So there I was, three months pregnant,
with two trimesters ahead of me,

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:48.195
and I had to find a way to manage
my blood pressure and my stress.

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:54.204
And it felt like having a roommate
point a loaded gun at you for six months.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:02:00.483
But I stared down
the barrel of that gun for so long

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.570
that I saw a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.610
While there was nothing we could do
to prevent the tragedy,

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.097
I wanted to find a way
for Thomas's brief life

00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.342
to have some kind of positive impact.

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:15.032
So I asked my nurse about organ,
eye and tissue donation.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.601
She connected with our local
organ-procurement organization,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:21.918
the Washington Regional
Transplant Community.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.930
WRTC explained to me

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:30.355
that Thomas would probably be too small
at birth to donate for transplant,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.529
and I was shocked:

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:33.957
I didn't even know
you could be rejected for that.

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:37.393
But they said that he would be
a good candidate to donate for research.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.321
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.240
As opposed to just a victim of a disease,

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:46.851
I started to see him as a possible key
to unlock a medical mystery.

00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:51.566
On March 23, 2010,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.097
the twins were born,
and they were both born alive.

00:02:55.978 --> 00:02:57.644
And just like the doctor said,

00:02:57.668 --> 00:03:00.747
Thomas was missing
the top part of his skull,

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:02.294
but he could nurse,

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:03.770
drink from a bottle,

00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:07.093
cuddle and grab our fingers
like a normal baby,

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:08.714
and he slept in our arms.

00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:13.442
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:14.862
surrounded by our family.

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:20.981
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:23.544
and brought him to Children's
National Medical Center.

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:28.572
A few hours later, we got a call to say
that the recovery was a success,

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:31.830
and Thomas's donations
would be going to four different places.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.555
His cord blood would go
to Duke University.

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:39.223
His liver would go to a cell-therapy
company called Cytonet in Durham.

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:43.508
His corneas would go
to Schepens Eye Research Institute,

00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:45.691
which is part of Harvard Medical School,

00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:48.571
and his retinas would go
to the University of Pennsylvania.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:54.011
A few days later, we had a funeral
with our immediate family,

00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:55.979
including baby Callum,

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:59.317
and we basically
closed this chapter in our lives.

00:03:59.718 --> 00:04:02.634
But I did find myself wondering,
what's happening now?

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.722
What are the researchers learning?

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.423
And was it even worthwhile to donate?

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.741
WRTC invited Ross and I
to a grief retreat,

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:15.518
and we met about
15 other grieving families

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.169
who had donated their loved one's
organs for transplant.

00:04:19.494 --> 00:04:21.895
Some of them had even received letters

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.888
from the people who received
their loved one's organs,

00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:26.077
saying thank you.

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:29.227
I learned that they
could even meet each other

00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:30.689
if they'd both sign a waiver,

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:32.109
almost like an open adoption.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:35.746
And I was so excited,
I thought maybe I could write a letter

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.379
or I could get a letter
and learn about what happened.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.942
But I was disappointed to learn

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:43.136
that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.422
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:47.596
(Laughter)

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.000
But over the years that followed,

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.500
I learned a lot more about donation,

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:54.602
and I even got a job in the field.

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.039
And I came up with an idea.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.538
I wrote a letter that started out,

00:04:59.562 --> 00:05:00.728
"Dear Researcher."

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.318
I explained who I was,

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:08.210
and I asked if they could tell me
why they requested infant retinas

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:10.469
in March of 2010,

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:12.762
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.

00:05:13.953 --> 00:05:17.049
I emailed it to the eye bank
that arranged the donation,

00:05:17.073 --> 00:05:19.451
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:21.967
and asked if they could
send it to the right person.

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:24.626
They said that they had
never done this before,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.539
and they couldn't guarantee a response,

00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:29.379
but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
and they would deliver it.

00:05:30.506 --> 00:05:32.697
Two days later, I got a response

00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:35.705
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
of the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:38.239
She thanked me for the donation,

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:40.986
and she explained
that she is studying retinoblastoma,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.827
which is a deadly cancer of the retina

00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:44.977
that affects children
under the age of five,

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.691
and she said that yes,
we were invited to visit her lab.

00:05:48.612 --> 00:05:50.254
So next we talked on the phone,

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:52.325
and one of the first things she said to me

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.180
was that she couldn't possibly
imagine how we felt,

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:57.944
and that Thomas had given
the ultimate sacrifice,

00:05:57.968 --> 00:06:00.055
and that she seemed
to feel indebted to us.

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:03.835
So I said, "Nothing against your study,

00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:05.525
but we didn't actually pick it.

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:08.707
We donated to the system,
and the system chose your study.

00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:14.383
I said, "And second of all,
bad things happen to children every day,

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.195
and if you didn't want these retinas,

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.749
they would probably
be buried in the ground right now.

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:22.139
So to be able to participate in your study

00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:25.806
gives Thomas's life
a new layer of meaning.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.774
So, never feel guilty
about using this tissue."

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:32.379
Next, she explained to me how rare it was.

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:36.099
She had placed a request
for this tissue six years earlier

00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:38.336
with the National Disease
Research Interchange.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.494
She got only one sample of tissue
that fit her criteria,

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:43.723
and it was Thomas's.

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.688
Next, we arranged a date for me
to come visit the lab,

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:53.362
and we chose March 23, 2015,
which was the twins' fifth birthday.

00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:58.499
After we hung up, I emailed her
some pictures of Thomas and Callum,

00:06:58.523 --> 00:07:01.412
and a few weeks later,
we received this T-shirt in the mail.

00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:05.941
A few months later, Ross, Callum
and I piled in the car

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.556
and we went for a road trip.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.144
We met Arupa and her staff,

00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:14.416
and Arupa said that when I told her
not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.741
and that she hadn't seen it
from our perspective.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.328
She also explained that Thomas
had a secret code name.

00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:26.300
The same way Henrietta Lacks
is called HeLa,

00:07:26.324 --> 00:07:28.950
Thomas was called RES 360.

00:07:29.394 --> 00:07:30.792
RES means research,

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:34.316
and 360 means he was the 360th specimen

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.125
over the course of about 10 years.

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:41.276
She also shared with us a unique document,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.785
and it was the shipping label

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:47.293
that sent his retinas
from DC to Philadelphia.

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:51.662
This shipping label
is like an heirloom to us now.

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:55.812
It's the same way that a military medal
or a wedding certificate might be.

00:07:56.687 --> 00:08:02.087
Arupa also explained that she is using
Thomas's retina and his RNA

00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:05.521
to try to inactivate the gene
that causes tumor formation,

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:08.655
and she even showed us some results
that were based on RES 360.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.793
Then she took us to the freezer

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:15.252
and she showed us the two samples
that she still has

00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:17.598
that are still labeled RES 360.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.482
There's two little ones left.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.034
She said she saved it

00:08:21.058 --> 00:08:23.386
because she doesn't know
when she might get more.

00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:26.601
After this, we went to the conference room

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:29.235
and we relaxed and we had lunch together,

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.529
and the lab staff presented Callum
with a birthday gift.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.822
It was a child's lab kit.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.807
And they also offered him an internship.

00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:42.014
(Laughter)

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:45.188
So in closing, I have two
simple messages today.

00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:49.382
One is that most of us probably
don't think about donating to research.

00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:52.516
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.691
But I did it.

00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:55.857
It was a good experience,
and I recommend it,

00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:57.825
and it brought my family a lot of peace.

00:08:57.849 --> 00:09:00.634
And second is if you work
with human tissue

00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:03.253
and you wonder about the donor
and about the family,

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.472
write them a letter.

00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:07.312
Tell them you received it,
tell them what you're working on,

00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:09.003
and invite them to visit your lab,

00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:11.552
because that visit may be
even more gratifying for you

00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:12.807
than it is for them.

00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:14.593
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:17.576
If you're ever successful
in arranging one of these visits,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.918
please tell me about it.

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:21.760
The other part of my family's story

00:09:21.784 --> 00:09:24.096
is that we ended up visiting
all four facilities

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.182
that received Thomas's donations.

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:29.130
And we met amazing people
doing inspiring work.

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:35.104
The way I see it now
is that Thomas got into Harvard,

00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:37.294
Duke and Penn --

00:09:37.318 --> 00:09:40.643
(Laughter)

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:43.035
And he has a job at Cytonet,

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:45.844
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:47.629
who are in the top of their fields.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:50.224
And they need him
in order to do their job.

00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:55.788
And a life that once seemed
brief and insignificant

00:09:55.812 --> 00:10:01.494
revealed itself to be vital,
everlasting and relevant.

00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:04.771
And I only hope that my life
can be as relevant.

00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:06.663
Thank you.

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:16.415
(Applause)
