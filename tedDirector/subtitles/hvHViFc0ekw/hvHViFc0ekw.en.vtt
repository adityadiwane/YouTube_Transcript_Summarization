00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
This is the exact moment

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
that I started creating something called Tinkering School.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and hammers and other dangerous objects,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and be trusted.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Trusted not to hurt themselves,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
and trusted not to hurt others.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
and there are no tests.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
When the kids arrive

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
they're confronted with lots of stuff:

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
wood and nails and rope and wheels,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and lots of tools, real tools.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.160
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And within that context, we can offer the kids time --

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
something that seems in short supply

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
in their over-scheduled lives.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Our goal is to ensure that they leave

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
with a better sense of how to make things

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
than when they arrived,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
and the deep internal realization

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
that you can figure things out by fooling around.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
(Laughter)

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
And the kids soon learn

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
that all projects go awry --

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160
(Laughter)

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
and become at ease with the idea that every step

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
in a project is a step closer

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
to sweet success,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
or gleeful calamity.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
We start from doodles and sketches.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And sometimes we make real plans.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
And sometimes we just start building.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Building is at the heart of the experience:

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
hands on, deeply immersed

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
and fully committed to the problem at hand.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Robin and I, acting as collaborators,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
keep the landscape of the projects

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
tilted towards completion.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
Success is in the doing,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
and failures are celebrated and analyzed.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Problems become puzzles

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
and obstacles disappear.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
When faced with particularly difficult

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
setbacks or complexities,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.160
a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
(Laughter)

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
Decoration of the unfinished project

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
is a kind of conceptual incubation.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
From these interludes come deep insights

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
and amazing new approaches to solving the problems

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
that had them frustrated just moments before.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
All materials are available for use.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
can become a bridge

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
stronger than anyone imagined.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And the things that they build

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
amaze even themselves.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Video: Three, two, one, go!

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Video: Yay!

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
(Applause)

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.160
(Applause)
