00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.640
June 2010.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.640
I landed for the first time
in Rome, Italy.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.696
I wasn't there to sightsee.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.840
I was there to solve world hunger.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.256
(Laughter)

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.496
That's right.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.616
I was a 25-year-old PhD student

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.736
armed with a prototype tool
developed back at my university,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.840
and I was going to help
the World Food Programme fix hunger.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.576
So I strode into the headquarters building

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.416
and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.400
and I smiled as I thought to myself,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.456
"The engineer is here."

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.696
(Laughter)

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.496
Give me your data.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.696
I'm going to optimize everything.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.456
(Laughter)

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.376
Tell me the food that you've purchased,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.016
tell me where it's going
and when it needs to be there,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.776
and I'm going to tell you
the shortest, fastest, cheapest,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.736
best set of routes to take for the food.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.256
We're going to save money,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.376
we're going to avoid
delays and disruptions,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.136
and bottom line,
we're going to save lives.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.376
You're welcome.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.096
(Laughter)

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.096
I thought it was going to take 12 months,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.680
OK, maybe even 13.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080
This is not quite how it panned out.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.376
Just a couple of months into the project,
my French boss, he told me,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.216
"You know, Mallory,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.896
it's a good idea,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.256
but the data you need
for your algorithms is not there.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.816
It's the right idea but at the wrong time,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.136
and the right idea at the wrong time

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.536
is the wrong idea."

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.880
(Laughter)

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.240
Project over.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.320
I was crushed.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.456
When I look back now

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.136
on that first summer in Rome

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.816
and I see how much has changed
over the past six years,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080
it is an absolute transformation.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.040
It's a coming of age for bringing data
into the humanitarian world.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.816
It's exciting. It's inspiring.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.040
But we're not there yet.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.616
And brace yourself, executives,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.616
because I'm going to be putting companies

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.760
on the hot seat to step up
and play the role that I know they can.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.336
My experiences back in Rome prove

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.440
using data you can save lives.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.896
OK, not that first attempt,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.496
but eventually we got there.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.256
Let me paint the picture for you.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.016
Imagine that you have to plan
breakfast, lunch and dinner

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.656
for 500,000 people,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.816
and you only have
a certain budget to do it,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080
say 6.5 million dollars per month.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.682
Well, what should you do?
What's the best way to handle it?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.040
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.976
How much?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.136
It sounds simple. It's not.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.376
You have 30 possible foods,
and you have to pick five of them.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.816
That's already over 140,000
different combinations.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.536
Then for each food that you pick,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.536
you need to decide how much you'll buy,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.256
where you're going to get it from,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.760
where you're going to store it,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.736
how long it's going to take to get there.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.096
You need to look at all of the different
transportation routes as well.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.200
And that's already
over 900 million options.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.496
If you considered each option
for a single second,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.856
that would take you
over 28 years to get through.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.400
900 million options.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.616
So we created a tool
that allowed decisionmakers

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.256
to weed through all 900 million options

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.640
in just a matter of days.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.800
It turned out to be incredibly successful.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.656
In an operation in Iraq,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.216
we saved 17 percent of the costs,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.376
and this meant that you had the ability
to feed an additional 80,000 people.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.800
It's all thanks to the use of data
and modeling complex systems.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.080
But we didn't do it alone.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.576
The unit that I worked with in Rome,
they were unique.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.336
They believed in collaboration.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.056
They brought in the academic world.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.360
They brought in companies.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.816
And if we really want to make big changes
in big problems like world hunger,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.400
we need everybody to the table.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.976
We need the data people
from humanitarian organizations

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.256
leading the way,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.856
and orchestrating
just the right types of engagements

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.576
with academics, with governments.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.296
And there's one group that's not being
leveraged in the way that it should be.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.416
Did you guess it? Companies.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040
Companies have a major role to play
in fixing the big problems in our world.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.296
I've been in the private sector
for two years now.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.896
I've seen what companies can do,
and I've seen what companies aren't doing,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.296
and I think there's three main ways
that we can fill that gap:

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.416
by donating data,
by donating decision scientists

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.920
and by donating technology
to gather new sources of data.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.496
This is data philanthropy,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.360
and it's the future of corporate
social responsibility.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.760
Bonus, it also makes good business sense.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.136
Companies today,
they collect mountains of data,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.922
so the first thing they can do
is start donating that data.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.136
Some companies are already doing it.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.576
Take, for example,
a major telecom company.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.376
They opened up their data
in Senegal and the Ivory Coast

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.376
and researchers discovered

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.734
that if you look at the patterns
in the pings to the cell phone towers,

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:07.696
you can see where people are traveling.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.896
And that can tell you things like

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.016
where malaria might spread,
and you can make predictions with it.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.936
Or take for example
an innovative satellite company.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.976
They opened up their data and donated it,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.656
and with that data you could track

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.720
how droughts are impacting
food production.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.600
With that you can actually trigger
aid funding before a crisis can happen.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.840
This is a great start.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.720
There's important insights
just locked away in company data.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.296
And yes, you need to be very careful.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.896
You need to respect privacy concerns,
for example by anonymizing the data.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.696
But even if the floodgates opened up,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.256
and even if all companies
donated their data

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.536
to academics, to NGOs,
to humanitarian organizations,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.536
it wouldn't be enough
to harness that full impact of data

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.080
for humanitarian goals.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.776
Why?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.040
To unlock insights in data,
you need decision scientists.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.336
Decision scientists are people like me.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.176
They take the data, they clean it up,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.456
transform it and put it
into a useful algorithm

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.320
that's the best choice
to address the business need at hand.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.496
In the world of humanitarian aid,
there are very few decision scientists.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.160
Most of them work for companies.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.976
So that's the second thing
that companies need to do.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.696
In addition to donating their data,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.880
they need to donate
their decision scientists.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.256
Now, companies will say, "Ah! Don't take
our decision scientists from us.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.320
We need every spare second of their time."

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.560
But there's a way.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.616
If a company was going to donate
a block of a decision scientist's time,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.776
it would actually make more sense
to spread out that block of time

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000
over a long period,
say for example five years.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.656
This might only amount
to a couple of hours per month,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.736
which a company would hardly miss,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.240
but what it enables is really important:
long-term partnerships.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.736
Long-term partnerships
allow you to build relationships,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.416
to get to know the data,
to really understand it

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.856
and to start to understand
the needs and challenges

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.040
that the humanitarian
organization is facing.

00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:09.536
In Rome, at the World Food Programme,
this took us five years to do,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.016
five years.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.376
That first three years, OK,
that was just what we couldn't solve for.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.896
Then there was two years after that
of refining and implementing the tool,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.720
like in the operations in Iraq
and other countries.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.616
I don't think that's
an unrealistic timeline

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.376
when it comes to using data
to make operational changes.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.800
It's an investment. It requires patience.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.256
But the types of results
that can be produced are undeniable.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.840
In our case, it was the ability
to feed tens of thousands more people.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.776
So we have donating data,
we have donating decision scientists,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.496
and there's actually a third way
that companies can help:

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.496
donating technology
to capture new sources of data.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.360
You see, there's a lot of things
we just don't have data on.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.680
Right now, Syrian refugees
are flooding into Greece,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680
and the UN refugee agency,
they have their hands full.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.056
The current system for tracking people
is paper and pencil,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.336
and what that means is

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.216
that when a mother and her five children
walk into the camp,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.896
headquarters is essentially
blind to this moment.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.256
That's all going to change
in the next few weeks,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.160
thanks to private sector collaboration.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.496
There's going to be a new system based
on donated package tracking technology

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.560
from the logistics company
that I work for.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.456
With this new system,
there will be a data trail,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.936
so you know exactly the moment

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.456
when that mother and her children
walk into the camp.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.096
And even more, you know
if she's going to have supplies

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.376
this month and the next.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.416
Information visibility drives efficiency.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.696
For companies, using technology
to gather important data,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.176
it's like bread and butter.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.776
They've been doing it for years,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.056
and it's led to major
operational efficiency improvements.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.440
Just try to imagine
your favorite beverage company

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.856
trying to plan their inventory

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.376
and not knowing how many bottles
were on the shelves.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.616
It's absurd.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.200
Data drives better decisions.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.336
Now, if you're representing a company,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.496
and you're pragmatic
and not just idealistic,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.576
you might be saying to yourself,
"OK, this is all great, Mallory,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.440
but why should I want to be involved?"

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.816
Well for one thing, beyond the good PR,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.616
humanitarian aid
is a 24-billion-dollar sector,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.696
and there's over five billion people,
maybe your next customers,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.536
that live in the developing world.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.656
Further, companies that are engaging
in data philanthropy,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.656
they're finding new insights
locked away in their data.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.936
Take, for example, a credit card company

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.296
that's opened up a center

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.696
that functions as a hub for academics,
for NGOs and governments,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.960
all working together.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.776
They're looking at information
in credit card swipes

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.776
and using that to find insights
about how households in India

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.520
live, work, earn and spend.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.256
For the humanitarian world,
this provides information

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.936
about how you might
bring people out of poverty.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.976
But for companies, it's providing
insights about your customers

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.040
and potential customers in India.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.560
It's a win all around.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.736
Now, for me, what I find
exciting about data philanthropy --

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.096
donating data, donating decision
scientists and donating technology --

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.496
it's what it means
for young professionals like me

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.360
who are choosing to work at companies.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.456
Studies show that
the next generation of the workforce

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.040
care about having their work
make a bigger impact.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.376
We want to make a difference,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.816
and so through data philanthropy,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.776
companies can actually help engage
and retain their decision scientists.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.680
And that's a big deal for a profession
that's in high demand.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.960
Data philanthropy
makes good business sense,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.480
and it also can help
revolutionize the humanitarian world.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.696
If we coordinated
the planning and logistics

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.096
across all of the major facets
of a humanitarian operation,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.720
we could feed, clothe and shelter
hundreds of thousands more people,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.696
and companies need to step up
and play the role that I know they can

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.600
in bringing about this revolution.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.656
You've probably heard of the saying
"food for thought."

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.920
Well, this is literally thought for food.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.696
It finally is the right idea
at the right time.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.936
(Laughter)

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.536
Très magnifique.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.776
Thank you.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.651
(Applause)
