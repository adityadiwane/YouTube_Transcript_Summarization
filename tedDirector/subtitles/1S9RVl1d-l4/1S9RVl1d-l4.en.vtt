00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.735
"We're declaring war against cancer,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.360
and we will win this war by 2015."

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.176
This is what the US Congress
and the National Cancer Institute declared

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.760
just a few years ago, in 2003.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.656
Now, I don't know about you,
but I don't buy that.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.736
I don't think we quite won this war yet,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.400
and I don't think
anyone here will question that.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.296
Now, I will argue that a primary reason

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.456
why we're not winning
this war against cancer

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.776
is because we're fighting blindly.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.375
I'm going to start by sharing with you
a story about a good friend of mine.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.616
His name is Ehud,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.776
and a few years ago,
Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.656
And not just any type of brain cancer:

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.856
he was diagnosed with one
of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.096
In fact, it was so deadly

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.776
that the doctors told him
that they only have 12 months,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.216
and during those 12 months,
they have to find a treatment.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.696
They have to find a cure,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.880
and if they cannot
find a cure, he will die.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.256
Now, the good news, they said,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.216
is that there are tons
of different treatments to choose from,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.456
but the bad news is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.016
that in order for them to tell
if a treatment is even working or not,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.536
well, that takes them
about three months or so.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.936
So they cannot try that many things.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.056
Well, Ehud is now going
into his first treatment,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.336
and during that first treatment,
just a few days into that treatment,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.696
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,
"Adam, I think this is working.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.536
I think we really lucked out here.
Something is happening."

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.016
And I ask him, "Really?
How do you know that, Ehud?"

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.256
And he says, "Well,
I feel so terrible inside.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.136
Something's gotta be working up there.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.376
It just has to."

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.840
Well, unfortunately, three months later,
we got the news, it didn't work.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.576
And so Ehud goes
into his second treatment.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.856
And again, the same story.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.616
"It feels so bad, something's
gotta be working there."

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.576
And then three months later,
again we get bad news.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.536
Ehud is going into his third treatment,
and then his fourth treatment.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.080
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.376
Now, when someone really close to you
is going through such a huge struggle,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.216
you get really swamped with emotions.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.336
A lot of things
are going through your head.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.816
For me, it was mostly outrage.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.536
I was just outraged that, how come
this is the best that we can offer?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.856
And I started looking
more and more into this.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.336
As it turns out, this is not just
the best that doctors could offer Ehud.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.176
It's not just the best doctors could offer
patients with brain cancer generally.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.400
We're actually not doing that well
all across the board with cancer.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.096
I picked up one of those statistics,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.896
and I'm sure some of you
have seen those statistics before.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.376
This is going to show you here
how many patients actually died of cancer,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.416
in this case females in the United States,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.736
ever since the 1930s.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.936
You'll notice that there aren't
that many things that have changed.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.256
It's still a huge issue.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.016
You'll see a few changes, though.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.576
You'll see lung cancer,
for example, on the rise.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.800
Thank you, cigarettes.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.856
And you'll also see that,
for example, stomach cancer

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.216
once used to be one
of the biggest killers of all cancers,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.680
is essentially eliminated.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.536
Now, why is that?
Anyone knows, by the way?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.896
Why is it that humanity is no longer
struck by stomach cancer?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.776
What was the huge, huge
medical technology breakthrough

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.160
that came to our world
that saved humanity from stomach cancer?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.056
Was it maybe a new drug,
or a better diagnostic?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.376
You guys are right, yeah.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.016
It's the invention of the refrigerator,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.656
and the fact that we're
no longer eating spoiled meats.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.976
So the best thing
that happened to us so far

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.936
in the medical arena in cancer research

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.151
is the fact that
the refrigerator was invented.

00:03:32.175 --> 00:03:33.376
(Laughter)

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.656
And so -- yeah, I know.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.096
We're not doing so well here.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.456
I don't want to miniaturize the progress

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.856
and everything that's been done
in cancer research.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.296
Look, there is like 50-plus years
of good cancer research

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.736
that discovered major, major things
that taught us about cancer.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.496
But all that said,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.092
we have a lot of heavy lifting
to still do ahead of us.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.016
Again, I will argue that the primary
reason why this is the case,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.040
why we have not done that remarkably well,

00:04:00.064 --> 00:04:01.896
is really we're fighting blindly here.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.136
And this is where
medical imaging comes in.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.840
This is where my own work comes in.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.136
And so to give you a sense
of the best medical imaging

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.656
that's offered today
to brain cancer patients,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.856
or actually generally
to all cancer patients,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.816
take a look at this PET scan right here.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.080
Let's see. There we go.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.336
So this is a PET/CT scan,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.816
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.056
is the CT scan will show you
where the bones are,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.480
and the PET scan will show you
where tumors are.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.176
Now, what you can see here

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.616
is essentially a sugar molecule

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.456
that was added a small little tag

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.576
that is signaling to us
outside of the body,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.896
"Hey, I'm here."

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.736
And those sugar molecules are injected
into these patients by the billions,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.456
and they're going all over the body

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.560
looking for cells
that are hungry for sugar.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.976
You'll see that the heart,
for example, lights up there.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.216
That's because the heart
needs a lot of sugar.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.576
You'll also see that the bladder
lights up there.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.216
That's because the bladder
is the thing that's clearing

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.640
the sugar away from our body.

00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:00.096
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.736
and these are in fact the tumors.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.896
Now, this is a really
a wonderful technology.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.056
For the first time it allowed us
to look into someone's body

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.456
without picking up
each and every one of the cells

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.336
and putting them under the microscope,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.376
but in a noninvasive way
allowing us to look into someone's body

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.536
and ask, "Hey,
has the cancer metastasized?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.776
Where is it?"

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.296
And the PET scans here
are showing you very clearly

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.600
where are these hot spots,
where is the tumor.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.776
So as miraculous as this might seem,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.680
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.400
You see, those
small little hot spots there.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.760
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells
are in any one of these tumors?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.936
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.656
and let me make sure
that this number sunk in.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.016
In each and every one
of these small little blips

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.616
that you're seeing on the image,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.736
there needs to be
at least 100 million cancer cells

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.296
in order for it to be detected.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.776
Now, if that seemed to you
like a very large number,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.480
it is a very large number.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.696
This is in fact
an incredibly large number,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.056
because what we really need
in order to pick up something early enough

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.016
to do something about it,
to do something meaningful about it,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.176
well, we need to pick up tumors
that are a thousand cells in size,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.336
and ideally just
a handful of cells in size.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.376
So we're clearly
pretty far away from this.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.656
So we're going to play
a little experiment here.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.136
I'm going to ask each of you
to now play and imagine

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.520
that you are brain surgeons.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.016
And you guys are now at an operating room,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.056
and there's a patient in front of you,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.800
and your task is to make sure
that the tumor is out.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.776
So you're looking down at the patient,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.136
the skin and the skull
have already been removed,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.696
so you're looking at the brain.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.416
And all you know about this patient

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.256
is that there's a tumor
about the size of a golf ball or so

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.600
in the right frontal lobe
of this person's brain.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.416
And that's more or less it.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.656
So you're looking down, and unfortunately
everything looks the same,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.776
because brain cancer tissue
and healthy brain tissue

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.376
really just look the same.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.296
And so you're going in with your thumb,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.656
and you start to press
a little bit on the brain,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.096
because tumors tend to be
a little harder, stiffer,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.736
and so you go in and go
a little bit like this and say,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.736
"It seems like the tumor is right there."

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.416
Then you take out your knife
and start cutting the tumor

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.696
piece by piece by piece.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.416
And as you're taking the tumor out,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.656
then you're getting
to a stage where you think,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.816
"Alright, I'm done.
I took out everything."

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.376
And at this stage, if that's --

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.096
so far everything sounded,
like, pretty crazy --

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.816
you're now about to face the most
challenging decision of your life here.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.376
Because now you need to decide,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.096
should I stop here
and let this patient go,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.056
risking that there might be
some leftover cancer cells behind

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.936
that I just couldn't see,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.616
or should I take away some extra margins,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.496
typically about an inch or so
around the tumor

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.720
just to be sure that I removed everything?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.240
So this is not a simple decision to make,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.776
and unfortunately this is the decision

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.136
that brain cancer surgeons
have to take every single day

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.760
as they're seeing their patients.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.256
And so I remember talking
to a few friends of mine in the lab,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.656
and we say, "Boy,
there's got to be a better way."

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.096
But not just like you tell a friend
that there's got to be a better way.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.073
There's just got to be a better way here.

00:08:06.097 --> 00:08:07.616
This is just incredible.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.296
And so we looked back.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.296
Remember those PET scans I told you about,
the sugar and so on.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.056
We said, hey, how about
instead of using sugar molecules,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.216
let's maybe take tiny, tiny
little particles made of gold,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.896
and let's program them with some
interesting chemistry around them.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.336
Let's program them
to look for cancer cells.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.456
And then we will inject
these gold particles

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.736
into these patients by the billions again,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.736
and we'll have them go all over the body,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.736
and just like secret agents, if you will,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.576
go and walk by
every single cell in our body

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.296
and knock on the door of that cell,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.056
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell
or are you a healthy cell?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.096
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.856
If you're a cancer cell,
we're sticking in and shining out

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.976
and telling us,
"Hey, look at me, I'm here."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.376
And they'll do it
through some interesting cameras

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.816
that we developed in the lab.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.775
And once we see that,
maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:57.200
towards taking only the tumor
and leaving the healthy brain alone.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.776
And so we've tested that,
and boy, this works well.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.776
So I'm going to show you an example now.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.576
What you're looking at here

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.536
is an image of a mouse's brain,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.696
and we've implanted
into this mouse's brain

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.976
a small little tumor.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.616
And so this tumor is now
growing in this mouse's brain,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.296
and then we've taken a doctor
and asked the doctor

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.136
to please operate on the mouse
as if that was a patient,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.576
and take out piece by piece
out of the tumor.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.376
And while he's doing that,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.376
we're going to take images
to see where the gold particles are.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.016
And so we're going to first start

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.456
by injecting these gold particles
into this mouse,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.376
and we're going to see
right here at the very left there

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.656
that image at the bottom

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.176
is the image that shows
where the gold particles are.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.256
The nice thing
is that these gold particles

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.296
actually made it all the way to the tumor,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.976
and then they shine out and tell us,
"Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.376
So now we can see the tumor,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.536
but we're not showing this
to the doctor yet.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.616
We're asking the doctor,
now please start cutting away the tumor,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.056
and you'll see here the doctor
just took the first quadrant of the tumor

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.296
and you see that first quadrant
is now missing.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.776
The doctor then took
the second quadrant, the third,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.536
and now it appears to be everything.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.296
And so at this stage,
the doctor came back to us and said,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.576
"Alright, I'm done.
What do you want me to do?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.176
Should I keep things as they are

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.696
or do you want me to take
some extra margins around?"

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.376
And then we said, "Well, hang on."

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.816
We told the doctor,
"You've missed those two spots,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.840
so rather than taking huge margins around,

00:10:18.864 --> 00:10:20.696
only take out those tiny little areas.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.736
Take them out,
and then let's take a look."

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.616
And so the doctor took them away,
and lo and behold,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.656
the cancer is now completely gone.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.056
Now, the important thing

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.700
is that it's not just
that the cancer is completely gone

00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:33.056
from this person's brain,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.400
or from this mouse's brain.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.416
The most important thing

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.336
is that we did not have to take
huge amounts of healthy brain

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.576
in the process.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.776
And so now we can actually imagine a world

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.696
where doctors and surgeons,
as they take away a tumor,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.140
they actually know what to take out,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.280
and they no longer
have to guess with their thumb.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.456
Now, here's why it's extremely important
to take those tiny little leftover tumors.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.336
Those leftover tumors,
even if it's just a handful of cells,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.416
they will grow to recur the tumor,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.096
for the tumor to come back.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.056
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.296
of those brain cancer surgeries
ultimately fail

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.096
is because of those small little
extra margins that were left positive,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.800
those small little leftover tumors
that were left there.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.616
So this is clearly very nice,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.936
but what I really want to share with you
is where I think we're heading from here.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.616
And so in my lab at Stanford,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.160
my students and I are asking,
what should we be working on now?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.456
And I think where
medical imaging is heading to

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.816
is the ability to look into the human body

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.280
and actually see each and every one
of these cells separately.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.736
The ability like this would allow us

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.656
to actually pick up tumors
way, way earlier in the process,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.600
way before it's 100 million cells inside,
so we can actually do something about it.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.616
An ability to see each and every one
of the cells might also allow us

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.016
to ask insightful questions.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.136
So in the lab,
we are now getting to a point

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.416
where we can actually start asking
these cancer cells real questions,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.216
like, for example, are you responding
to the treatment we are giving you or not?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.696
So if you're not responding, we'll know
to stop the treatment right away,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.760
days into the treatment, not three months.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.656
And so also for patients like Ehud

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.096
that are going through these
nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.376
for them not to suffer

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.296
through those horrendous
side effects of the drugs

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.976
when the drugs are
in fact not even helping them.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.936
So to be frank here,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.416
we're pretty far away
from winning the war against cancer,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.696
just to be realistic.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.616
But at least I am hopeful

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.776
that we should be able to fight this war
with better medical imaging techniques

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.656
in the way that is not blind.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.896
Thank you.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.160
(Applause)
