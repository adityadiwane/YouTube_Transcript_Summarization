00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.832
I have a confession.

00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:19.305
I have been in an affair

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.532
since I was 17 years old.

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:26.551
I wish I could talk about
butterflies in my stomach

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:29.414
or maps I drew on the ground

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:31.723
when I think about this affair,

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:33.166
but I cannot.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:37.156
I wish I could talk about
sweet words spoken

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.253
or gifts that I received

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.997
from this affair,

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.497
but I cannot.

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:46.917
All I can tell you about is the aftermath,

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:51.494
about days I spent constantly asking:

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.891
Why, why, why me?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.385
I remember how it all began.

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:02.875
I was in my final year of high school,

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.022
and my class had just won in sports,

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:10.765
so we were singing and dancing
and hugging each other.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.573
I went and took a shower.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:14.181
Then I went for dinner.

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.311
And when I sat down to eat,

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:19.885
my teeth started chattering,

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.444
and so I couldn't put
the spoon in my mouth.

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:25.022
I rushed to the nurse's office,

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:28.222
and because I couldn't talk,
I just pointed at my mouth.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:30.770
She didn't know what was happening,

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:32.878
so she told me to lie down,

00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:34.174
and it worked --

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:36.661
after a few minutes,
the chattering stopped.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:41.113
I was about to dash out,
and she told me --

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:45.267
no, she insisted -- that I go up
to the dormitories to sleep.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.202
Here I was in my final year
of high school,

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:53.781
just a few months from doing
my end of high school exams

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:58.694
and a few days from doing a set
of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks,"

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:04.399
which are somehow meant to gauge
how prepared one is for the final exams.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.715
There is no way I was going to sleep

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.183
and let a set of exams mock me.

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:12.210
I went to class, sat down,

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.589
took my Kenyan history notes,

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:18.378
and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.885
with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.907
the Giriama woman who led her people
against British colonial rule.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.235
Then, without any notice,

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.036
my left hand started jerking,

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:37.111
and it was as if I was marking
imaginary papers.

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:40.299
In and out it went,

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:44.148
and with every stroke, one by one,

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:47.655
my classmates stopped
concentrating on their reading

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.713
and started looking at me.

00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:53.047
And I tried really hard to stop it,

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:54.727
but I couldn't,

00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.801
because it had a life of its own.

00:02:58.107 --> 00:03:02.729
And then, when it was sure
everybody was looking at us,

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:06.943
in its final show
and official introduction,

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.776
I had my first full-blown seizure,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.953
which was the beginning of what
has been a 15-year-long affair.

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:23.916
Seizures are the trademark characteristic
for most types of epilepsy,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.418
and every first-ever seizure
needs to be assessed by a doctor

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:30.945
to determine if one has epilepsy

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.655
or if it's a symptom of something else.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.535
In my case, it was confirmed
that I had epilepsy.

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:42.986
I spent a large chunk of my time
in hospital and at home,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.295
and only went back to do my final exams.

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:51.104
I had seizures in between papers,

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.264
but managed to get good enough grades

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:56.548
to be admitted for an actuarial
science degree

00:03:56.572 --> 00:03:58.163
at the University of Nairobi.

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:01.635
(Applause)

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.093
Unfortunately, I had to drop out
in my second year.

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:11.560
I didn't have good enough coping skills

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.720
and a support community around me.

00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:16.225
I was lucky enough to get a job,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.734
but I was fired from that job
when I had a seizure in the workplace.

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:26.645
So I found myself in a space

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.101
where I was constantly asking myself

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.596
why this had to happen to me.

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:36.406
I lived in denial for a long time,

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:44.125
and the denial was maybe because
of the things that had happened,

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.869
dropping out of school
and being fired from my job.

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:51.538
Or maybe it was because of the things
I had heard about epilepsy

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:54.147
and about people living with epilepsy:

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:56.403
that they would never live on their own;

00:04:56.427 --> 00:04:58.668
that they would never travel on their own

00:04:58.692 --> 00:05:00.112
or even get work;

00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:03.040
that they were outcasts,

00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:06.887
with a spirit in them that they needed
to be delivered from.

00:05:08.482 --> 00:05:12.109
And so the more I thought
about these things,

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:15.810
the more my seizures became,

00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:18.939
and I spent days with my legs locked,

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:22.384
my speech became blurred

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:26.069
and on days on end, this is how I'd be.

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.900
Two or three days after a seizure,

00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:32.154
my head and my hand
would still be twitching.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.683
I felt lost,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.444
like I'd lost everything,

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:40.810
and sometimes,

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:44.315
even the will to live.

00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:54.886
(Sigh)

00:06:00.377 --> 00:06:02.912
I had so much frustration in me.

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.368
And so I started writing,

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:08.231
because the people around me
didn't have answers

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:10.210
to the questions that I had.

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:13.631
And so I wrote my fears

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:14.955
and my doubts.

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.016
I wrote about my good days
and my bad days and my really ugly days,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.790
and I shared them on a blog.

00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:24.236
And before long,

00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:28.939
I began to be seen and heard
by people who had epilepsy

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:30.397
and their families,

00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:33.257
and even those who did not
have the diagnosis.

00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:37.863
And I moved from that girl
who constantly asked why me

00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:40.674
to one who not only self-advocates,

00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:44.190
but does it for those who are yet
to find their voices.

00:06:47.197 --> 00:06:52.047
(Applause)

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:58.845
My seizures are greatly reduced,
from two to three times a day,

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:02.276
to sometimes two to three
times in one year.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.510
I went on --

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:07.498
(Applause)

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.903
I went on to employ five people,

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:14.188
when I began what was Kenya's first

00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:17.290
free mental health
and epilepsy support line.

00:07:17.682 --> 00:07:19.004
And I travel --

00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:21.325
(Applause)

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.847
And I travel to speak about my affair,

00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:28.228
all these things that I had been told

00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:32.609
people like me living with epilepsy
could never be able to do.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.326
Every year, a population
as big as 80 percent of Nairobi

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.115
gets diagnosed with epilepsy

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:42.578
across the globe.

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:44.325
And they, like me,

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.279
go through the emotions
of stigma and exclusion.

00:07:50.422 --> 00:07:53.898
And so I have made it my life journey

00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:56.506
to keep these conversations going,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.705
and I keep confessing about my affair

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.083
so that those people who do not
have the diagnosis

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:07.044
might know and might have
a constant reminder

00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:10.248
that it is alright to engage
with people like us,

00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:15.832
that as long as they pull down
the walls of stigma and exclusion,

00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:18.073
that we, just like them,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:21.777
can be able to take anything
life throws at us.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:22.984
Thank you.

00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:27.411
(Applause)
