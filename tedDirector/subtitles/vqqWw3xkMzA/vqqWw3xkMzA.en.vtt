00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Thank you.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm going to talk about a new, old material

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that still continues to amaze us,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and that might impact the way we think

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
about material science, high technology --

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and maybe, along the way,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
So that's kind of a bold statement.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I'll tell you a little bit more.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that is processed all in water and at room temperature --

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and is biodegradable with a clock,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
or have it stable for years.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
without causing any immune response.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And it's technological,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
so it can do things like microelectronics,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and maybe photonics do.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And the material

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
looks something like this.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
The components of this material are just water and protein.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So this material is silk.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So it's kind of different

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
from what we're used to thinking about silk.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So the question is, how do you reinvent something

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that has been around for five millennia?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And so we marvel at silk worms --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
The silk worm does a remarkable thing:

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
it uses these two ingredients, protein and water,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that are in its gland,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
so comparable to technical fibers

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
like Kevlar.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And so in the reverse engineering process

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that we know about,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and that we're familiar with,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
for the textile industry,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and then weaves glamorous things.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
We want to know how you go from water and protein

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So the insight

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
is how do you actually reverse engineer this

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and go from cocoon to gland

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and get water and protein that is your starting material.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And this is an insight

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that came, about two decades ago,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
David Kaplan.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And so we get this starting material.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And then we use this to do a variety of things --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
like, for example, this film.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
The recipe to make those films

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is to take advantage of the fact

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
They find their way to self-assemble.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And then you detach the protein and you get this film,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And so what does that mean?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
It means that you can interface it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
with some of the things that are typical of technology,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And the image of the DVD here

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is just to illustrate a point

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
So it would be able to replicate the information

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that is on the DVD.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
which is right here, and the message is over there.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And this requires a stable hand,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
So let me see.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So as you see the film go in transparently through there,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and then ...

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.260
(Applause)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And the most remarkable feat

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So once you have these attributes

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
of this material,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
then you can do a lot of things.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
It's actually not limited to films.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
or you do microprism arrays,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Or you can do beautiful things

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that, if the camera can capture, you can make.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And if the angle is right,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But you can do other things.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and so we've made optical fibers.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And you can think of different formats.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
we do microneedle arrays.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
What you see there on the screen is a human hair

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
superimposed on the needle that's made of silk --

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
just to give you a sense of size.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
You can do bigger things.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
You can do gears and nuts and bolts --

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that you can buy at Whole Foods.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And the gears work in water as well.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
to replace peripheral veins, for example,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
or maybe an entire bone.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And so you have here a little example

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
of a small skull --

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
what we call mini Yorick.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
(Laughter)

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
But you can do things like cups, for example,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
You can do electronic pieces

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
that fold and wrap.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So there's versatility, as you see,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
in the material formats,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
that you can do with silk.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
But there are still some unique traits.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning;

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
in principle, can be implanted and disappear.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And what you see there in that tissue section,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
in fact, is you see that reflector tape.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So, much like you're seen at night by a car,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
you can see deeper parts of tissue

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And reintegration in the human body

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is not the only thing,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
but reintegration in the environment is important.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So you have a clock, you have protein,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and now a silk cup like this

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
can be thrown away without guilt --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:56.260
(Applause)

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
unlike the polystyrene cups

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's edible,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
so you can do smart packaging around food

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that you can cook with the food.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
It doesn't taste good,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
so I'm going to need some help with that.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Silk, during its self-assembly process,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
acts like a cocoon for biological matter.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And so if you change the recipe,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and you add things when you pour --

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
so you add things to your liquid silk solution --

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
where these things are enzymes

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
or antibodies or vaccines,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
the self-assembly process

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
preserves the biological function of these dopants.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
So it makes the materials environmentally active

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and interactive.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
So that screw that you thought about beforehand

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
can actually be used

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and deliver drugs at the same,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
while your bone is healing, for example.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So we've made a silk card

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
with penicillin in it.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
so 140 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And so that could be ---

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
(Applause)

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
that could be potentially a good alternative

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And so there is this other unique material trait

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And so what you see there is the difference.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And what you see is that the film on the bottom

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
releases what is inside it.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and for reintegration in the environment

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
in all of these formats that you've seen.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
whether you want to replace a vein or a bone,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
perhaps drink a coffee in a cup

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and throw it away without guilt,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
maybe carry your drugs in your pocket,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
deliver them inside your body

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
or deliver them across the desert,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the answer may be in a thread of silk.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Thank you.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:34.260
(Applause)
