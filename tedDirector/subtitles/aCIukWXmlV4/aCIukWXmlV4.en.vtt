00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.293
Sarge Salman: All the way from
Los Altos Hills, California,

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:17.354
Mr. Henry Evans.

00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:21.246
(Applause)

00:00:32.477 --> 00:00:34.105
Henry Evans: Hello.

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:35.960
My name is Henry Evans,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.551
and until August 29, 2002,

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:44.575
I was living my version of the American dream.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:49.073
I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:50.928
My dad was a lawyer.

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:53.917
My mom was a homemaker.

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:56.368
My six siblings and I were good kids,

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.860
but caused our fair share of trouble.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.250
After high school, I left home to study

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.153
and learn more about the world.

00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:07.810
I went to Notre Dame University

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.356
and graduated with degrees
in accounting and German,

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:14.300
including spending a year of study in Austria.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.181
Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:23.193
I married my high school sweetheart, Jane.

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:25.555
I am lucky to have her.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:30.200
Together, we raised four wonderful children.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.281
I worked and studied hard
to move up the career ladder,

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.676
eventually becoming a chief financial officer

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:40.476
in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.253
My family and I bought our first and only home

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:47.089
on December 13, 2001,

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:49.298
a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:51.738
of Los Altos Hills, California,

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:54.974
from where I am speaking to you now.

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:57.584
We were looking forward to rebuilding it,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.819
but eight months after we moved in,

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.211
I suffered a stroke-like attack
caused by a birth defect.

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:09.150
Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.493
at the ripe old age of 40.

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:14.646
It took me several years,

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:18.215
but with the help of an incredibly supportive family,

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:23.074
I finally decided life was still worth living.

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.619
I became fascinated with using technology

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:30.043
to help the severely disabled.

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:32.565
Head tracking devices sold commercially

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:35.316
by the company Madentec

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:39.174
convert my tiny head movements
into cursor movements,

00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:43.460
and enable my use of a regular computer.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.719
I can surf the web, exchange email with people,

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.647
and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins

00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:51.764
in online word games.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.650
This technology allows me to remain engaged,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.003
mentally active,

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.754
and feel like I am a part of the world.

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:03.059
One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.645
when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:08.396
of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.240
demonstrating a PR2 robot.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.287
I emailed Charlie and
Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:20.139
and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.040
For about two years, Robots for Humanity

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.421
developed ways for me to use the PR2

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.801
as my body surrogate.

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:33.894
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:35.668
From my home in California,

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:39.647
I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)

00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:44.064
I handed out Halloween candy.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:50.091
I opened my refrigerator on my own.

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:54.163
I began doing tasks around the house.

00:03:54.163 --> 00:03:57.731
I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.396
to live and contribute,

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:05.022
both for myself and others in my circumstance.

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:09.630
All of us have disabilities in one form or another.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.056
For example, if either of us
wants to go 60 miles an hour,

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:20.400
both of us will need an assistive device called a car.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.716
Your disability doesn't make you
any less of a person,

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:26.140
and neither does mine.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.913
By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)

00:04:30.913 --> 00:04:33.810
Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.754
to fly on our own.

00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:40.864
Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.436
connected with me Chad Jenkins.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:45.909
Chad showed me how easy it is

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.565
to purchase and fly aerial drones.

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.153
It was then I realized that I could also use

00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:54.381
an aerial drone to expand the worlds

00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:57.519
of bedridden people through flight,

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.442
giving a sense of movement and control

00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:03.519
that is incredible.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.396
Using a mouse cursor I control with my head,

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.285
these web interfaces allow me

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:09.895
to see video from the robot

00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:11.528
and send control commands

00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:15.255
by pressing buttons in a web browser.

00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:19.164
With a little practice, I became
good enough with this interface

00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:22.841
to drive around my home on my own.

00:05:25.884 --> 00:05:28.592
I could look around our garden

00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:32.702
and see the grapes we are growing.

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:38.722
I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)

00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:41.721
One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:45.142
on our basketball hoop.

00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:49.688
I went even further by seeing if I could use

00:05:49.688 --> 00:05:52.711
a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.759
as modified by Fighting Walrus,

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.406
to have an immersive experience

00:05:56.406 --> 00:06:00.361
controlling the drone.

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:02.288
With Chad's group at Brown,

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.761
I regularly fly drones around his lab

00:06:04.768 --> 00:06:10.517
several times a week,
from my home 3,000 miles away.

00:06:10.517 --> 00:06:14.042
All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:17.072
so we also find time to play friendly games

00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:20.789
of robot soccer. (Laughter)

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.179
I never thought I would be able to casually

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:28.151
move around a campus like Brown on my own.

00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:32.493
I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:38.953
Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,

00:06:38.953 --> 00:06:41.142
I bet all of these people here

00:06:41.142 --> 00:06:43.348
would love to see you fly this drone

00:06:43.348 --> 00:06:46.513
from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:51.370
(Applause)

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.330
Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.838
(Laughter)

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:08.347
Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?

00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:12.684
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.831
Can you show us how excited you are?

00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:22.747
(Laughter)

00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:24.764
All right, big finish.

00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:28.436
Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?

00:07:29.818 --> 00:07:34.445
(Applause)

00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:36.954
All right, we still have a little ways to go with that,

00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:39.466
but I think it shows the promise.

00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:42.102
What makes Henry's story amazing

00:07:42.102 --> 00:07:45.230
is it's about understanding Henry's needs,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.224
understanding what people in Henry's situation

00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:50.133
need from technology,

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:51.790
and then also understanding

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.168
what advanced technology can provide,

00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:56.241
and then bringing those two things together

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.483
for use in a wise and responsible way.

00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:01.593
What we're trying to do is democratize robotics,

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.494
so that anybody can be a part of this.

00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:06.490
We're providing affordable,
off-the-shelf robot platforms

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.030
such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.618
the Suitable Technologies beam,
only 17,000 dollars,

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.978
along with open-source robotics software

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:18.155
so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:21.039
And our hope is that, by providing these tools,

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:22.687
that you'll be able to think of better ways

00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:24.588
to provide movement for the disabled,

00:08:24.588 --> 00:08:27.310
to provide care for our aging population,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.294
to help better educate our children,

00:08:29.294 --> 00:08:31.608
to think about what the new types

00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:34.200
of middle class jobs could be for the future,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.803
to both monitor and protect our environment,

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:38.882
and to explore the universe.

00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:41.917
Back to you, Henry.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:45.599
HE: Thank you, Chad.

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:48.421
With this drone setup, we show the potential

00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:50.887
for bedridden people to once again be able

00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:53.558
to explore the outside world,

00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:55.935
and robotics will eventually provide

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.278
a level playing field

00:08:57.278 --> 00:08:59.981
where one is only limited by their mental acuity

00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:02.226
and imagination,

00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:04.385
where the disabled are able to perform

00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:07.080
the same activities as everyone else,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.982
and perhaps better,

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.622
and technology will even allow us to provide

00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:14.783
an outlet for many people who are presently

00:09:14.783 --> 00:09:17.211
considered vegetables.

00:09:17.211 --> 00:09:19.218
One hundred years ago,

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:22.569
I would have been treated like a vegetable.

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.999
Actually, that's not true.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.194
I would have died.

00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:30.016
It is up to us, all of us, to decide how

00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:33.381
robotics will be used, for good or for evil,

00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:35.006
for simply replacing people

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:36.643
or for making people better,

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:40.583
for allowing us to do and enjoy more.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:44.209
Our goal for robotics is to
unlock everyone's mental power

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.878
by making the world more physically accessible

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.421
to people such as myself and others like me

00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:51.603
around the globe.

00:09:51.603 --> 00:09:53.486
With the help of people like you,

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:56.626
we can make this dream a reality.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.307
Thank you.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:06.236
(Applause)
