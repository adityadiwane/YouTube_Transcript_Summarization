00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Cholera was reported in Haiti

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
for the first time in over 50 years

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
last October.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
There was no way to predict

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
how far it would spread through water supplies

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and how bad the situation would get.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And not knowing where help was needed

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
always ensured that help was in short supply

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
in the areas that needed it most.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
before they take innocent lives

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and cause irreversible damage,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
but we still can't do that with water,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and here's why.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Right now, if you want to test water in the field,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
you need a trained technician,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
expensive equipment like this,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and you have to wait about a day

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
It's too slow

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
to get a picture of conditions on the ground

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
before they change,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
too expensive to implement

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
in all the places that require testing.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
people still need to drink water.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
didn't come from testing water;

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
it came from forms like this,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
which documented all the people

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
we failed to help.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Countless lives have been saved

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
by canaries in coalmines --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a simple and invaluable way

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
for miners to know whether they're safe.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
one that can be used

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
by people who face conditions like this everyday.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
It's in its early stages,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
but this is what it looks like right now.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
We call it the Water Canary.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
It's a fast, cheap device

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that answers an important question:

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Is this water contaminated?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It doesn't require any special training.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
it uses light.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
That means there's no waiting

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
for chemical reactions to take place,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
no need to use reagents that can run out

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and no need to be an expert

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
to get actionable information.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
To test water, you simply insert a sample

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and, within seconds,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
This will make it possible

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
for anyone to collect life-saving information

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
We're also, on top of that,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
integrating wireless networking

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
into an affordable device

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
with GPS and GSM.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to be mapped in real time.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
With enough users,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
maps like this will make it possible

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
to take preventive action,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
containing hazards before they turn into emergencies

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that take years to recover from.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And then, instead of taking days

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
it can happen automatically.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
We've seen how distributed networks,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
big data and information

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
can transform society.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I think it's time for us to apply them to water.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and to open-source the hardware

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
so we can tackle this problem together.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Thank you.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
(Applause)
