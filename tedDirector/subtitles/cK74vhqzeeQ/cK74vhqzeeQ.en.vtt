00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:13.993
Could I protect my father

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:17.168
from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:18.729
That was the question I faced

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:21.497
one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:23.339
when I was a law student.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.277
I woke up early that morning

00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:26.397
in Dad's apartment

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:28.695
on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.969
to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.729
It was a season as described by a local paper

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.585
when every Tuesday a scholar fell

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.768
to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:43.130
My father's university teaching of Darwin

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.130
had already provoked a classroom visit

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.601
from the head of the so-called
Islamic Salvation Front,

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.657
who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:54.323
before Dad had ejected the man,

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:55.810
and now whoever was outside

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.910
would neither identify himself nor go away.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.882
So my father tried to get the police on the phone,

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.980
but perhaps terrified by the rising tide

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.404
of armed extremism that had already claimed

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:08.937
the lives of so many Algerian officers,

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.063
they didn't even answer.

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:13.402
And that was when I went to the kitchen,

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:14.777
got out a paring knife,

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:17.755
and took up a position inside the entryway.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.302
It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:21.151
but I couldn't think of anything else,

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.740
and so there I stood.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.247
When I look back now, I think
that that was the moment

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:28.761
that set me on the path was to writing a book

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.413
called "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:35.450
Untold Stories from the Fight
Against Muslim Fundamentalism."

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.416
The title comes from a Pakistani play.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.266
I think it was actually that moment

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.010
that sent me on the journey

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.960
to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.494
from nearly 30 countries,

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.910
from Afghanistan to Mali,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.251
to find out how they fought fundamentalism

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.479
peacefully like my father did,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.214
and how they coped with the attendant risks.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.431
Luckily, back in June of 1993,

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.263
our unidentified visitor went away,

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:06.308
but other families were so much less lucky,

00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:10.161
and that was the thought
that motivated my research.

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.691
In any case, someone would return

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.275
a few months later and leave a note

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:14.727
on Dad's kitchen table,

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:18.857
which simply said, "Consider yourself dead."

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:21.845
Subsequently, Algeria's
fundamentalist armed groups

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.908
would murder as many as 200,000 civilians

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:26.260
in what came to be known

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.138
as the dark decade of the 1990s,

00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:31.010
including every single one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.257
of the women that you see here.

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:37.130
In its harsh counterterrorist response,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.127
the state resorted to torture

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:40.838
and to forced disappearances,

00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:44.200
and as terrible as all of these events became,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.835
the international community largely ignored them.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:51.558
Finally, my father, an Algerian
peasant's son turned professor,

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:53.661
was forced to stop teaching at the university

00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.850
and to flee his apartment,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.223
but what I will never forget

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:59.458
about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.167
was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.941
he refused to leave the country

00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.999
and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.949
both of the fundamentalists

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.919
and sometimes of the government they battled.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.041
For example, in a November 1994 series

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.195
in the newspaper El Watan

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.704
entitled "How Fundamentalism

00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:22.246
Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,"

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:23.483
he denounced what he called

00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:26.816
the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:29.684
as it was lived by our ancestors.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:32.515
These were words that could get you killed.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:33.992
My father's country taught me

00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:36.546
in that dark decade of the 1990s that

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:39.954
the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.642
is one of the most important

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:44.173
and overlooked human rights struggles

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:45.928
in the world.

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:49.539
This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.120
You see, in every country

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.970
where you hear about armed jihadis

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.726
targeting civilians,

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.401
there are also unarmed people

00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:59.248
defying those militants that you don't hear about,

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:03.830
and those people need our support to succeed.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.648
In the West, it's often assumed

00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:08.685
that Muslims generally condone terrorism.

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:10.687
Some on the right think this because they view

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:12.950
Muslim culture as inherently violent,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.535
and some on the left imagine this

00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:16.323
because they view Muslim violence,

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:17.674
fundamentalist violence,

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:21.307
solely as a product of legitimate grievances.

00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:23.804
But both views are dead wrong.

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:25.619
In fact, many people of Muslim heritage

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.383
around the world are staunch opponents

00:04:28.383 --> 00:04:31.644
both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,

00:04:31.644 --> 00:04:34.110
and often for very good reason.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.150
You see, they're much more likely to be victims

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.305
of this violence than its perpetrators.

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:41.322
Let me just give you one example.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.165
According to a 2009 survey

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.505
of Arabic language media resources,

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:49.756
between 2004 and 2008,

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.880
no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.461
were Westerners.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.406
That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority

00:04:57.406 --> 00:04:59.175
were people of Muslim heritage,

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:01.991
killed by Muslim fundamentalists.

00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:04.819
Now I've been talking for the last five minutes

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.302
about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:08.996
exactly what I mean.

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:12.901
I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.940
Marieme Helie Lucas,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.336
and she says that fundamentalisms,

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:19.834
note the "s," so within all of the world's

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:21.656
great religious traditions,

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:25.627
"fundamentalisms are political
movements of the extreme right

00:05:25.627 --> 00:05:27.790
which in a context of globalization

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.284
manipulate religion in order to achieve

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:31.933
their political aims."

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:35.616
Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization

00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:37.127
of theology.

00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:39.542
Now I want to avoid projecting the notion

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:41.328
that there's sort of a monolith out there

00:05:41.328 --> 00:05:44.541
called Muslim fundamentalism
that is the same everywhere,

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:47.257
because these movements
also have their diversities.

00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:49.720
Some use and advocate violence.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.350
Some do not, though they're often interrelated.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.920
They take different forms.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.544
Some may be non-governmental organizations,

00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:59.076
even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:01.169
Some may become political parties,

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.740
like the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.458
and some may be openly armed groups

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:06.183
like the Taliban.

00:06:06.183 --> 00:06:09.504
But in any case, these are all radical projects.

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:12.733
They're not conservative or traditional approaches.

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:15.946
They're most often about changing
people's relationship with Islam

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:17.501
rather than preserving it.

00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:20.891
What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,

00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:22.890
and the fact that its adherents are

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.730
or purport to be Muslim

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.140
makes them no less offensive

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.631
than the extreme right anywhere else.

00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:30.498
So in my view, if we consider ourselves

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:32.248
liberal or left-wing,

00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:34.708
human rights-loving or feminist,

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.909
we must oppose these movements

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:39.754
and support their grassroots opponents.

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:41.370
Now let me be clear

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.372
that I support an effective struggle

00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:45.317
against fundamentalism,

00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:47.597
but also a struggle that must itself

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:49.535
respect international law,

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:51.964
so nothing I am saying should be taken

00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:53.809
as a justification for refusals

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.274
to democratize,

00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:57.949
and here I send out a shout-out of support

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.000
to the pro-democracy movement 
in Algeria today, Barakat.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.282
Nor should anything I say be taken

00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:07.149
as a justification of violations of human rights,

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.555
like the mass death sentences

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:11.475
handed out in Egypt earlier this week.

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.998
But what I am saying

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:16.305
is that we must challenge these
Muslim fundamentalist movements

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.123
because they threaten human rights

00:07:18.123 --> 00:07:20.706
across Muslim-majority contexts,

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:23.087
and they do this in a range of ways,

00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:26.050
most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.289
by the armed groups that carry those out.

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.336
But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.127
These movements as a whole purvey discrimination

00:07:34.127 --> 00:07:37.448
against religious minorities and sexual minorities.

00:07:37.448 --> 00:07:39.528
They seek to curtail the freedom of religion

00:07:39.528 --> 00:07:42.427
of everyone who either practices in a different way

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.391
or chooses not to practice.

00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.815
And most definingly, they lead an all-out war

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:49.896
on the rights of women.

00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:51.692
Now, faced with these movements

00:07:51.692 --> 00:07:53.264
in recent years, Western discourse

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.899
has most often offered

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.156
two flawed responses.

00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.719
The first that one sometimes finds on the right

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:02.261
suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist

00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:05.607
or something about Islam is
inherently fundamentalist,

00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:08.898
and this is just offensive and wrong,

00:08:08.898 --> 00:08:11.306
but unfortunately on the left
one sometimes encounters

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:13.488
a discourse that is too politically correct

00:08:13.488 --> 00:08:17.290
to acknowledge the problem of
Muslim fundamentalism at all

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.651
or, even worse, apologizes for it,

00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:22.199
and this is unacceptable as well.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.261
So what I'm seeking is a new way

00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.382
of talking about this all together,

00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:29.110
which is grounded in the lived experiences

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.059
and the hope of the people on the front lines.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.010
I'm painfully aware that there has been

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.191
an increase in discrimination
against Muslims in recent years

00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:39.662
in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,

00:08:39.662 --> 00:08:42.716
and that too is a matter of grave concern,

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:43.855
but I firmly believe

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.816
that telling these counter-stereotypical stories

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:48.142
of people of Muslim heritage

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:50.314
who have confronted the fundamentalists

00:08:50.314 --> 00:08:52.329
and been their primary victims

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:56.906
is also a great way of countering that discrimination.

00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:58.686
So now let me introduce you

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.342
to four people whose stories

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:03.558
I had the great honor of telling.

00:09:03.558 --> 00:09:05.791
Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:07.793
workshop named for his father

00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:09.931
have for years promoted the performing arts

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.663
in Pakistan.

00:09:11.663 --> 00:09:13.124
With the rise of jihadist violence,

00:09:13.124 --> 00:09:14.700
they began to receive threats

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.950
to call off their events, which they refused to heed.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.220
And so a bomber struck their 2008

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.104
eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,

00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:25.792
producing rain of glass

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:27.457
that fell into the venue

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:29.392
injuring nine people,

00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:30.960
and later that same night,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.711
the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:

00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:35.580
they announced that their festival

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.987
would continue as planned the next day.

00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:40.438
As Faizan said at the time,

00:09:40.438 --> 00:09:42.380
if we bow down to the Islamists,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.491
we'll just be sitting in a dark corner.

00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:47.149
But they didn't know what would happen.

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:49.586
Would anyone come?

00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:52.475
In fact, thousands of people came out the next day

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:54.877
to support the performing arts in Lahore,

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:56.722
and this simultaneously thrilled

00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:58.544
and terrified Faizan,

00:09:58.544 --> 00:09:59.997
and he ran up to a woman

00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:02.214
who had come in with her two small children,

00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:05.408
and he said, "You do know there
was a bomb here yesterday,

00:10:05.408 --> 00:10:07.735
and you do know there's a threat here today."

00:10:07.735 --> 00:10:09.618
And she said, "I know that,

00:10:09.618 --> 00:10:11.182
but I came to your festival

00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:13.612
with my mother when I was their age,

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.660
and I still have those images in my mind.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.798
We have to be here."

00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:20.655
With stalwart audiences like this,

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:22.309
the Peerzadas were able to conclude

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.769
their festival on schedule.

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:26.006
And then the next year,

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.889
they lost all of their sponsors

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:30.258
due to the security risk.

00:10:30.258 --> 00:10:32.558
So when I met them in 2010,

00:10:32.558 --> 00:10:34.844
they were in the middle of the first subsequent event

00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:37.910
that they were able to have in the same venue,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.174
and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:44.149
held in Lahore in a year when that city

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:48.219
had already experienced 44 terror attacks.

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:50.322
This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:52.139
had commenced their systematic targeting

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:54.347
of girls' schools that would culminate

00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:57.106
in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:01.501
What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?

00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.674
They staged girls' school theater.

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:07.486
So I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:10.118
which was a musical in the Punjabi language,

00:11:10.118 --> 00:11:11.880
and the girls of Lahore Grammar School

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.606
played all the parts.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:14.840
They sang and danced,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.498
they played the mice and the water buffalo,

00:11:17.498 --> 00:11:19.962
and I held my breath, wondering,

00:11:19.962 --> 00:11:21.229
would we get to the end

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:23.515
of this amazing show?

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:26.071
And when we did, the whole audience

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.809
collectively exhaled,

00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:30.073
and a few people actually wept,

00:11:30.073 --> 00:11:32.596
and then they filled the auditorium

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:35.435
with the peaceful boom of their applause.

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:38.422
And I remember thinking in that moment

00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:40.853
that the bombers made headlines here

00:11:40.853 --> 00:11:42.516
two years before

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:44.880
but this night and these people

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.171
are as important a story.

00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:52.968
Maria Bashir is the first and only

00:11:52.968 --> 00:11:56.092
woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.

00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:58.306
She's been in the post since 2008

00:11:58.306 --> 00:12:00.492
and actually opened an office to investigate

00:12:00.492 --> 00:12:02.318
cases of violence against women,

00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:04.576
which she says is the most important area

00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:06.310
in her mandate.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.375
When I meet her in her office in Herat,

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:11.120
she enters surrounded by

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.486
four large men with four huge guns.

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:17.450
In fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.870
because she has weathered bomb attacks

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.548
that nearly killed her kids,

00:12:20.548 --> 00:12:23.899
and it took the leg off of one of her guards.

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:26.009
Why does she continue?

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.663
She says with a smile that that is the question

00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:30.710
that everyone asks—

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.535
as she puts it, "Why you risk not living?"

00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:36.174
And it is simply that for her,

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:39.643
a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come

00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:41.127
is worth the risk,

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.837
and she knows that if people like her

00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:44.752
do not take the risk,

00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:47.049
there will be no better future.

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:48.776
Later on in our interview,

00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:51.139
Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:52.658
about the possible outcome

00:12:52.658 --> 00:12:55.157
of government negotiations with the Taliban,

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:57.551
the people who have been trying to kill her.

00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:59.303
"If we give them a place in the government,"

00:12:59.303 --> 00:13:02.520
she asks, "Who will protect women's rights?"

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.886
And she urges the international community

00:13:04.886 --> 00:13:07.518
not to forget its promise about women

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:11.345
because now they want peace with Taliban.

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.550
A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.425
I see a headline on the Internet.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:20.030
An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.166
I google desperately,

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:23.840
and thankfully that day I find out

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.926
that Maria was not the victim,

00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:28.149
though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:30.180
was gunned down on his way to work.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.175
And when I hear headlines like that now,

00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:35.473
I think that as international troops

00:13:35.473 --> 00:13:38.521
leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,

00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:40.427
we must continue to care

00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:41.860
about what happens to people there,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.886
to all of the Maria Bashirs.

00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:47.499
Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head

00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:50.580
saying, with no bravado whatsoever,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.185
"The situation of the women of Afghanistan

00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:55.091
will be better someday.

00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:57.326
We should prepare the ground for this,

00:13:57.326 --> 00:14:00.269
even if we are killed."

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:03.502
There are no words adequate

00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:05.478
to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.740
who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.202
on the same day as a children's cooking competition

00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:13.620
in September of 2013.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.119
They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:20.218
Far away in the American Midwest,

00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:22.565
I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans

00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:25.413
who were working to counter
the efforts of al Shabaab

00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:27.637
to recruit a small number of young people

00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:29.581
from their city of Minneapolis

00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:33.279
to take part in atrocities like Westgate.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.239
Abdirizak Bihi's studious

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.128
17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.776
was recruited here in 2008,

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:42.536
spirited to Somalia,

00:14:42.536 --> 00:14:45.906
and then killed when he tried to come home.

00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:47.500
Since that time, Mr. Bihi,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.753
who directs the no-budget Somali
Education and Advocacy Center,

00:14:51.753 --> 00:14:54.204
has been vocally denouncing the recruitment

00:14:54.204 --> 00:14:56.060
and the failures of government

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.279
and Somali-American institutions

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:01.304
like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center

00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:03.535
where he believes his nephew was radicalized

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.641
during a youth program.

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:07.794
But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:09.373
He also takes on the government

00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:11.158
for its failure to do more

00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:13.656
to prevent poverty in his community.

00:15:13.656 --> 00:15:15.945
Given his own lack of financial resources,

00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:18.256
Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.

00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:20.150
To counter the efforts of al Shabaab

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.535
to sway more disaffected youth,

00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.970
in the wake of the group's 2010 attack

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.564
on World Cup viewers in Uganda,

00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:30.904
he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament

00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:33.436
in Minneapolis in response.

00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:36.120
Scores of Somali-American kids came out

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.508
to embrace sport

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:40.000
despite the fatwa against it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.745
They played basketball

00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:45.612
as Burhan Hassan never would again.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.262
For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized

00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:51.334
by the leadership of the Abubakar
As-Saddique Islamic Center,

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:53.899
with which he used to have good relations.

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:56.285
He told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV

00:15:56.285 --> 00:15:58.343
calling us infidels and saying,

00:15:58.343 --> 00:16:01.912
'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"

00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:03.323
This is at complete odds

00:16:03.323 --> 00:16:05.856
with how Abdirizak Bihi understands

00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:07.656
what he is trying to do

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:10.062
by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,

00:16:10.062 --> 00:16:12.484
which is to save the religion I love

00:16:12.484 --> 00:16:15.610
from a small number of extremists.

00:16:16.938 --> 00:16:19.499
Now I want to tell one last story,

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:22.513
that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria

00:16:22.513 --> 00:16:24.459
named Amel Zenoune-Zouani

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:26.338
who had the same dreams of a legal career

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:29.040
that I did back in the '90s.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.969
She refused to give up her studies,

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:32.938
despite the fact that the fundamentalists

00:16:32.938 --> 00:16:35.468
battling the Algerian state back then

00:16:35.468 --> 00:16:39.090
threatened all who continued their education.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.200
On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.122
in Algiers where she was studying

00:16:45.122 --> 00:16:47.305
to go home and spend a Ramadan evening

00:16:47.305 --> 00:16:48.994
with her family,

00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:51.380
and would never finish law school.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.840
When the bus reached the outskirts

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.615
of her hometown, it was stopped

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.757
at a checkpoint manned by men

00:16:56.757 --> 00:16:59.051
from the Armed Islamic Group.

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.780
Carrying her schoolbag,

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.766
Amel was taken off the bus

00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.355
and killed in the street.

00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:06.491
The men who cut her throat

00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:08.341
then told everyone else,

00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:10.235
"If you go to university,

00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:12.789
the day will come when we will kill all of you

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:16.020
just like this."

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.720
Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.568
which we know because when she fell in the street,

00:17:21.568 --> 00:17:23.345
her watch broke.

00:17:23.345 --> 00:17:24.574
Her mother showed me the watch

00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:26.575
with the second hand still aimed

00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:28.071
optimistically upward

00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:31.507
towards a 5:18 that would never come.

00:17:31.507 --> 00:17:32.656
Shortly before her death,

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:34.511
Amel had said to her mother of herself

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.398
and her sisters,

00:17:36.398 --> 00:17:40.015
"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,

00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:41.885
but if something happens,

00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:44.768
you must know that we are dead for knowledge.

00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:48.978
You and father must keep your heads held high."

00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:52.960
The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.515
and so as I did my research

00:17:54.515 --> 00:17:57.769
I found myself searching for Amel's hope again

00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:00.706
and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.

00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:03.957
I think I found it in two places.

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:06.252
The first is in the strength of her family

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.518
and all the other families to
continue telling their stories

00:18:09.518 --> 00:18:12.583
and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:15.865
In fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:17.236
went to law school,

00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:19.990
and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.591
something which is only possible

00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:22.780
because the armed fundamentalists

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.658
were largely defeated in the country.

00:18:25.658 --> 00:18:28.505
And the second place I found Amel's hope

00:18:28.505 --> 00:18:30.977
was everywhere that women and men

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.672
continue to defy the jihadis.

00:18:33.672 --> 00:18:36.930
We must support all of those in honor of Amel

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.563
who continue this human rights struggle today,

00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:43.560
like the Network of Women
Living Under Muslim Laws.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.187
It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate

00:18:46.187 --> 00:18:48.074
Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,

00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:51.139
it is not enough just to battle terrorism.

00:18:51.139 --> 00:18:53.683
We must also challenge fundamentalism,

00:18:53.683 --> 00:18:56.120
because fundamentalism is the ideology

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.711
that makes the bed of this terrorism.

00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:02.150
Why is it that people like her, like all of them

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.844
are not more well known?

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:07.121
Why is it that everyone knows
who Osama bin Laden was

00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:09.054
and so few know of all of those

00:19:09.054 --> 00:19:12.747
standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.

00:19:12.747 --> 00:19:15.404
We must change that, and so I ask you

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.172
to please help share these stories

00:19:17.172 --> 00:19:18.945
through your networks.

00:19:18.945 --> 00:19:21.044
Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch,

00:19:21.044 --> 00:19:22.704
forever frozen,

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:25.066
and now please look at your own watch

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:28.090
and decide this is the moment that you commit

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.998
to supporting people like Amel.

00:19:29.998 --> 00:19:32.379
We don't have the right to be silent about them

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:33.877
because it is easier

00:19:33.877 --> 00:19:36.738
or because Western policy is flawed as well,

00:19:36.738 --> 00:19:39.074
because 5:17 is still coming

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:40.941
to too many Amel Zenounes

00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:42.911
in places like northern Nigeria,

00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:45.487
where jihadis still kill students.

00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:48.568
The time to speak up in support of all of those

00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:50.876
who peacefully challenge fundamentalism

00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:53.840
and terrorism in their own communities

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.376
is now.

00:19:55.376 --> 00:19:57.659
Thank you.

00:19:57.659 --> 00:20:00.165
(Applause)
