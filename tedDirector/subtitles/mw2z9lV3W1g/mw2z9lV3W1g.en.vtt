00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:15.535
Once upon a time,

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:18.975
there was a place called Lesterland.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.930
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.667
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.005
and of that 311 million people,

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.888
it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:35.016
If Matt's in the audience,

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:37.706
I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:40.371
this character from your series.

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.794
So 144,000 are called Lester,

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:47.074
which means about .05 percent is named Lester.

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:50.802
Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:53.965
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.178
One is called the general election.

00:00:56.178 --> 00:00:59.519
The other is called the Lester election.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.504
And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:05.776
but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.

00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:06.910
And here's the trick.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.561
In order to run in the general election,

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.107
you must do extremely well

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.480
in the Lester election.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.581
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.

00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.531
Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:22.924
What we can say, number one,

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:25.560
as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.838
that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,

00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:32.486
because, after all, there is a general election,

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:35.438
but only after the Lesters have had their way

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:38.940
with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.543
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters

00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:45.305
is going to produce a subtle, understated,

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.734
we could say camouflaged, bending

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.925
to keep the Lesters happy.

00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:54.194
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.870
but it's dependent upon the Lesters

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.880
and dependent upon the people.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.522
It has competing dependencies,

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:02.932
we could say conflicting dependencies,

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:07.202
depending upon who the Lesters are.

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:09.546
Okay. That's Lesterland.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.305
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:15.546
Number one, the United States is Lesterland.

00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:17.422
The United States is Lesterland.

00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:19.803
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:22.942
one we called the general election,

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:26.186
the second we should call the money election.

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:28.352
In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:30.946
if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:34.162
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,

00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:36.922
the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:39.081
the trick is, to run in the general election,

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.901
you must do extremely well in the money election.

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.522
You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:47.074
But you must do extremely well.

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:51.602
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:57.091
in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.

00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:58.995
Now you say, really?

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:02.138
Really .05 percent?

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:04.354
Well, here are the numbers from 2010:

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:06.650
.26 percent of America

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.386
gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:13.850
.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.282
.01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent --

00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:20.490
gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.566
and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:27.421
is .000042 percent

00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:31.458
— for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans —

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:35.418
gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent

00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:38.168
in the cycle we have just seen ending.

00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:40.898
So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,

00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:42.607
and I say it's fair for me to say

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:46.858
it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.

00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:50.160
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.660
Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.002
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.839
we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:02.868
over the elected officials. We have a general election,

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.077
but only after the funders have had their way

00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:10.240
with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.763
And number two, obviously,

00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:15.035
this dependence upon the funders

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:18.967
produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.604
to keep the funders happy.

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:24.648
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress

00:04:24.648 --> 00:04:28.931
spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:31.107
raising money to get back to Congress

00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:32.882
or to get their party back into power,

00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:36.307
and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,

00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:38.424
these humans, as they spend their time

00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:41.843
behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:45.311
but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.679
As anyone would, as they do this,

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:51.527
they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:54.867
about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:56.283
They become, in the words of "The X-Files,"

00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:59.727
shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views

00:04:59.727 --> 00:05:02.589
in light of what they know will help them to raise money,

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:04.158
not on issues one to 10,

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:07.253
but on issues 11 to 1,000.

00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:08.967
Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:10.577
describes that when she went to Congress,

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:14.502
she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:16.138
Then to clarify, she went on,

00:05:16.138 --> 00:05:20.832
"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter)

00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:22.912
So here too we have a democracy,

00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:24.927
a democracy dependent upon the funders

00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:26.714
and dependent upon the people,

00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:28.851
competing dependencies,

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.870
possibly conflicting dependencies

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.481
depending upon who the funders are.

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:37.242
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.

00:05:37.242 --> 00:05:39.253
Here's point number two.

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:42.035
The United States is worse than Lesterland,

00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:44.916
worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.268
if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:50.532
"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"

00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:54.683
we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:56.972
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.

00:05:56.972 --> 00:05:59.620
There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.348
not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.

00:06:02.348 --> 00:06:04.476
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:07.484
"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"

00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:12.259
It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.502
But in our land, in this land, in USA-land,

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:18.125
there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.097
many of them in this room here today,

00:06:20.097 --> 00:06:24.581
but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,

00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:28.969
because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.094
are not comprising it for the public interest.

00:06:31.094 --> 00:06:35.486
It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:37.907
And finally, point number three:

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.854
Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland,

00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:43.158
against the background of its history, its traditions,

00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:48.101
in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,

00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:49.574
a corruption.

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:53.597
Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash

00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:55.465
secreted among members of Congress.

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:58.525
I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.

00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.430
I don't mean any criminal act.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.821
The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.

00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:08.874
It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.

00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:12.369
The framers gave us what they called a republic,

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:16.551
but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.738
and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:22.717
as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch

00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:27.662
that would be dependent upon the people alone.

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:28.677
So here's the model of government.

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.282
They have the people and the government

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:33.715
with this exclusive dependency,

00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:37.818
but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,

00:07:37.818 --> 00:07:40.491
no longer a dependence upon the people alone,

00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.920
increasingly a dependence upon the funders.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.058
Now this is a dependence too,

00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:49.922
but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone

00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:54.228
so long as the funders are not the people.

00:07:54.228 --> 00:07:56.491
This is a corruption.

00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:58.991
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.

00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:01.355
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.525
equal-opportunity corruption.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:08.178
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:10.650
It blocks the right too, as it makes

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.570
principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.762
So the right wants smaller government.

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.458
When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:23.370
for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.050
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.083
and as he reported back to me,

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:30.282
the response was, "Hell no!

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:32.058
If we deregulate these guys,

00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:35.816
how are we going to raise money from them?"

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:39.623
This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:43.256
including the status quo of big and invasive government.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.706
It works against the left and the right,

00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:47.252
and that, you might say, is good news.

00:08:47.252 --> 00:08:49.041
But here's the bad news.

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:52.944
It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,

00:08:52.944 --> 00:08:55.200
because in any system

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.100
where the members are dependent upon

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.272
the tiniest fraction of us for their election,

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:03.064
that means the tiniest number of us,

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:05.344
the tiniest, tiniest number of us,

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.055
can block reform.

00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:09.953
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.

00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:11.990
I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.384
Block reform.

00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:18.360
Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.914
an economy with lobbyists at the center

00:09:20.914 --> 00:09:23.568
which feeds on polarization.

00:09:23.568 --> 00:09:25.417
It feeds on dysfunction.

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:28.056
The worse that it is for us,

00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:31.992
the better that it is for this fundraising.

00:09:31.992 --> 00:09:35.104
Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking

00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:39.976
at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:43.369
This is the root.

00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:47.512
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.

00:09:47.512 --> 00:09:51.141
You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.

00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:54.725
You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.

00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:57.273
You focus on the possible problems,

00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.536
like eradicating polio from the world,

00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:03.670
or taking an image of every single street across the globe,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.976
or building the first real universal translator,

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:10.578
or building a fusion factory in your garage.

00:10:10.578 --> 00:10:13.496
These are the manageable problems, so you ignore —

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:19.128
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:21.577
so you ignore this corruption.

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:27.047
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.

00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:30.152
(Applause)

00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:33.735
We need a government that works.

00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:36.600
And not works for the left or the right,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.064
but works for the left and the right,

00:10:39.064 --> 00:10:41.096
the citizens of the left and right,

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:44.688
because there is no sensible reform possible

00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:47.217
until we end this corruption.

00:10:47.217 --> 00:10:51.402
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.962
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform

00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:56.330
or a simpler tax system or inequality.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.518
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,

00:10:58.518 --> 00:11:02.359
look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:04.185
There will never be a Christmas.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:06.897
We will never get your issue solved

00:11:06.897 --> 00:11:09.863
until we fix this issue first.

00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:13.193
So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.

00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:17.369
Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,

00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:20.090
the issue we have to solve before we get to fix

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.063
the issues you care about.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:25.361
No sensible reform, and we cannot afford

00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:29.282
a world, a future, with no sensible reform.

00:11:29.282 --> 00:11:32.153
Okay. So how do we do it?

00:11:32.153 --> 00:11:35.641
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.491
If the problem is members spending an extraordinary

00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.651
amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:45.911
the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.579
but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:49.752
to spread it out,

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:53.033
to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:56.225
of dependence upon the people alone.

00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:59.655
And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:00.914
changing the First Amendment.

00:12:00.914 --> 00:12:04.273
To do this would require a single statute,

00:12:04.273 --> 00:12:06.465
a statute establishing what we think of

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:09.161
as small dollar funded elections,

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.369
a statute of citizen-funded campaigns,

00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:13.465
and there's any number of these proposals out there:

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:14.911
Fair Elections Now Act,

00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.337
the American Anti-Corruption Act,

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:20.427
an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:22.761
to give vouchers to people to fund elections,

00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:25.956
an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.

00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:30.060
Each of these would fix this corruption

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.409
by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.

00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:37.067
The analytics are easy here.

00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:42.580
It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:48.939
because this reform would shrink K Street,

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:53.799
and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:56.779
a Democrat from Tennessee, put it,

00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:01.599
has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:03.564
Members and staffers and bureaucrats have

00:13:03.564 --> 00:13:05.775
an increasingly common business model in their head,

00:13:05.775 --> 00:13:08.843
a business model focused on their life after government,

00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:11.164
their life as lobbyists.

00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:14.710
Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.368
left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.

00:13:17.368 --> 00:13:18.844
Those numbers have only gone up,

00:13:18.844 --> 00:13:21.190
and as United Republic calculated last April,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.403
the average increase in salary for those who they tracked

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:29.765
was 1,452 percent.

00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:36.131
So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:40.195
Now I get this skepticism.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:45.131
I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.

00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:47.459
But I don't buy it.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:51.307
This is a solvable issue.

00:13:51.307 --> 00:13:54.467
If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.306
in the 20th century,

00:13:56.306 --> 00:13:59.587
issues like racism, or sexism,

00:13:59.587 --> 00:14:02.700
or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.187
those are hard issues.

00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:08.107
You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.

00:14:08.107 --> 00:14:12.418
It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.863
out of the soul of a people.

00:14:14.863 --> 00:14:18.108
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.651
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.338
and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems

00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:26.468
have seen overnight a change in the practice.

00:14:26.468 --> 00:14:28.449
When Connecticut adopted this system,

00:14:28.449 --> 00:14:32.639
in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:36.886
gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:38.865
It's solvable,

00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:41.675
not by being a Democrat,

00:14:41.675 --> 00:14:43.470
not by being a Republican.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.122
It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,

00:14:47.122 --> 00:14:50.105
by being TEDizens.

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:54.442
Because if you want to kickstart reform,

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:57.893
look, I could kickstart reform

00:14:57.893 --> 00:15:01.481
at half the price of fixing energy policy,

00:15:01.481 --> 00:15:04.263
I could give you back a republic.

00:15:04.263 --> 00:15:07.907
Okay. But even if you're not yet with me,

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:11.492
even if you believe this is impossible,

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:14.929
what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:17.527
as I've spoken about this issue again and again is,

00:15:17.527 --> 00:15:21.353
even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.341
Irrelevant.

00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:26.909
I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.752
I write in my book, and she said to me,

00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:34.445
"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.

00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:37.295
There's nothing we can do."

00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:39.220
When she said that, I scrambled.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.362
I tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?

00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:43.025
What is that sense of hopelessness?"

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:47.887
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.

00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:51.072
And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,

00:15:51.072 --> 00:15:58.381
"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.

00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:00.635
Nothing you can do."

00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:03.730
So would I do nothing?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.102
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?

00:16:06.102 --> 00:16:09.925
I'm going off to build Google Glass.

00:16:09.925 --> 00:16:13.571
Of course not. I would do everything I could,

00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:17.151
and I would do everything I could because this is what love means,

00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:19.467
that the odds are irrelevant and that you do

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:23.046
whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.

00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:26.887
And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:29.146
love this country.

00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:32.119
(Laughter)

00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:34.379
And so when the pundits and the politicians

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.689
say that change is impossible,

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:39.751
what this love of country says back is,

00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:42.487
"That's just irrelevant."

00:16:42.487 --> 00:16:44.527
We lose something dear,

00:16:44.527 --> 00:16:47.734
something everyone in this room loves and cherishes,

00:16:47.734 --> 00:16:51.682
if we lose this republic, and so we act

00:16:51.682 --> 00:16:56.976
with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.

00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:59.412
So here's my question:

00:16:59.412 --> 00:17:04.023
Do you have that love?

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.848
Do you have that love?

00:17:06.848 --> 00:17:08.531
Because if you do,

00:17:08.531 --> 00:17:13.920
then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.460
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.466
in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,

00:17:22.466 --> 00:17:25.924
"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:33.685
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:38.584
A republic. A representative democracy.

00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:45.793
A government dependent upon the people alone.

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:50.378
We have lost that republic.

00:17:50.378 --> 00:17:54.726
All of us have to act to get it back.

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:56.370
Thank you very much.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:02.423
(Applause)

00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:13.099
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
