00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Now, since this is TEDGlobal,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
who can tell me what this is called in French?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
"vielle Ã  roue."

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And in Spanish, "zanfona."

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that uses a crank to turn a wheel

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to produce music.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
It has three different kinds of strings.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
The first string is the drone string,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The second string is a melody string,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And the third string is pretty innovative.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
It's also the only instrument

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
that uses this kind of technique.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
it makes a sound like a barking dog.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
So all of this is pretty innovative,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
if you consider

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and it took two people to play it;

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
one to turn the crank,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So, one person could actually play

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and almost -- this is pretty heavy --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
carry the hurdy-gurdy.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in mostly dance music

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
because of the uniqueness of the melody

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
combined with the acoustic boombox here.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
traditional folk music,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
dance, contemporary

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and world music --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in the U.K., in France, in Spain

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and in Italy.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
It's made by specialized luthiers,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
also in Europe.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And it's very difficult to tune.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
(Audience: Yes.)

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
CP: Okay.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
There I go.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I'd like to sing in Basque,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
in the region in France and Spain.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Music)

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.260
[Basque]

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.260
(Music)

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Thank you.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Applause)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
This is a song that I wrote

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
based on traditional Basque rhythms.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Music)

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
(Applause)
