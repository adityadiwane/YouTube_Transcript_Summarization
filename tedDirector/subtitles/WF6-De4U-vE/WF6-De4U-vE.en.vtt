00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Cartoons are basically short stories.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Not all of them have happy endings.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
So how did I get started cartooning?

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I doodled a lot as a kid,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and if you spend enough time doodling,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
sooner or later, something happens:

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
all your career options run out.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
So you have to make a living cartooning.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
when I was about eight or nine.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
This is some of my early work.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
so it was [unclear].

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that really made me see the ocean differently,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and it's become the foundation of my work

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
because, I feel like, if in a day,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I can see the ocean differently,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
especially kids.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
It's just a big blue surface.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It's a mystery.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
There's been a lot of folklore

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
developed around the ocean,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
mostly negative.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And that prompted people to make maps like this,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
but when you get to the waters edge,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
as if to say, "All geography and science lessons

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
stop at water's edge.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
This part's not going to be on the test."

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
But that day I flew low over the islands --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I saw forests and meadows.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I saw grottoes and secret gardens

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and places I'd love to hide as a kid,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
if I could only breathe underwater.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And best of all, I saw the animals.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
walking around on dry land,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
but my head was down there, underwater.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Up until that day,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
these were the animals that were most common in my life.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
These were the ones I'd like to draw --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
all variations of four legs and fur.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
But when you got to the ocean,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
my imagination was no competition for nature.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and this enormous humpback whale

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
was like something out of a science-fiction movie.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
animals as big as office buildings

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
still swimming around out there in our ocean.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
the same fish they were 300 million years ago.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that's what a dinosaur looks like.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So you have living dinosaurs

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and space aliens,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
could come up with something more interesting than that.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
make it look like it's floating in outer space.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and we saw that?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It would start a whole new space race.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
as a society.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
We say to ourselves,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So, what I'd like to do now

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
is try a little drawing.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
I love to draw the deep sea fish,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
because they are so ugly,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
but beautiful in their own way.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
give him a headlight,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
maybe a brake light,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
turn signals.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
But it's easy to see why these animals

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
make such great cartoon characters,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
their shapes and sizes.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So some of them actually seem to have powers

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
like superheroes in a comic book.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
For instance,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
take these sea turtles.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
They kind of have a sixth sense

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
like Superman's x-ray vision.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And they can use that sense

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I kind of give my turtle hands

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Or take this sea cucumber.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
or draw at all.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
He's like an underwater Spiderman.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
He shoots out these sticky webs

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to entangle his enemy.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
(Laughter)

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
(Laughter)

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Or the blowfish.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
It can change its body

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
into a big, intimidating fish

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
in a matter of seconds.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And then I'm going to attempt

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
onscreen animation here.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Let's see.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Try and inflate it.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
(Laughter)

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
when he wants to be intimidating.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Or take this swordfish.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
"Somebody's getting stabbed today."

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Or this lionfish for instance.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Imagine trying to make friends

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
My characters are --

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
my lead character's a shark named Sherman.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
He's a great white shark.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
I didn't want to go with this ruthless

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
predator image.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
He's kind of just out there making a living.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And then his sidekick

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And he does manage to find them,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
He never seems

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
to settle on

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
any particular girl.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
so he kind of wishes

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
he were a great white shark.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And then I'll introduce you to one more character,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
this guy, Ernest,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
who is basically a juvenile delinquent

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
in a fish body.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So with characters, you can make stories.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Sometimes making a story is as easy

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
as putting two characters in a room

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and seeing what happens.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
(Laughter)

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Or, sometimes I take them to places

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
that people have never heard of because they're underwater.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
where they met giant jellyfish.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
This next one here,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
I did a story on the census of marine life.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
it's a real project we've heard about.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to a lot of crazy undersea characters.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
So we start off the story with Ernest,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
who volunteers as a census taker.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Then he meets the yeti crab,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
I did another story on marine debris.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
I was speaking to a lot of my friends

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
in the conservation business,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and they --

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And they said -- this one friend of mine said,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
"I've got one word for you: plastic."

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Plastic just is not going to do it."

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
We sort of worked things out.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
I couldn't fit them in.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
What I'm trying to tell readers

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
is that plastic doesn't really go away;

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
it just continues to wash downstream.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
where they dropped a plastic bottle

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
into the Boise sewer system.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And it ended up in the Boise River

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and then on to the Columbia River

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and then to the mouth of the Columbia

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and to the Pacific Ocean

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and then back onto the lagoon.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So that was basically a buddy story

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
with a plastic bottle following along.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
but we really talked about marine debris and plastic

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
in the course of that one.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
was probably my most difficult.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
about this issue.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Now, finning is the act

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and throwing the live animal back in the water.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
It's cruel, it's wasteful.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
but I really wanted to take this issue on.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
which he does.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And then he dies.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Ostensibly, he's dead now.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
I do three or four strips after that

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
where we explore the finning issue

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and the shark fin soup issue.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Sherman's up in shark heaven.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
This is what I love about comic strips, you know.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
because, if you start with a talking shark,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
You can kind of do anything.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
There was a real website based in China

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
that actually sold shark fins,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
so I kind of exposed that.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And he clicks the "buy now" button.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And voila, next-day air, they show up,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and they surgically reattach them.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
to force other countries

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
to have a stronger stance with shark management.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
(Applause)

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Thanks.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and this is what I came up with.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Imagine you're in an enormous room,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and it's as dark as a cave.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
but you can't see anything.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
You've been given one tool, a hammer.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and it feels like it's made of stone.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And you take the piece out into the daylight.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
So you go back into the room,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And you hear other people doing the same thing.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
So you get this sense of urgency,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And then some yells, "Stop!"

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And they turn up the lights.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And that's what we're doing with the ocean.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And part of what Mission Blue is about

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
is yelling, "Stop!"

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
so that each of us --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
can turn up the lights in their own way.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
That's why I like what I do.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Thanks for listening.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
(Applause)
