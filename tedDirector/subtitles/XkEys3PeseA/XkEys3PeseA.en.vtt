00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and here's yet another New York Times article,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
just like every other darn one you've seen.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And the reason I'm saying this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we may be on the road to a solution.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The fact is -- uh-uh.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And we've accomplished close to zip.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You've seen this in various forms,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but maybe you haven't seen this one.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And that it's accelerating even faster

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the environmentalists only put in the projections

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to make the projections look as bad as possible,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But in fact, they're growing faster.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't want to depress you too much.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
dealing with electricity production,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Instead, we spend our time talking.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They will completely lose.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And there's no adaption.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So this problem is absolutely soluble.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I know for certain that that will work.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the reason is, it's been done.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The result of that was pretty dramatic.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and it heats up after these volcanoes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
There's no big mystery about it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But it clearly cools down.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And one other thing: it's fast.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is the sum of emissions over time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But if you do this, it's quick.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And there are times you might like to do something quick.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And the answer seems to be yes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and you're back to the original climate.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
"Geo-engineering won't work."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And to the person who was promoting it said,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
"The atmosphere's much more complicated."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This topic is also old.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
1965.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We should, but it made exactly this point.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So, in a sense, there's not much new.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The one new thing is this essay.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
we should think about things like this.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He said roughly what's been said before.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
even though there will be some ozone impacts.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and make them stay there.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So it seems there are already fine particles

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that already have this effect.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
There are a lot of fun complexities

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And so you see a net force away from the sun.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's called the photophoretic force.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
have thought about how to exploit.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And of course, we may be wrong --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but so far, it seems good.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
much longer than before -- because they're levitated.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in principle solving the ozone problem.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I think it's almost certain we will

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
it's amazing how we can affect the planet.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to control the planet,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
with better knowledge of the way the system works

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and better engineering tools to effect it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And the box has two knobs.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We have no global governance.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And different people will have different places they want it set.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But we're building that box.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
The scientists and engineers of the world

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
are building it piece by piece, in their labs.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and it's better if we think hard about it,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
of my thinking about how to think about it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
We need a broader debate.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
who get engaged with this question about climate engineering

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and think seriously about what its implications are.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So here's one way to think about it,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And that calculation isn't much in dispute.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So because of this, we could deal with the problem

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
simply by stopping reducing emissions,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the amount of geo-engineering.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I don't think anybody takes that seriously.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
from the current climate.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But here's a case which is harder to reject.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
which is get serious about cutting emissions.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and eventually reduce concentrations.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and are rolling down the other side.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we've seen the worst of it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the oceans in the next 100 years,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That's an absolutely possible scenario.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And that's a very different way to look at the problem.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But there is a problem with that view.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And the problem is the following:

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the climate impacts look less fearsome,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
This is what economists call a moral hazard.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Should we do serious research on this topic?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Should we have a national research program that looks at this?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Not just at how you would do it better,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
A very small amount of money would get us some.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But I have a lot of reservations.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
A treaty that decides who gets to do this.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
than a non-geo-engineered world.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that will reduce emissions --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and weather control, whether we like it or not.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And it's time to begin thinking about it,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
for why we shouldn't do it.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Thank you very much.
