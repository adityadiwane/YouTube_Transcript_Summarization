00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
of about eight of my projects,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and we live and work in India.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I'd like to begin with my very first object,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
which I call "The Uncle Phone."

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
of constantly asking me to do things for him,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
almost like I were an extension of his body --

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
a pack of cigarettes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And I started to think of it as a form of control.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
But of course, I could never say anything,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
because the uncle is a respected figure

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
in the Indian family.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
was his use of a landline telephone.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I made him "The Uncle Phone."

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.260
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I started missing his commands.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And so I made him a golden typewriter

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
through which he could dispense his commands

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
type his email or command and pull the paper out.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
This device would automatically send the intended person

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the letter as an email.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that understands all of the mechanical actions

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and converts it to digital.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
the way my uncle likes it.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And we wanted to work with a notion of being

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So this is how it works.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
This is a video prototype.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And they don't react to background sounds.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
(Noise)

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
(Whistling)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So we worked very hard

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
to make them as lifelike as possible.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
mood swings, personalities and so on.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
So this is a very early prototype.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Of course, it got much better after that.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And we made them react to people,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And we were quite intrigued

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
with playing with the notion of invisibility.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So we worked with a company

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that specializes in camera surveillance,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
using a camera

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that could look at people in the room, track them

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
who's actually in the space.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
where the camera has made him invisible.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It's a very early video,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
but that got refined pretty soon, later.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and we had one monitor, one on each wall.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And as people walked into the room,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
one person was constantly invisible

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
wherever they moved in the room.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And it was almost like a sheet of paper,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
like a cutout of a childlike drawing

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of an oil spill or a sun.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
thinking it was some crap laying around.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
But as soon as they passed by,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
(Laughter)

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
So this work

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is a caricature of an upside-down man.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that it's sort of fallen into his hat,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Well what he does is he moves around

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
in a very drunken fashion on his head

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
it would start to wander about in the space.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And there's no wires.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
So I'll just show you an instance --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
so when people enter the room, it activates this object.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And it very slowly, over a few minutes,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
sort of painfully goes up,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and then it gains momentum

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and it looks like it's almost about to fall.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And this is an important moment,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
because we wanted to instill in the viewer

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
But it doesn't really need it,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
So this work was a real technical challenge for us,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And it was very important for us

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
to establish the exact moment that it would fall,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
then it would damage itself,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
or that sense of wanting to go and help it.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
So I'm going to show you a very quick video

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
That's my colleague. He's let it go.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
But he doesn't need to,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
because it manages to lift itself up on its own.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
working with the aesthetic of fur

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And it's at the scale of the night sky.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
which is in the shape of a teddy bear,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
which was hanging from the ceiling.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And the idea was to sort of contrast

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
into the familiar form of a teddy bear,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
which is very comforting and intimate.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And the idea was that at some point

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So this is the last work, and a work in progress,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and it's called "Space Filler."

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
standing in front of you in the middle of the room,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
by growing into a cube

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
to create a dynamic with people moving around it --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
almost like it were trying

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to conceal a secret within its seams or something.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So we work with a lot of technology,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
but we don't really love technology,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
But we use it because we're interested

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
in the way that it can help us

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
to express the emotions and behavioral patterns

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
in these creatures that we create.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And once a creature pops into our minds,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
it's almost like the process of creation

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Thank you.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
(Applause)
