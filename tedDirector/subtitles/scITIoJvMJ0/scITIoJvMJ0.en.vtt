00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
because I'm going to say some radical things,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
about how we should think about cancer differently,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
to an audience that contains a lot of people

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
who know a lot more about cancer than I do.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
(Laughter)

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And that this, in fact, will be

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
the way that we treat cancer in the future.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
In order to talk about cancer,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
I'm going to actually have to --

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
let me get the big slide here.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
of all the other things that are going on --

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
Having explained those,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
that will set up for what I think will be a different idea

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
about how to go about treating cancer.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
So let me start with genomics.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
It is the hot topic.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
It is the place where we're learning the most.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
This is the great frontier.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
But it has its limitations.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
that the genome is like the blueprint of your body,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
and if that were only true, it would be great,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
but it's not.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
It's like the parts list of your body.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
It doesn't say how things are connected,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
what causes what and so on.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
So if I can make an analogy,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
let's say that you were trying to tell the difference

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and a sick restaurant,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
and all you had was the list of ingredients

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
that they had in their larder.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
and you looked through it and you found

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
they only had margarine and they didn't have butter,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
you could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I can make them healthy."

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
And there probably are special cases of that.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
You could certainly tell the difference

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
by what they had in a larder.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
So the list of ingredients does tell you something,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
If they have tons of salt,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
But it's limited,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
you need the product of all of those ingredients.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
So if I look at a person

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
The part of the genome that we can read

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
is the list of ingredients.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And so indeed,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
there are times when we can find ingredients

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
that [are] bad.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
and we can actually make a direct correspondence

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
between the ingredient and the disease.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
they have the same genome.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
So the genome really tells you much more

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
about predisposition.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
So what you can tell

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
by looking at their ingredients list.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
between a healthy person and a sick person --

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
except in some of these special cases.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
So why all the big deal

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
about genetics?

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
Well first of all,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
It is very useful in certain circumstances.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
It's also the great theoretical triumph

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
of biology.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
It's the one theory

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
that the biologists ever really got right.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
It's fundamental to Darwin

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and Mendel and so on.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
So Mendel had this idea of a gene

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
as an abstract thing,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
and Darwin built a whole theory

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
that depended on them existing,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
and then Watson and Crick

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
actually looked and found one.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
So this happens in physics all the time.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
You predict a black hole,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
But it rarely happens in biology.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
So this great triumph -- it's so good,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
there's almost a religious experience

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
in biology.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And Darwinian evolution

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
is really the core theory.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
So the other reason it's been very popular

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
is because we can measure it, it's digital.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And in fact,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
thanks to Kary Mullis,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.330
you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
with a few extra ingredients.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
So for instance, by measuring the genome,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.330
we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
by the closeness of our genome,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
or how we're related to each other -- the family tree,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
or the tree of life.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
just by comparing the genetic similarity.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Now of course, in medical application,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
that is very useful

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
because it's the same kind of information

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
that the doctor gets from your family medical history --

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
except probably,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
And so by reading the genome,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
we can find out much more about your family than you probably know.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And so we can discover things

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
that probably you could have found

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
by looking at enough of your relatives,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
but they may be surprising.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
I did the 23andMe thing

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.330
(Laughter)

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
But mostly

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
what you need to know, to find out if you're sick,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
is not your predispositions,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
but it's actually what's going on in your body right now.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
So to do that, what you really need to do,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
you need to look at the things

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
that the genes are producing

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
and what's happening after the genetics,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and that's what proteomics is about.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
proteomics is the study of all the proteins.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
that are signaling between the cells --

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
actually, the machines that are operating --

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
that's where the action is.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
Basically, a human body

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
is a conversation going on,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
both within the cells and between the cells,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
and they're telling each other to grow and to die,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
and when you're sick,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
something's gone wrong with that conversation.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
And so the trick is --

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
like we can measure the genome.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
So the problem is that measuring --

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
It requires hundreds of steps,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
and it takes a long, long time.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
And it matters how much of the protein it is.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
of this very long stage,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
they pause for just a moment,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
and they leave something in an enzyme for a second,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
don't work.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And so then people get very inconsistent results

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
when they do it this way.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
People have tried very hard to do this.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
I tried this a couple of times

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and looked at this problem and gave up on it.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
I kept getting this call from this oncologist

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
named David Agus.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
from people who want help with their problems,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
so I kept on giving him to the delay list.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And then one day,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and Al Gore on the same day

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
saying return David Agus's phone call.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
(Laughter)

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful."

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
(Laughter)

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
So we started talking,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
and he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins."

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
Not going to be easy."

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
He's like, "No, no. I really need it.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
I mean, I see patients dying every day

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
because we don't know what's going on inside of them.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
We have to have a window into this."

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
And he took me through

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
specific examples of when he really needed it.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
if we could do it,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
and so I said, "Well, let's look at it."

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Applied Minds has enough play money

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
that we can go and just work on something

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
So we started playing around with this.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
that taking the sip of coffee --

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
that there were humans doing this complicated process

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
and that what really needed to be done

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
was to automate this process like an assembly line

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
and build robots

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
that would measure proteomics.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
And so we did that,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
and working with David,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
which makes this robotic assembly line,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Basically, what we do

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
is we take a drop of blood

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
out of a patient,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
and we sort out the proteins

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
in the drop of blood

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
according to how much they weigh,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
how slippery they are,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and we arrange them in an image.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And so we can look at literally

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
hundreds of thousands of features at once

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
out of that drop of blood.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
And we can take a different one tomorrow,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.330
they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.330
They really tell us what's going on there.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
And so this picture,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
which looks like a big smudge to you,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
and made me feel like we were on the right track.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
So if I zoom into that picture,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
I can just show you what it means.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
is the weight of the fragments that we're getting,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
and from top to bottom is how slippery they are.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
And so each of these lines

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
And you can see how the lines occur

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.330
in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
carbon comes in different isotopes,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
so if it has an extra neutron on it,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
we actually measure it as a different chemical.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
And so that gives you an idea

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
of how exquisitely sensitive this is.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
So seeing this picture

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
is sort of like getting to be Galileo

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
and looking at the stars

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
and looking through the telescope for the first time,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
But we can see that stuff out there

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
and actually see features of it.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
So what we do with this

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
is, for example, we can look at two patients,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
and ask, "What's going on differently

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
inside of them?"

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
And so we can make these measurements precisely enough

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
So here we have Alice in green

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
and Bob in red.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
We overlay them. This is actual data.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
but there's some things that just Alice has

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
and some things that just Bob has.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And if we find a pattern of things

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
of the responders to the drug,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
we see that in the blood,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
they have the condition

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
that allows them to respond to this drug.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
We might not even know what this protein is,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
but we can see it's a marker

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
for the response to the disease.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
So this already, I think,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
But I think this is actually

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
just the beginning

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
of how we're going to treat cancer.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
So let me move to cancer.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
The thing about cancer --

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
when I got into this,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
I really knew nothing about it,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
but working with David Agus,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
I started watching how cancer was actually being treated

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
and went to operations where it was being cut out.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And as I looked at it,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
to me it didn't make sense

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
how we were approaching cancer,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
and in order to make sense of it,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
I had to learn where did this come from.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.330
We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
We're treating it as something that got inside of you

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
that we have to kill.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
So this is the great paradigm.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
This is another case

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
was the germ theory of disease.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
So what doctors are mostly trained to do

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
is diagnose --

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
that is, put you into a category

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
and apply a scientifically proven treatment

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
for that diagnosis --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
and that works great for infectious diseases.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
So if we put you in the category

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
We know that that works.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
or some derivative of it.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
and it's miraculous

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
in the case of infectious disease --

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
how well it works.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
if doctors didn't do this.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
But now let's apply that

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
to systems diseases like cancer.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
The problem is that, in cancer,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
there isn't something else

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
that's inside of you.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
It's you; you're broken.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
That conversation inside of you

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
got mixed up in some way.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
So how do we diagnose that conversation?

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
you know, where did it appear? --

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and we put you in different categories

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
according to the part of the body.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And then we do a clinical trial

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
for a drug for lung cancer

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
and we treat these as if they're separate diseases

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
and that this way of dividing them

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
had something to do with what actually went wrong.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
with what went wrong

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
because cancer is a failure of the system.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
And in fact, I think we're even wrong

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
when we talk about cancer as a thing.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
I think this is the big mistake.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.330
I think cancer should not be a noun.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
We should talk about cancering

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
as something we do, not something we have.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
And so those tumors,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
those are symptoms of cancer.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
And so your body is probably cancering all the time,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
but there are lots of systems in your body

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
that keep it under control.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
And so to give you an idea

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
of an analogy of what I mean

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
by thinking of cancering as a verb,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
and the way that we talked about it,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
That's kind of the level at which it is.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
"Kitchen water,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
that helps.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
Whereas living room water,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
it's better to do tar on the roof."

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
And it sounds silly,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
but that's basically what we do.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
but I'm saying that's not really the problem;

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
that's the symptom of the problem.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.330
What we really need to get at

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
is the process that's going on,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.330
and that's happening at the level

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
of the proteonomic actions,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
in the way that it normally does?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.330
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.330
but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
So what we need

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.330
is to have a causative model

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
of what's actually going on,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
and proteomics actually gives us

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.330
the ability to build a model like that.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
David got me invited

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
to give a talk at National Cancer Institute

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
and Anna Barker was there.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
And so I gave this talk

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
and said, "Why don't you guys do this?"

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
And Anna said,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
"Because nobody within cancer

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
would look at it this way.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
for people outside the field of cancer

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
to get together with doctors

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
who really know about cancer

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.330
and work out different programs of research."

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
So David and I applied to this program

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
and created a consortium

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.330
at USC

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
and some of the best biologists in the world,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
from Cold Spring Harbor,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
Stanford, Austin --

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.330
I won't even go through and name all the places --

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.330
to have a research project

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.330
that will last for five years

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.330
where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.330
We're doing it in mice first,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.330
and we will kill a lot of mice

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.330
in the process of doing this,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
but they will die for a good cause.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
And we will actually try to get to the point

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.330
where we have a predictive model

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.330
where we can understand,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
when cancer happens,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
what's actually happening in there

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.330
and which treatment will treat that cancer.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.330
So let me just end with giving you a little picture

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.330
of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
So I think eventually,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.330
once we have one of these models for people,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.330
which we'll get eventually --

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.330
I mean, our group won't get all the way there --

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
but eventually we'll have a very good computer model --

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.330
sort of like a global climate model for weather.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.330
It has lots of different information

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.330
about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.330
on many different scales.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.330
And so we will simulate

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.330
in that model

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.330
for your particular cancer --

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
and this also will be for ALS,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.330
or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.330
things like that --

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
we will simulate

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
specifically you,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.330
not just a generic person,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.330
but what's actually going on inside you.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
And in that simulation, what we could do

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.330
is design for you specifically

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330
a sequence of treatments,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.330
and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
It might be things like, don't eat that day,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.330
or give them a little chemotherapy,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
maybe a little radiation.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.330
Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.330
But design a program of treatments specifically for you

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
and help your body

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.330
guide back to health --

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
guide your body back to health.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.330
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.330
if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.330
We put it in the equivalent of splints.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.330
And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
for fixing cancer,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
and we just have to prop those up in the right way

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.330
and get them to do the job.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.330
And so I believe that this will be the way

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.330
that cancer will be treated in the future.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.330
It's going to require a lot of work,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.330
a lot of research.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330
There will be many teams like our team

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.330
that work on this.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.330
But I think eventually,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.330
we will design for everybody

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.330
a custom treatment for cancer.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
So thank you very much.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:49.330
(Applause)
