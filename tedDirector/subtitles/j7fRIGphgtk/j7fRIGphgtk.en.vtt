00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:14.698
When people think about cities,

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.000
they tend to think of certain things.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.060
They think of buildings and streets

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.956
and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.890
But when I think about cities,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.691
I think about people.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:29.161
Cities are fundamentally about people,

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.005
and where people go

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.520
and where people meet

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.850
are at the core of what makes a city work.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
So even more important than buildings in a city

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.038
are the public spaces in between them.

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:44.696
And today, some of the most transformative

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.373
changes in cities

00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:49.559
are happening in these public spaces.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.752
So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:56.872
are the key to planning a great city.

00:00:56.872 --> 00:01:00.292
They are what makes it come alive.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.972
But what makes a public space work?

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:07.523
What attracts people to successful public spaces,

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.945
and what is it about unsuccessful places

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.625
that keeps people away?

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.984
I thought, if I could answer those questions,

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:19.764
I could make a huge contribution to my city.

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:21.918
But one of the more wonky things about me

00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:25.469
is that I am an animal behaviorist,

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.046
and I use those skills not to study animal behavior

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.980
but to study how people in cities

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.228
use city public spaces.

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:37.549
One of the first spaces that I studied

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.954
was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:43.262
in midtown Manhattan.

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:47.387
This little space became a small phenomenon,

00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:50.255
and because it had such a profound impact

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:51.471
on New Yorkers,

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:55.555
it made an enormous impression on me.

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.052
I studied this park very early on in my career

00:01:58.052 --> 00:01:59.638
because it happened to have been built

00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:01.416
by my stepfather,

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:04.048
so I knew that places like Paley Park

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:06.448
didn't happen by accident.

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:09.000
I saw firsthand that they required

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.456
incredible dedication

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:13.514
and enormous attention to detail.

00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:15.248
But what was it about this space

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:19.050
that made it special and drew people to it?

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.951
Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,

00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.843
and first among other things

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.906
were the comfortable, movable chairs.

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:29.416
People would come in, find their own seat,

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:32.810
move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.658
and then interestingly,

00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:37.633
people themselves attracted other people,

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.410
and ironically, I felt more peaceful

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.391
if there were other people around.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.281
And it was green.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:48.042
This little park provided what New Yorkers crave:

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.580
comfort and greenery.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.268
But my question was,

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:55.330
why weren't there more places with greenery

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.839
and places to sit in the middle of the city

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.319
where you didn't feel alone,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.776
or like a trespasser?

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:05.008
Unfortunately, that's not how cities

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:07.026
were being designed.

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:10.720
So here you see a familiar sight.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.001
This is how plazas have been
designed for generations.

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:18.131
They have that stylish, Spartan look

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.951
that we often associate with modern architecture,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.262
but it's not surprising that people

00:03:24.262 --> 00:03:26.124
avoid spaces like this.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:28.234
They not only look desolate,

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:30.946
they feel downright dangerous.

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:34.223
I mean, where would you sit here?

00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:36.769
What would you do here?

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.245
But architects love them.

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:43.518
They are plinths for their creations.

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:45.451
They might tolerate a sculpture or two,

00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:47.204
but that's about it.

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:50.408
And for developers, they are ideal.

00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:52.995
There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:56.955
and no undesirable people to worry about.

00:03:56.955 --> 00:04:00.199
But don't you think this is a waste?

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.520
For me, becoming a city planner

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.192
meant being able to truly change the city

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.682
that I lived in and loved.

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:10.170
I wanted to be able to create places

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.135
that would give you the feeling that you got

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:13.673
in Paley Park,

00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:18.461
and not allow developers to
build bleak plazas like this.

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.876
But over the many years,

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:22.472
I have learned how hard it is

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:25.060
to create successful, meaningful,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.088
enjoyable public spaces.

00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:28.665
As I learned from my stepfather,

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:30.953
they certainly do not happen by accident,

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:33.781
especially in a city like New York,

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:37.060
where public space has to
be fought for to begin with,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.168
and then for them to be successful,

00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:41.190
somebody has to think very hard

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.214
about every detail.

00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:47.160
Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.964
Yes, they are opportunities
for commercial investment,

00:04:50.964 --> 00:04:54.533
but they are also opportunities for the common good

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:56.299
of the city,

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:59.814
and those two goals are often
not aligned with one another,

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:02.423
and therein lies the conflict.

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:05.075
The first opportunity I had to fight

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:08.237
for a great public open space was in the early 1980s,

00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:10.575
when I was leading a team of planners

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:13.887
at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City

00:05:13.887 --> 00:05:16.500
in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.314
And this sandy wasteland had lain barren

00:05:19.314 --> 00:05:20.764
for 10 years,

00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:23.408
and we were told, unless we found a developer

00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:25.536
in six months, it would go bankrupt.

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:27.537
So we came up with a radical,

00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:29.927
almost insane idea.

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.775
Instead of building a park

00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:34.283
as a complement to future development,

00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:36.368
why don't we reverse that equation

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:39.421
and build a small but very high-quality

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.406
public open space first,

00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:44.412
and see if that made a difference.

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:48.110
So we only could afford to build a two-block section

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.570
of what would become a mile-long esplanade,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.537
so whatever we built had to be perfect.

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:57.533
So just to make sure, I insisted

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.750
that we build a mock-up

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.684
in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:06.708
And when I sat down on that test bench

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:09.906
with sand still swirling all around me,

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:12.999
the railing hit exactly at eye level,

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.990
blocking my view and ruining my experience

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.120
at the water's edge.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.427
So you see, details really do make a difference.

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:25.358
But design is not just how something looks,

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:31.250
it's how your body feels on that seat in that space,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.390
and I believe that successful design always depends

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.815
on that very individual experience.

00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:42.186
In this photo, everything looks very finished,

00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:44.904
but that granite edge, those lights,

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.792
the back on that bench,

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.486
the trees in planting,

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:51.089
and the many different kinds of places to sit

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.271
were all little battles that turned this project

00:06:54.271 --> 00:06:58.315
into a place that people wanted to be.

00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:02.150
Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.158
when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:05.740
his planning commissioner

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.587
and put me in charge of shaping

00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:09.658
the entire city of New York.

00:07:09.658 --> 00:07:11.757
And he said to me on that very day,

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:13.853
he said that New York was projected

00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:16.910
to grow from eight to nine million people.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.440
And he asked me,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.283
"So where are you going to put

00:07:20.283 --> 00:07:22.999
one million additional New Yorkers?"

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:25.644
Well, I didn't have any idea.

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:28.683
Now, you know that New York does

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:31.381
place a high value on attracting immigrants,

00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:34.301
so we were excited about the prospect of growth,

00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:37.180
but honestly, where were we going to grow

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.574
in a city that was already built out to its edges

00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:43.374
and surrounded by water?

00:07:43.374 --> 00:07:44.976
How were we going to find housing

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:47.274
for that many new New Yorkers?

00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:49.087
And if we couldn't spread out,

00:07:49.087 --> 00:07:50.901
which was probably a good thing,

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.720
where could new housing go?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.353
And what about cars?

00:07:55.353 --> 00:07:59.465
Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.299
So what were we going to do?

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:06.276
If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:07.310
And if we had to go up,

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.092
we had to go up in places

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:11.101
where you wouldn't need to own a car.

00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:13.964
So that meant using one of our greatest assets:

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:16.416
our transit system.

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.989
But we had never before thought

00:08:17.989 --> 00:08:20.225
of how we could make the most of it.

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:23.438
So here was the answer to our puzzle.

00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:27.069
If we were to channel and redirect

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:29.363
all new development around transit,

00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:32.990
we could actually handle that population increase,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.264
we thought.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.822
And so here was the plan,

00:08:36.822 --> 00:08:38.470
what we really needed to do:

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.318
We needed to redo our zoning --

00:08:41.318 --> 00:08:44.669
and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:47.980
and basically reshape the entire city,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.125
targeting where new development could go

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:52.316
and prohibiting any development at all

00:08:52.316 --> 00:08:54.030
in our car-oriented,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.192
suburban-style neighborhoods.

00:08:56.192 --> 00:08:59.924
Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,

00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:02.500
ambitious because communities

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.115
had to approve those plans.

00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:09.134
So how was I going to get this done?

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.042
By listening. So I began listening,

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:15.396
in fact, thousands of hours of listening

00:09:15.396 --> 00:09:17.214
just to establish trust.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:19.303
You know, communities can tell

00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:21.455
whether or not you understand their neighborhoods.

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:24.551
It's not something you can just fake.

00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:27.257
And so I began walking.

00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:29.577
I can't tell you how many blocks I walked,

00:09:29.577 --> 00:09:32.986
in sweltering summers, in freezing winters,

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:34.816
year after year,

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:36.904
just so I could get to understand

00:09:36.904 --> 00:09:38.931
the DNA of each neighborhood

00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:41.506
and know what each street felt like.

00:09:41.506 --> 00:09:45.001
I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.070
finding ways that zoning could address

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.132
communities' concerns.

00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:51.704
So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,

00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:53.139
block by block,

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:55.012
we began to set height limits

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.744
so that all new development

00:09:56.744 --> 00:10:00.361
would be predictable and near transit.

00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.142
Over the course of 12 years,

00:10:02.142 --> 00:10:04.611
we were able to rezone

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:07.180
124 neighborhoods,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.959
40 percent of the city,

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:14.498
12,500 blocks, so that now,

00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:17.735
90 percent of all new development of New York

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:20.383
is within a 10-minute walk of a subway.

00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:23.033
In other words, nobody in those new buildings

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:24.909
needs to own a car.

00:10:24.909 --> 00:10:29.002
Well, those rezonings were exhausting

00:10:29.002 --> 00:10:32.040
and enervating and important,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.590
but rezoning was never my mission.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.081
You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.

00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:40.169
My mission was always to create

00:10:40.169 --> 00:10:42.093
great public spaces.

00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:45.985
So in the areas where we zoned
for significant development,

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:48.176
I was determined to create places

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:50.870
that would make a difference in people's lives.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.956
Here you see what was

00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:55.380
two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.147
in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:58.929
and Williamsburg in Brooklyn,

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:02.489
impossible to get to and impossible to use.

00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:04.983
Now the zoning here was massive,

00:11:04.983 --> 00:11:08.005
so I felt an obligation to create

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:11.030
magnificent parks on these waterfronts,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.770
and I spent an incredible amount of time

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.875
on every square inch of these plans.

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.940
I wanted to make sure that there were

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.479
tree-lined paths from the upland to the water,

00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:23.890
that there were trees and plantings everywhere,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.078
and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.448
Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:33.073
I had to have faith.

00:11:33.073 --> 00:11:36.036
But I put everything that I had studied and learned

00:11:36.036 --> 00:11:37.770
into those plans.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.430
And then it opened,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.717
and I have to tell you, it was incredible.

00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:44.802
People came from all over the city

00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:46.459
to be in these parks.

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:49.879
I know they changed the lives
of the people who live there,

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:52.374
but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image

00:11:52.374 --> 00:11:54.150
of their city.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.729
I often come down and watch people

00:11:55.729 --> 00:11:57.245
get on this little ferry

00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:59.223
that now runs between the boroughs,

00:11:59.223 --> 00:12:00.710
and I can't tell you why,

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.282
but I'm completely moved

00:12:02.282 --> 00:12:04.429
by the fact that people are using it

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:06.611
as if it had always been there.

00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.884
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan.

00:12:09.884 --> 00:12:12.641
Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan

00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.574
was a complete mess before 9/11.

00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:17.489
Wall Street was essentially landlocked

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:20.075
because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.

00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:23.909
And after 9/11, the city had very little control.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.454
But I thought if we went

00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:27.599
to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation

00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:30.560
and got money to reclaim this two miles

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.356
of degraded waterfront

00:12:32.356 --> 00:12:34.207
that it would have an enormous effect

00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:36.668
on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.

00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:37.848
And it did.

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:41.239
Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:43.353
on all three sides.

00:12:43.353 --> 00:12:45.737
I really love this park.

00:12:45.737 --> 00:12:47.962
You know, railings have to be higher now,

00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:50.506
so we put bar seating at the edge,

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:52.618
and you can get so close to the water

00:12:52.618 --> 00:12:54.346
you're practically on it.

00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:56.215
And see how the railing widens

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:57.631
and flattens out so you can lay down

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.513
your lunch or your laptop.

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:01.493
And I love when people come there

00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:03.353
and look up and they say,

00:13:03.353 --> 00:13:07.380
"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.732
So what's the trick?

00:13:09.732 --> 00:13:11.541
How do you turn a park

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:14.707
into a place that people want to be?

00:13:14.707 --> 00:13:17.550
Well, it's up to you,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.915
not as a city planner but as a human being.

00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:24.315
You don't tap into your design expertise.

00:13:24.315 --> 00:13:27.830
You tap into your humanity.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.156
I mean, would you want to go there?

00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:33.139
Would you want to stay there?

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:35.277
Can you see into it and out of it?

00:13:35.277 --> 00:13:37.529
Are there other people there?

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:40.176
Does it seem green and friendly?

00:13:40.176 --> 00:13:43.414
Can you find your very own seat?

00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:46.443
Well now, all over New York City,

00:13:46.443 --> 00:13:47.947
there are places where you can

00:13:47.947 --> 00:13:49.801
find your very own seat.

00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:52.323
Where there used to be parking spaces,

00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:54.616
there are now pop-up cafes.

00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.594
Where Broadway traffic used to run,

00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:58.558
there are now tables and chairs.

00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:02.112
Where 12 years ago, sidewalk
cafes were not allowed,

00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:04.085
they are now everywhere.

00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:07.080
But claiming these spaces for public use

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.219
was not simple,

00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:10.881
and it's even harder to keep them that way.

00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:12.570
So now I'm going to tell you a story

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.850
about a very unusual park called the High Line.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.904
The High Line was an elevated railway.

00:14:18.904 --> 00:14:25.535
(Applause)

00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:27.811
The High Line was an elevated railway

00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:29.623
that ran through three neighborhoods

00:14:29.623 --> 00:14:31.493
on Manhattan's West Side,

00:14:31.493 --> 00:14:33.238
and when the train stopped running,

00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:35.394
it became a self-seeded landscape,

00:14:35.394 --> 00:14:38.001
a kind of a garden in the sky.

00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:40.150
And when I saw it the first time,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.796
honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,

00:14:42.796 --> 00:14:45.612
I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,

00:14:45.612 --> 00:14:46.839
honestly.

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:48.960
And when I was appointed,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.036
saving the first two sections of the High Line

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:54.408
from demolition became my first priority

00:14:54.408 --> 00:14:57.080
and my most important project.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.348
I knew if there was a day that I didn't

00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:03.951
worry about the High Line, it would come down.

00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:05.940
And the High Line,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.400
even though it is widely known now

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.219
and phenomenally popular,

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:14.123
it is the most contested public space in the city.

00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:16.998
You might see a beautiful park,

00:15:16.998 --> 00:15:19.445
but not everyone does.

00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:22.082
You know, it's true, commercial interests

00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:25.299
will always battle against public space.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.123
You might say,

00:15:27.123 --> 00:15:28.693
"How wonderful it is that more than

00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:31.124
four million people come from all over the world

00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:32.771
to visit the High Line."

00:15:32.771 --> 00:15:37.387
Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers.

00:15:37.387 --> 00:15:40.112
Hey, why not take out those plantings

00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:42.120
and have shops all along the High Line?

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.617
Wouldn't that be terrific

00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:46.152
and won't it mean a lot more money for the city?

00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:48.644
Well no, it would not be terrific.

00:15:48.644 --> 00:15:51.943
It would be a mall, and not a park.

00:15:51.943 --> 00:15:59.322
(Applause)

00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:00.830
And you know what, it might mean

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.040
more money for the city,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.089
but a city has to take the long view,

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:10.025
the view for the common good.

00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:13.740
Most recently, the last section of the High Line,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.356
the third section of the High Line,

00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:16.926
the final section of the High Line,

00:16:16.926 --> 00:16:19.728
has been pitted against development interests,

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:22.028
where some of the city's leading developers

00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:24.710
are building more than 17 million square feet

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.010
at the Hudson Yards.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.971
And they came to me and proposed

00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:31.530
that they "temporarily disassemble"

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.260
that third and final section.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.723
Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in

00:16:36.723 --> 00:16:39.610
with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.073
on a hill.

00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:43.797
Perhaps it was just in their way.

00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:46.285
But in any case, it took nine months

00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.759
of nonstop daily negotiation

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.772
to finally get the signed agreement

00:16:50.772 --> 00:16:52.796
to prohibit its demolition,

00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:56.605
and that was only two years ago.

00:16:56.605 --> 00:16:59.063
So you see, no matter how popular

00:16:59.063 --> 00:17:01.899
and successful a public space may be,

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:04.315
it can never be taken for granted.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.896
Public spaces always -- this is it saved --

00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:10.608
public spaces always need vigilant champions,

00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:14.308
not only to claim them at the outset for public use,

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:17.839
but to design them for the people that use them,

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.870
then to maintain them to ensure

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.840
that they are for everyone,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.253
that they are not violated, invaded,

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:26.890
abandoned or ignored.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.534
If there is any one lesson

00:17:28.534 --> 00:17:31.686
that I have learned in my life as a city planner,

00:17:31.686 --> 00:17:35.446
it is that public spaces have power.

00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:38.515
It's not just the number of people using them,

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.469
it's the even greater number of people

00:17:40.469 --> 00:17:42.588
who feel better about their city

00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:45.820
just knowing that they are there.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.292
Public space can change how you live in a city,

00:17:49.292 --> 00:17:51.462
how you feel about a city,

00:17:51.462 --> 00:17:54.750
whether you choose one city over another,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.521
and public space is one of
the most important reasons

00:17:57.521 --> 00:18:00.642
why you stay in a city.

00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:03.107
I believe that a successful city

00:18:03.107 --> 00:18:05.728
is like a fabulous party.

00:18:05.728 --> 00:18:09.633
People stay because they are having a great time.

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:11.576
Thank you.

00:18:11.576 --> 00:18:17.529
(Applause)

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:22.159
Thank you. (Applause)
