00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:21.487
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:24.673
but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,

00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:26.495
so that was a bad idea. (Laughter)

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.916
Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:33.853
to present to you some of my music and some of my work

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:36.947
as a composer, presumably because it appeals

00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:40.930
to my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.538
And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.994
say that and move forward. (Laughter)

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:49.874
So, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.079
and that is that I'm really bored with music,

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.145
and I'm really bored with the role of the composer,

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:58.353
and so I decided to put that idea, boredom,

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.327
as the focus of my presentation to you today.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.615
And I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:05.850
that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.259
tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.813
for creativity and invention, and how boredom

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.974
actually forced me to change the fundamental question

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.055
that I was asking in my discipline,

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:19.114
and how boredom also, in a sense,

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:23.558
pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:26.168
most traditional, narrow definition of a composer.

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:28.639
What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.467
of a piece of music at the piano.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:40.782
(Music)

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:44.096
Okay, I wrote that. (Laughter)

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.003
No, it's not — (Applause) Oh, why thank you.

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:47.634
No, no, I didn't write that.

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:49.906
In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:52.461
and so I was not functioning as a composer.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.512
Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:57.573
and there I am, interpreter.

00:01:57.573 --> 00:02:00.282
So, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?

00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:04.489
But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.269
And I say this rhetorically, because of course

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:09.090
by just about any standard we would have to concede

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.038
that this is, of course, a piece of music,

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:13.364
but I put this here now because,

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:15.647
just to set it in your brains for the moment,

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:17.488
because we're going to return to this question.

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.270
It's going to be a kind of a refrain

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.081
as we go through the presentation.

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:23.309
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.515
and my problem with it is, it's boring.

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:33.335
I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like -- (Laughter)

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:35.053
It's Beethoven, how can you say that?

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:36.788
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:39.819
I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So -- (Laughter)

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.542
I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:45.186
to transform it in some ways, to personalize it,

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.613
so I might take the opening, like this idea --

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:49.821
(Music)

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:54.718
and then I might substitute -- (Music)

00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:56.357
and then I might improvise on that melody

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:59.992
that goes forward from there -- (Music)

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:26.014
(Music)

00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:29.126
So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.721
(Applause)

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.839
That would be the kind of thing that I would do,

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.936
and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:40.668
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is -- (Laughter) --

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:45.967
it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:49.137
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have

00:03:49.137 --> 00:03:52.709
to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.911
as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.116
and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations

00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:59.714
I'm going to make to it.

00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:02.289
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.947
I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.268
and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree

00:04:09.268 --> 00:04:12.959
that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.373
But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:17.793
for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,

00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:20.444
I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:23.662
it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:26.183
pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.793
and if you're not doing things like listening to it

00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:31.516
after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:33.485
It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:35.645
I go through other instruments, they become familiar,

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:38.322
and eventually I find myself designing and constructing

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:42.485
my own instrument, and I brought one with me today,

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:45.421
and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:47.627
so you can hear what it sounds like.

00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:59.040
(Music)

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.803
You gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:07.911
I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:11.067
They're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)

00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:20.126
(Music)

00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:22.711
I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:25.209
with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:33.062
So we have this sound. (Music)

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:35.106
And with a bank of live electronics,

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:39.227
I can change the sounds radically. (Music)

00:05:39.227 --> 00:05:48.301
(Music)

00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:54.552
Like that, and like this. (Music)

00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:56.670
And so forth.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.809
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.486
of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:05.260
and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about —

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.379
This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.643
and the cool thing about it is

00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:14.211
I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)

00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.830
Okay? (Applause)

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.006
So in that regard, this is one of the things,

00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:20.866
this is one of the privileges of being,

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:23.872
and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,

00:06:23.872 --> 00:06:26.050
when I told you that I'm the world's greatest,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.054
if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism

00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:32.058
and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.658
I know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)

00:06:35.658 --> 00:06:41.205
Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:43.937
I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.187
and it was this distinction that I was most worried about

00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:49.124
when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.

00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:51.610
I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.567
I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.

00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:58.383
Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises

00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:02.118
are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them

00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.470
to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.497
and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so

00:07:08.497 --> 00:07:11.015
I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.

00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:14.101
I get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:17.410
sometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.089
and this is probably the capacity, the role creatively

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:24.251
for which I'm probably best known professionally.

00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:27.226
Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this,

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:29.299
and others look like this,

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:31.383
and some look like this,

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:34.429
and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:36.762
It takes a long, long time to make these scores,

00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:38.935
and right now I'm working on a piece

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:40.958
that's 180 pages in length,

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.154
and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.663
I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)

00:07:47.663 --> 00:07:51.227
So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,

00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:54.200
so after a while the process of notating is not only boring,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.332
but I actually want the notation to be more interesting,

00:07:57.332 --> 00:08:00.051
and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.

00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.281
This is an excerpt from a score called

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.472
"The Metaphysics of Notation."

00:08:04.472 --> 00:08:07.016
The full score is 72 feet wide.

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:09.714
It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.

00:08:09.714 --> 00:08:12.600
Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.417
it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:20.034
with straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,

00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:22.688
and the 72 feet was actually split

00:08:22.688 --> 00:08:25.723
into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed

00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:30.607
around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:34.415
and it appeared for one year in the museum,

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:37.273
and during that year, it was experienced as visual art

00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:39.174
most of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,

00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:42.212
on Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,

00:08:42.212 --> 00:08:45.592
various performers came and interpreted these strange

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:48.871
and undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)

00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:52.555
Now this was a really exciting experience for me.

00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:54.158
It was gratifying musically, but I think

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.854
the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on

00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:59.750
another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.026
and that is as visual artist. (Laughter)

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:05.526
We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:07.529
I am multitudes. (Laughter)

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:10.433
So one of the things is that, I mean, some people

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.220
would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante,"

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.797
and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,

00:09:14.797 --> 00:09:16.956
because I don't have a pedigree in visual art

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.992
and I don't have any training, but it's just something

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:21.459
that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:24.359
as an extension of a kind of creative impulse.

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:27.455
I can understand the question, though. "But is it music?"

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:29.714
I mean, there's not any traditional notation.

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:31.967
I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:35.339
in this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.326
I took the Copenhagen subway map and

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:40.458
I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:43.229
and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,

00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:46.090
follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.151
So this is a case of actually adapting something,

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:51.034
or maybe stealing something,

00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:53.375
and then turning it into a musical notation.

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:55.530
Another adaptation would be this piece.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.876
I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:02.114
I made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:04.352
and the players follow these scores.

00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:06.373
They follow the second hands, and as they pass over

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:09.359
the various symbols, the players respond musically.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.582
Here's another example from another piece,

00:10:11.582 --> 00:10:13.636
and then its realization.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:16.115
So in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.502
in the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,

00:10:18.502 --> 00:10:21.020
or thief maybe, and I've also been designer,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.335
in the case of making the wristwatches.

00:10:23.335 --> 00:10:26.915
And once again, this is, for me, interesting.

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:30.234
Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.

00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:32.921
Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,

00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:35.075
and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip

00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:36.839
from a piece called "Echolalia."

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:39.910
This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.215
who is an extraordinary performer.

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:44.647
Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.

00:10:44.647 --> 00:11:13.535
(Music)

00:11:13.535 --> 00:11:15.219
Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because

00:11:15.219 --> 00:11:17.513
you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,

00:11:17.513 --> 00:11:19.641
the intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)

00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:21.653
Let's watch just another clip.

00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:32.229
(Music)

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.925
You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,

00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:36.803
there were no clarinets and trumpets

00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:38.707
and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has

00:11:38.707 --> 00:11:41.262
an even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.

00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:44.839
This is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)

00:11:57.587 --> 00:11:59.527
This was based on the experience of actually watching

00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:02.043
two people having a virulent argument in sign language,

00:12:02.043 --> 00:12:03.902
which produced no decibels to speak of,

00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:07.313
but affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.

00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:10.981
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances

00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:15.083
and then the total absence of conventional instruments

00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:17.956
and this glut of conductors, people might, you know,

00:12:17.956 --> 00:12:20.859
wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"

00:12:20.859 --> 00:12:24.706
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,

00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:27.193
and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.191
You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments

00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:32.891
in this clip. (Music)

00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:45.738
(Music)

00:12:45.738 --> 00:12:47.778
This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.

00:12:47.778 --> 00:12:50.333
I was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:54.618
I put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.

00:12:54.618 --> 00:12:56.644
Let's continue with that same excerpt.

00:12:56.644 --> 00:13:06.937
(Music)

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:15.027
It's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:17.263
Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:31.239
(Music)

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:34.287
So with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,

00:13:34.287 --> 00:13:37.110
and that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.597
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?

00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:44.060
Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right?

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.993
There was the florist, and I can understand that,

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:49.133
once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music

00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:51.846
as we know it conventionally,

00:13:51.846 --> 00:13:56.269
but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.934
This is going to be a piece called "Aphasia,"

00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:02.369
and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,

00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:05.108
and this invites yet another role, and final one

00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:07.681
I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.159
And the score for the piece looks like this,

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.569
and it instructs me, the performer, to make

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:17.299
various hand gestures at very specific times

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:19.553
synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape

00:14:19.553 --> 00:14:22.430
is made up exclusively of vocal samples.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.852
I recorded an awesome singer,

00:14:24.852 --> 00:14:27.197
and I took the sound of his voice in my computer,

00:14:27.197 --> 00:14:29.796
and I warped it in countless ways to come up with

00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:32.064
the soundtrack that you're about to hear.

00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:37.029
And I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay?

00:14:37.029 --> 00:15:15.365
(Music)

00:15:15.368 --> 00:15:21.991
So that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)

00:15:21.991 --> 00:15:24.275
Yeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.

00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:26.514
Is it music? Here's how I want to conclude.

00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:29.090
I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.048
that this is not the important question.

00:15:31.048 --> 00:15:33.781
The important question is, "Is it interesting?"

00:15:33.781 --> 00:15:36.673
And I follow this question, not worrying about "Is it music?" --

00:15:36.673 --> 00:15:39.159
not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:41.612
I allow my creativity to push me

00:15:41.612 --> 00:15:43.772
in directions that are simply interesting to me,

00:15:43.772 --> 00:15:46.821
and I don't worry about the likeness of the result

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.877
to some notion, some paradigm,

00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:51.866
of what music composition is supposed to be,

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:54.309
and that has actually urged me, in a sense,

00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:56.044
to take on a whole bunch of different roles,

00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:58.179
and so what I want you to think about is,

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:01.397
to what extent might you change the fundamental question

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:04.120
in your discipline, and, okay,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.500
I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.114
because, like, I realized I mentioned

00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:11.049
some psychological defects earlier, and we also,

00:16:11.049 --> 00:16:14.792
along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,

00:16:14.792 --> 00:16:16.953
and there was some delusional behavior and things like that,

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.934
and here I think we could say that this is an argument

00:16:19.934 --> 00:16:21.913
for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,

00:16:21.913 --> 00:16:23.849
at least in the popular use of the term,

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:26.083
and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:29.146
Anyway, despite those perils, I would urge you

00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:31.721
to think about the possibility that you might take on roles

00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:33.812
in your own work, whether they are neighboring

00:16:33.812 --> 00:16:36.310
or far-flung from your professional definition.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.087
And with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)

00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:44.286
(Applause)
