00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Early visions of wireless power

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
basically about 100 years ago.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
The thought that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
no one ever thought of that.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And so, in fact, he actually set about

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
doing a variety of things.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
anywhere on Earth.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
took it down for security purposes,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
sometime in the early 1900s.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
But the one thing that did come out of electricity

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
is that we love this stuff so much.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
I mean, think about how much we love this.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
that have been invested in infrastructure around the world,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
putting up wires to get power from where it's created

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
to where it's used.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
The other thing is, we love batteries.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
there is something like 40 billion

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
disposable batteries built every year

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
for power that, generally speaking,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
is used within a few inches or a few feet

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
of where there is very inexpensive power.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So, before I got here,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
I thought, "You know, I am from North America.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
So I thought I'd better look it up first.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
So definition number six is the North American

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
definition of the word "suck."

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
Wires suck, they really do.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
or something under your desk.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
The other thing is, batteries suck too.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And they really, really do.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
40 billion of these things built.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
This is what happens.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
They fall apart, they disintegrate,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
and they end up here.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So when you talk about expensive power,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
the cost per kilowatt-hour

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
to supply battery power to something

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Think about that.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
The most expensive grid power in the world

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
is thousandths of that.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
So fortunately, one of the other definitions

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
of "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And nature really does abhor a vacuum.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
What happened back a few years ago

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
at a distance of about two meters.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
by the way, that's still a couple thousand times

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
But were able to light that,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and do it very successfully.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
This was actually the experiment. So you can see

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
the coils were somewhat larger.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
This all came from a professor

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
waking up at night to the third night in a row

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
that his wife's cellphone was beeping

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
because it was running out of battery power.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And he actually came up with this concept

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
of resonant energy transfer.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.160
and actually do transfer power

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
was separate the coils in a transformer

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.160
to a greater distance than the size of those transformers

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
using this technology, which is not dissimilar

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It's a resonant phenomenon

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
which is nicknamed the Genius Award,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
last September, for his discovery.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
So how does it work?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
there's a capacitor attached to it too.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And if you can cause that coil to resonate,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
what will happen is it will pulse

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
at alternating current frequencies --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
at a fairly high frequency, by the way.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And if you can bring another device

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
close enough to the source,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
that will only work at exactly that frequency,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
and transfer magnetic energy between them.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
turn it back into electricity,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
and then you can use it.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Number one question I get asked.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
You know. What about safety?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
The first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
It doesn't radiate.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
It stays within either what we call the source,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
or within the device.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
We live in a magnetic field.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.160
And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
that will regulate everything we do.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
They've pretty much set field exposure limits,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
sort of sit underneath those guidelines.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Mobile electronics.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Home electronics.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
has something that looks like that or those batteries.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
There are industrial applications.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And then finally, electric vehicles.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
These electric cars are beautiful.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
But who is going to want to plug them in?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this --

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.160
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
where people don't have to die of infections anymore

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
if you can seal the thing up.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
and show you, actually, how it works.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
You've got a coil.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
We put one on the back of the television set.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
There's lots of electronics and secret sauce

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
It will cause one to get created

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
on the other side.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And if the demo gods are willing,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
in about 10 seconds or so we should see it.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
The 10 seconds actually are because we --

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
when you use just a cord.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Generally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
we put a little computer in it that has to wake up

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
to tell it to do that.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
So, I'll plug that in.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
It creates a magnetic field here.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
It causes one to be created out here.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
we should start to see ...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
This is a commercially --

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.160
(Applause)

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
available color television set.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Imagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
How many people want to hang them on the wall?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Imagine if you can get rid of it.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Almost immediately, though, people ask,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
was his wife's cellphone beeping.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
So, I wanted to show you something.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
This a Google G1.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
It runs the Android operating system.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
It's odd. It has a battery.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
It also has coiled electronics

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
that WiTricity has put into the back of it.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
And if I can get the camera --

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
okay, great --

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.160
you'll see, as I get sort of close...

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.160
(Applause)

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
So we put a little sleeve on the back,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.160
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.160
(Applause)

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
And Nokia as well.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
But they typically use it to light up the screen.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
They could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
So that when you walk in or you come in from home,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
And think of what that would do for you.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
So I think in closing,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
I thought I'd put up one more slide.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
And for those of you who can't read it, it says,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So, thank you very much.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160
(Applause)
