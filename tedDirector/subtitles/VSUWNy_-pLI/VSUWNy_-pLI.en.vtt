00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:15.256
Tell your daughters of this year,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.376
how we woke needing coffee

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.216
but discovered instead cadavers
strewn about our morning papers,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.040
waterlogged facsimiles
of our sisters, spouses, small children.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.216
Say to your baby of this year
when she asks, as she certainly should,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.816
tell her it was too late coming.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.296
Admit even in the year we leased freedom,
we didn't own it outright.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.136
There were still laws
for every way we used our privates

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.656
while they pawed at the soft folds of us,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.415
grabbed with no concern for consent,

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.056
no laws made for the men
that enforced them.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.496
We were trained to dodge,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.136
to wait, to cower and cover,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.056
to wait more, still, wait.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.960
We were told to be silent.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.696
But speak to your girls of this wartime,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.296
a year preceded by a score of the same,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.576
so as in two decades before,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.136
we wiped our eyes,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.056
laced caskets with flags,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.256
evacuated the crime scene of the club,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.576
caterwauled in the street,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.896
laid our bodies on the concrete
against the outlines of our fallen,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.855
cried, "Of course we mattered,"

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.256
chanted for our disappeared.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.880
The women wept this year.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.656
They did.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.136
In the same year, we were ready.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.256
The year we lost our inhibition
and moved with courageous abandon

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.776
was also the year we stared down barrels,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.136
sang of cranes in skies,
ducked and parried,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.616
caught gold in hijab,
collected death threats,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.976
knew ourselves as patriots,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.216
said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down
and found a running mate,"

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.376
made road maps for infant joy,
shamed nothing but fear,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.656
called ourselves fat and meant, of course,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.896
impeccable.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.856
This year, we were women,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.656
not brides or trinkets,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.176
not an off-brand gender,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.336
not a concession, but women.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.656
Instruct your babies.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.056
Remind them that the year has passed
to be docile or small.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.696
Some of us said for the first time
that we were women,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.096
took this oath of solidarity seriously.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.376
Some of us bore children
and some of us did not,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.816
and none of us questioned
whether that made us real

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.616
or appropriate or true.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.776
When she asks you of this year,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.705
your daughter, whether your offspring
or heir to your triumph,

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.736
from her comforted side of history
teetering towards woman,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.056
she will wonder and ask voraciously,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.015
though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.816
she will hold your estimation of it holy,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.336
curiously probing, "Where were you?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.376
Did you fight?
Were you fearful or fearsome?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.256
What colored the walls of your regret?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.936
What did you do for women
in the year it was time?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.856
This path you made for me,
which bones had to break?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.136
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.376
And are you a hero?"

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.816
She will ask the difficult questions.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.016
She will not care
about the arc of your brow,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.296
the weight of your clutch.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.976
She will not ask of your mentions.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.376
Your daughter, for whom you have
already carried so much, wants to know

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.896
what you brought, what gift,
what light did you keep from extinction?

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.856
When they came for victims in the night,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.976
did you sleep through it
or were you roused?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.656
What was the cost of staying woke?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.146
What, in the year we said time's up,
what did you do with your privilege?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.696
Did you sup on others' squalor?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.856
Did you look away
or directly into the flame?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.416
Did you know your skill
or treat it like a liability?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.776
Were you fooled by the epithets
of "nasty" or "less than"?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.296
Did you teach with an open heart
or a clenched fist?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.536
Where were you?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.416
Tell her the truth. Make it your life.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.416
Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.656
with the moment
drawn on my face like a dagger,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.016
and flung it back at itself,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.456
slicing space for you."

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.296
Tell her the truth, how you lived
in spite of crooked odds.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.576
Tell her you were brave,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.936
and always, always
in the company of courage,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.256
mostly the days
when you just had yourself.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.256
Tell her she was born as you were,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.896
as your mothers before,
and the sisters beside them,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.016
in the age of legends, like always.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.736
Tell her she was born just in time,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.040
just in time

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.736
to lead.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.096
(Applause)
