00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.616
In the year 1901,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.120
a woman called Auguste was taken
to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.496
Auguste was delusional

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.520
and couldn't remember
even the most basic details of her life.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Her doctor was called Alois.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.096
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.640
but he watched over her until,
sadly, she passed away in 1906.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.256
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.496
and found strange plaques
and tangles in Auguste's brain --

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.856
the likes of which he'd never seen before.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.040
Now here's the even more striking thing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.960
If Auguste had instead been alive today,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.280
we could offer her no more help
than Alois was able to 114 years ago.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.640
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.656
And Auguste Deter

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.920
was the first patient to be diagnosed with
what we now call Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.136
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
to protect us from infections,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.016
many treatments for cancer,
antiretrovirals for HIV,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.520
statins for heart disease and much more.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:29.761
But we've made essentially no progress
at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.976
I'm part of a team of scientists

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.286
who has been working to find
a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.256
So I think about this all the time.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.880
Alzheimer's now affects
40 million people worldwide.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.560
But by 2050, it will affect
150 million people --

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.520
which, by the way,
will include many of you.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
If you're hoping
to live to be 85 or older,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.840
your chance of getting Alzheimer's
will be almost one in two.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.816
In other words, odds are
you'll spend your golden years

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.056
either suffering from Alzheimer's

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400
or helping to look after a friend
or loved one with Alzheimer's.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.456
Already in the United States alone,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.759
Alzheimer's care costs
200 billion dollars every year.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.920
One out of every five
Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.816
It is today the most expensive disease,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.056
and costs are projected
to increase fivefold by 2050,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.240
as the baby boomer generation ages.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.376
It may surprise you that, put simply,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.960
Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
and social challenges of our generation.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.040
But we've done relatively
little to address it.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.480
Today, of the top 10
causes of death worldwide,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.520
Alzheimer's is the only one
we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.160
We understand less about the science
of Alzheimer's than other diseases

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.600
because we've invested less time
and money into researching it.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.376
The US government
spends 10 times more every year

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.376
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.440
despite the fact
that Alzheimer's costs us more

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.720
and causes a similar number
of deaths each year as cancer.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.616
The lack of resources
stems from a more fundamental cause:

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.000
a lack of awareness.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.000
Because here's what few people know
but everyone should:

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.640
Alzheimer's is a disease,
and we can cure it.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.856
For most of the past 114 years,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.336
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
confused Alzheimer's with aging.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.837
We thought that becoming senile

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.100
was a normal and inevitable
part of getting old.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.016
But we only have to look at a picture

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.896
of a healthy aged brain compared
to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.960
to see the real physical damage
caused by this disease.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.816
As well as triggering severe loss
of memory and mental abilities,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.056
the damage to the brain
caused by Alzheimer's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.840
significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.536
Remember Dr. Alzheimer
found strange plaques and tangles

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560
in Auguste's brain a century ago.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.280
For almost a century,
we didn't know much about these.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.920
Today we know they're made
from protein molecules.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.296
You can imagine a protein molecule

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.360
as a piece of paper that normally folds
into an elaborate piece of origami.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.256
There are spots
on the paper that are sticky.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.536
And when it folds correctly,
these sticky bits end up on the inside.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.016
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.056
This causes the protein molecules
to stick to each other,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.760
forming clumps that eventually become
large plaques and tangles.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.400
That's what we see
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.336
We've spent the past 10 years
at the University of Cambridge

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.080
trying to understand
how this malfunction works.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.496
There are many steps, and identifying
which step to try to block is complex --

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800
like defusing a bomb.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.696
Cutting one wire might do nothing.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.320
Cutting others might
make the bomb explore.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.336
We have to find the right step to block,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.480
and then create a drug that does it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.056
Until recently, we for the most part

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.536
have been cutting wires
and hoping for the best.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.416
But now we've got together
a diverse group of people --

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.016
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
physicists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.256
And together, we've managed
to identify a critical step in the process

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.496
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.040
and stop the disease.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.856
Now let me show you
some of our latest results.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.536
No one outside of our lab
has seen these yet.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.536
Let's look at some videos of what happened
when we tested these new drugs in worms.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.416
So these are healthy worms,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.640
and you can see
they're moving around normally.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.000
These worms, on the other hand,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.576
have protein molecules
sticking together inside them --

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.216
like humans with Alzheimer's.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.536
And you can see they're clearly sick.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.536
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.240
then we see that they're healthy,
and they live a normal lifespan.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.856
This is just an initial positive result,
but research like this

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.616
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
that we can understand and we can cure.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.536
After 114 years of waiting,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.936
there's finally real hope
for what can be achieved

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.680
in the next 10 or 20 years.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.360
But to grow that hope,
to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.776
This isn't about scientists like me --

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.000
it's about you.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.176
We need you to raise awareness
that Alzheimer's is a disease

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.816
and that if we try, we can beat it.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.656
In the case of other diseases,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.816
patients and their families
have led the charge for more research

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.776
and put pressure on governments,
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.016
scientists and regulators.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.896
That was essential for advancing treatment
for HIV in the late 1980s.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600
Today, we see that same drive
to beat cancer.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.656
But Alzheimer's patients are often
unable to speak up for themselves.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.416
And their families, the hidden victims,
caring for their loved ones night and day,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.480
are often too worn out
to go out and advocate for change.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400
So, it really is down to you.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.056
Alzheimer's isn't,
for the most part, a genetic disease.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.200
Everyone with a brain is at risk.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.656
Today, there are 40 million
patients like Auguste,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.576
who can't create the change
they need for themselves.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.160
Help speak up for them,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.280
and help demand a cure.

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:48.496
Thank you.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.120
(Applause)
