00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.970
My dream is to build the world's first

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.294
underground park in New York City.

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:19.841
Now, why would someone want
to build an underground park,

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.038
and why in New York City?

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:24.562
These three tough little buggers

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.778
are, on the left, my grandmother, age five,

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.128
and then her sister and brother,

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.666
ages 11 and nine.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.863
This photo was taken just before they left

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:35.471
from Italy to immigrate to the United States,

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.982
just about a century ago.

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:39.377
And like many immigrants at the time,

00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:41.090
they arrived on the Lower East Side

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.291
in New York City

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.160
and they encountered a crazy melting pot.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.567
What was amazing about their generation

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.627
was that they were not only building new lives

00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:51.750
in this new, unfamiliar area,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.346
but they were also literally building the city.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.479
I've always been fascinated by those decades

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.799
and by that history,

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.278
and I would often beg my grandmother

00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:01.947
to tell me as many stories as possible

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:03.955
about the old New York.

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:06.133
But she would often just shrug it off,

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.383
tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:10.260
and so I very rarely got

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.355
any of the history that I wanted to hear about.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.616
The New York City that I encountered

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.514
felt pretty built up.

00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:18.711
I always knew as a kid that I wanted

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.229
to make a difference, and to somehow

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.435
make the world more beautiful, more interesting

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:23.462
and more just.

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:25.259
I just didn't really know how.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.947
At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:29.366
so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.481
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:35.115
local Kenyan politics than the
politics of my own hometown.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.121
I took a job with the City of New York,

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.270
but very quickly felt frustrated

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.308
with the slowness of government bureaucracy.

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:44.013
I even took a job at Google,

00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:47.110
where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.856
and believed almost wholeheartedly

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:52.474
that technology could solve all social problems.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:55.960
But I still didn't feel like I was
making the world a better place.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.819
It was in 2009 that my friend

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.787
and now business partner James Ramsey

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:02.881
alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.331
which is this.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.166
This is the former trolley terminal

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.744
that was the depot for passengers

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.648
traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:12.932
from Brooklyn to Manhattan,

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.701
and it was open between 1908 and 1948,

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:18.143
just around the time when my grandparents were

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.992
living right in the area.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:21.640
And we learned also that the site

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.882
was entirely abandoned in 1948.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.805
Fascinated by this discovery,

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:29.933
we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.440
and we finally got a tour,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.590
and this is what we saw.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.300
Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.960
It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.119
feeling that you have when you get in this space.

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.807
It's a football field of unused land

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:47.210
immediately below a very crowded area of the city,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.345
and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:51.060
on an archaeological dig,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.833
and all the details are all still there.

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.801
It's really pretty remarkable.

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:57.401
Now, the site itself is located at the very heart

00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.270
of the Lower East Side,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.766
and today it still remains one of the most

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.757
crowded neighborhoods in the city.

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:04.557
New York City has two thirds the green space

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:06.605
per resident as other big cities,

00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.778
and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:11.601
So we immediately started thinking about how we

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.671
could take this site and turn it into something

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:15.058
that could be used for the public,

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:17.810
but also could potentially even be green.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.140
Our plan, in a nutshell,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.841
is to draw natural sunlight underground

00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:24.944
using a simple system that
harvests sunlight above the street,

00:03:24.944 --> 00:03:27.380
directs it below the city sidewalks,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.310
and would allow plants and trees to grow

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.999
with the light that's directed underneath.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.730
With this approach, you could take a site

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.941
that looks like this today

00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:37.707
and transform it into something

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:39.673
that looks like this.

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:43.704
In 2011, we first released some of these images,

00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:45.093
and what was funny was,

00:03:45.093 --> 00:03:47.417
a lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.353
like the High Line underground."

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:53.673
And so what our nickname ended up becoming,

00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:55.473
and what ended up sticking,

00:03:55.473 --> 00:03:58.319
was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.996
What was also clear was that people really wanted

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:01.694
to know a lot more about how the technology

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:03.260
would look and feel,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.393
and that there was really much more interest in this

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.488
than we had ever thought possible.

00:04:07.488 --> 00:04:09.727
So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job

00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:11.921
and focus entirely on this project.

00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:13.743
Here is us with our team

00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:16.151
putting together a technology demonstration

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.170
in a warehouse.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.270
Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.599
which we built to show the technology.

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.479
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.090
And here's the full exhibit all put together

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.541
in this warehouse.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.318
You can see the solar canopy overhead,

00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:33.734
the light streaming in,

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:36.358
and this entirely live green space below.

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:37.784
So in the course of just a few weeks,

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:41.353
tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,

00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:42.810
and since that time, we've grown

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.111
our numbers of supporters both locally

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.823
and among design enthusiasts all over the world.

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:49.884
Here's a rendering of the neighborhood

00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:52.250
just immediately above the Line's site,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.384
and a rendering of how it will look

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:56.668
after major redevelopment that is coming

00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.671
over the course of the next 10 years.

00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:00.786
Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:02.710
and how there's really a lack of green space.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.430
So what we're proposing is really something that will

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.180
add one football field of green space

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.046
underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:14.760
will introduce a really community-driven focus

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.943
in a rapidly gentrifying area.

00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:18.687
And right now, we're focusing very closely

00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:21.106
on how we engage with the City of New York

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:24.549
on really transforming the overall ecosystem

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.630
in an integrated way.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.239
Here's our rendering of how we would actually

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:30.377
invite people into the space itself.

00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:32.683
So here you see this iconic entrance

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:34.855
in which we would literally peel up the street

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:37.870
and reveal the historical layers of the city,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.775
and invite people into this warm underground space.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.034
In the middle of winter, when it's
absolutely freezing outside,

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.124
the last place you'd want to go would be

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:46.634
an outdoor space or outdoor park.

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:48.559
The Lowline would really be a four-season space

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.045
and a respite for the city.

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:53.363
So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings

00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:55.984
my own family's story full circle.

00:05:55.984 --> 00:05:57.918
If my grandparents and my parents were really

00:05:57.918 --> 00:06:01.205
focused on building the city up and out,

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:03.281
I think my generation is focused on reclaiming

00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:05.189
the spaces that we already have,

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.146
rediscovering our shared history,

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:09.724
and reimagining how we can make our communities

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:12.737
more interesting, more beautiful and more just.

00:06:12.737 --> 00:06:14.706
Thanks.

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.437
(Applause)
