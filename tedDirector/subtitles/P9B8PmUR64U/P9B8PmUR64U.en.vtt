00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.018
When we're designing new products,

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:17.032
services or businesses,

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:19.574
the only time you'll know
if they're any good,

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:21.296
if the designs are good,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.055
is to see how they're used
in the real world, in context.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.695
I'm reminded of that every time
I walk past Highbury Fields

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.159
in north London.

00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:33.501
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.222
There's a big open green space.

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:37.814
There's Georgian buildings
around the side.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:40.736
But then there's this mud trap
that cuts across the middle.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.844
People clearly don't want to walk
all the way around the edge.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:47.332
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:49.812
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:54.162
Now, this shortcut
is called a desire path,

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.686
and it's often the path
of least resistance.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.043
I find them fascinating,

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:03.532
because they're often the point
where design and user experience diverge.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.017
Now at this point, I should apologize,

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.913
because you guys are going to start
seeing these everywhere.

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.599
But today, I'm going to pick
three I find interesting

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:13.734
and share what actually it reminds me

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.566
about launching new products and services.

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:20.800
The first is in the capital city
of Brazil -- Brasilia.

00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:23.341
And it reminds me that sometimes,

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:26.493
you have to just focus
on designing for a real need

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:27.786
at low friction.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:29.764
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:32.930
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.162
It was the golden age of flying,

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:38.450
so he laid it out like a plane,
as you can see there.

00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:39.639
Slightly worryingly,

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:43.411
he put most of the important
government buildings in the cockpit.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.882
But if you zoom in,
in the very center of Brasilia,

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.068
just where the point is there,

00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:50.492
you see it's littered with desire paths.

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:53.046
They're absolutely everywhere.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940
Now, they thought that they
had future-proofed this design.

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.979
They thought in the future
we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:00.551
we'd be able to drive --

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.532
so there was little need
for walkways or pavements.

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.691
But as you can see, there's a real need.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:09.386
These are very dangerous desire paths.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.447
If we just pick one, in the middle,

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.878
you can see it crosses
15 lanes of traffic.

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:16.658
It won't surprise you guys

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:20.222
that Brasilia has five times
the pedestrian accident rate

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.124
of your average US city.

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.455
People are resourceful.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.513
They'll always find the low-friction route

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.932
to save money, save time.

00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:32.476
Not all these desire paths are dangerous,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.893
I was reminded flying here
when I was in Heathrow.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:38.437
Many of us get frustrated
when we're confronted

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.130
with the obligatory walk
through duty-free.

00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:44.175
It was amazing to me

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.334
how many people refused to take
the long, meandering path to the left,

00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:50.435
and just cut through to the right,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.180
cut through the desire path.

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:54.521
The question that's interesting is:

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:57.735
What do designers think
when they see our behavior here?

00:02:58.198 --> 00:02:59.989
Do they think we're stupid?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.809
Do they think we're lazy?

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:04.957
Or do they accept
that this is the only truth?

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:06.739
This is their product.

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:09.667
We're effectively
co-designing their product.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.466
So our job is to design
for real needs at low friction,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.386
because if you don't,
the customer will, anyway.

00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:21.458
The second desire path I wanted to share

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:23.734
is at the University of California.

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:24.910
And it reminds me

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:28.092
that sometimes the best way
to come up with a great design

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:29.800
is just to launch it.

00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:34.738
Now, university campuses are fantastic
for spotting desire paths.

00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:38.100
I think it's because students
are always late and they're pretty smart.

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.606
So they're dashing to lectures.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.723
They'll always find the shortcut.

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.506
And the designers here knew that.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.503
So they built the buildings

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.441
and then they waited a few months
for the paths to form.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.354
They then paved them.

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:52.417
(Laughter)

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.346
Incredibly smart approach.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.842
In fact, often, just launching
the straw man of a service

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.007
can teach you what people really want.

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:04.861
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston
knew he wanted to open a restaurant.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:06.293
But where should it be?

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:08.236
What should the menu be?

00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:10.150
He launched a service,

00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:11.860
in this case a food truck,

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.259
and he changed the location each day.

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:17.827
He'd write a different menu
on the side in a whiteboard marker

00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:19.763
to figure out what people wanted.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.637
He now has a chain of restaurants.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.692
So it can be incredibly efficient

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:27.481
to launch something
to spot the desire paths.

00:04:28.232 --> 00:04:31.314
The third and final desire path
I wanted to share with you

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.961
is the UNIH.

00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:35.883
It reminds me that the world's in flux,

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:38.207
and we have to respond to those changes.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.837
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.

00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:44.378
I've marked for you on the left
the Oncology Department.

00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:49.083
The patients would usually stay
in the hotels down on the bottom right.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.243
This was a patient-centered organization,

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:54.895
so they laid on cars for their patients.

00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.263
But what they realized when they started
offering chemotherapy

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:02.064
is the patients rarely
wanted to get in cars.

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:05.990
They were too nauseous,
so they'd walk back to their hotels.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.953
This desire path that you see
diagonally, formed.

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:12.133
The patients even called it
"The Chemo Trail."

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.999
Now, when the hospital
saw this originally,

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.917
they tried to lay turf
back over it, ignore it.

00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:21.860
But after a while, they realized
it was an important need

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:23.661
they were meeting for their patients,

00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:24.993
so they paved it.

00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:28.866
And I think our job is often
to pave these emerging desire paths.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.016
If we look back at the one
in North London again,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.410
that desire path hasn't always been there.

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:36.372
The reason it sprung up

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:40.494
is people were traveling to the mighty
Arsenal Football Club stadium

00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:41.669
on game days,

00:05:41.693 --> 00:05:44.470
from the Underground station
you see on the bottom right.

00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:46.104
So you see the desire path.

00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:48.942
If we just wind the clock
back a few years,

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:51.163
when the stadium was being constructed,

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:52.746
there is no desire path.

00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:57.943
So our job is to watch
for these desire paths emerging,

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.331
and, where appropriate, pave them,

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:02.530
as someone did here.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:04.839
Someone installed a barrier,

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:09.296
people started walking across
and round the bottom as you see,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.518
and they paved it.

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:12.122
(Laughter)

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:14.534
But I think this is a wonderful
reminder as well,

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.410
that, actually, the world is in flux.

00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:17.656
It's constantly changing,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.912
because if you look
at the top of this image,

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:21.928
there's another desire path forming.

00:06:23.413 --> 00:06:25.943
So these three desire paths remind me

00:06:25.967 --> 00:06:29.114
we need to design for real human needs.

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:32.062
I think empathy for what
your customers want

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:35.820
is probably the biggest leading indicator
of business success.

00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:37.989
Design for real needs

00:06:38.013 --> 00:06:40.417
and design them in low friction,

00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:43.790
because if you don't offer them
in low friction,

00:06:43.814 --> 00:06:46.409
someone else will, often the customer.

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:51.035
Secondly, often the best way
to learn what people really want

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.923
is to launch your service.

00:06:52.947 --> 00:06:55.727
The answer is rarely inside the building.

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.224
Get out there and see
what people really want.

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:01.149
And finally, in part
because of technology,

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:03.986
the world is incredibly flux
at the moment.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.969
It's changing constantly.

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:09.238
These desire paths are going
to spring up faster than ever.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.677
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones

00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:13.946
and pave over them.

00:07:14.572 --> 00:07:15.723
Thank you very much.

00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:19.712
(Applause)
