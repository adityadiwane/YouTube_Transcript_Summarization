00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:18.507
Traditional prescriptions for growth
in Africa are not working very well.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.971
After one trillion dollars
in African development-related aid

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.099
in the last 60 years,

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.847
real per capita income today
is lower than it was in the 1970s.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.170
Aid is not doing too well.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.588
In response,

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:38.672
the Bretton Woods institutions --
the IMF and the World Bank --

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.226
pushed for free trade not aid,

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:46.451
yet the historical record
shows little empirical evidence

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.561
that free trade leads to economic growth.

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:54.460
The newly prescribed 
silver bullet is microcredit.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.177
We seem to be fixated
on this romanticized idea

00:00:58.177 --> 00:01:02.031
that every poor peasant in Africa
is an entrepreneur.

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:04.098
(Laughter)

00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:10.698
Yet my work and travel
in 40-plus countries across Africa

00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:15.615
have taught me that most people
want jobs instead.

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.750
My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.836
Let's invest in building
pan-African titans

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:27.061
like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:32.959
Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when
he founded Celtel International in '98

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.494
and built it into a mobile 
cellular provider

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:42.901
with 24 million subscribers
across 14 African countries by 2004.

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:47.745
The Mo model might be better
than the everyman entrepreneur model,

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:51.741
which prevents an effective means
of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.357
Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:59.624
where many actors and small enterprises
leads to growth through competition.

00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:03.034
Consider these two alternative scenarios.

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:09.070
One: You loan 200 dollars 
to each of 500 banana farmers

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.967
allowing them to dry 
their surplus bananas

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:16.295
and fetch 15 percent more revenue
at the local market.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:22.477
Or two: You give 100,000 dollars
to one savvy entrepreneur

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:27.695
and help her set up a factory
that yields 40 percent additional income

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:32.792
to all 500 banana farmers
and creates 50 additional jobs.

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:36.371
We invested in the second scenario,

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:40.867
and backed 26-year-old
Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.536
to set up an agro-processing
factory called Stawi

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:49.420
to produce gluten-free
banana-based flour and baby food.

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.283
Stawi is leveraging economies of scale

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:58.164
and using modern manufacturing processes
to create value for not only its owners

00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:01.499
but its workers, who have
an ownership in the business.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.708
Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi
and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:13.855
which requires skill, financing,
local and global partnerships,

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:16.525
and extraordinary perseverance.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.610
But why pan-African?

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.188
The scramble for Africa
during the Berlin Conference of 1884 --

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:28.924
where, quite frankly, we Africans
were not exactly consulted --

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:34.332
(Laughter) (Applause) --

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:38.003
resulted in massive fragmentation

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:40.534
and many sovereign states
with small populations:

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:43.576
Liberia, four million;
Cape Verde, 500,000.

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:46.315
Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,

00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:50.472
granted across 55 countries
with trade barriers and other impediments,

00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:53.705
but our ancestors traded
across the continent

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:56.282
before Europeans drew lines around us.

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:59.719
The pan-African opportunities
outweigh the challenges,

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.155
and that's why we're expanding
Stawi's markets from just Kenya

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:07.520
to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,
and anywhere else that will buy our food.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.514
We hope to help solve food security,
empower farmers, create jobs,

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:15.948
develop the local economy,
and we hope to become rich in the process.

00:04:15.948 --> 00:04:18.167
While it's not the sexiest approach,

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.415
and maybe it doesn't
achieve the same feel-good

00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:24.306
as giving a woman 100 dollars 
to buy a goat on kiva.org,

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:28.231
perhaps supporting fewer,
higher-impact entrepreneurs

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:31.204
to build massive businesses
that scale pan-Africa

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.364
can help change this.

00:04:34.364 --> 00:04:38.918
The political freedom
for which our forebearers fought

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:42.636
is meaningless without economic freedom.

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.136
We hope to aid this fight
for economic freedom

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:48.597
by building world-class businesses,

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:50.571
creating indigenous wealth,

00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:53.705
providing jobs that we
so desperately need,

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:56.902
and hopefully helping achieve this.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.694
Africa shall rise.

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:02.250
Thank you.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.008
(Applause)

00:05:09.471 --> 00:05:13.465
Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course,
this is strong rhetoric.

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:16.460
You're making 100 percent contrast
between microcredit

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.825
and regular investment
and growing regular investment.

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:23.277
Do you think there is
a role for microcredit at all?

00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:25.539
Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.093
Microcredit has been a great,
innovative way

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:32.063
to expand financial access
to the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:32.063 --> 00:05:34.315
But for the problems we face in Africa,

00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:36.204
when we are looking
at the Marshall Plan

00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:37.821
to revitalize war-torn Europe,

00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:39.904
it was not full of donations of sheep.

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.626
We need more than just microcredit.

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.757
We need more than just give 200 dollars.

00:05:43.757 --> 00:05:46.831
We need to build big businesses,
and we need jobs.

00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:49.227
TR: Very good. Thank you so much.

00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.892
(Applause)
