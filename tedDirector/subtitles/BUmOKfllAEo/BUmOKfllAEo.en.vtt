00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.330
Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.330
dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.330
up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
is to try to allow each of you to experience

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.330
the thrill of revealing nature's design.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.330
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
The challenge of looking at nature's designs --

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
The challenge, of course, is to answer this question:

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
what permits this extraordinary performance of animals

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
that allows them basically to go anywhere?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.330
And if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
organisms have millions of years to get it right;

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
We know from working on animals that the truth is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.330
are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.330
that you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.330
then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it --

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
(Laughter)

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
So, organisms have this important history.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
You need to discover the general principles of nature,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
This is a real challenge to do this, because animals,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
when you start to really look inside them -- how they work --

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
of the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
They have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Even the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.330
How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed --

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.330
and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
is if the control of their movements

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.330
tended to be built into their bodies themselves.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.330
What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
all produce the same forces on the ground when they move.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.330
or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
or four legs as one of a trotting crab.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And then they alternate in their propulsion,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
-- you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.330
like T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
Now, what's interesting is the animals, then -- we said -- bounce along

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
the vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
in "A Bug's Life," we discussed the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
bipedal nature of the characters of the ants.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
when you're telling us these animals are moving

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.330
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.330
we collapsed them down as one.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
We got some of the best mathematicians in the world

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
from Princeton to work on this problem.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
And we were able to create a model

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
where animals are not only bouncing up and down,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
Now, why is this important to have this model?

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
and you perturb it, you give it a push,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.330
as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.330
It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
(Laughter)

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.330
That's enough!

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.330
(Laughter)

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
The animals, when you look at them running,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
appear to be self-stabilizing like this,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
using basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
computations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
are embedded in the form of the animal itself.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
natural technologies, at least they have been so far.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.330
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
Human technologies have tended to be large, flat,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.330
with right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
and axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Whereas nature tends to be small, and curved,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
and it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
and has many muscles and many, many sensors.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.330
So it's a very different design. However, what's changing,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
what's really exciting -- and I'll show you some of that next --

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.330
of nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
And here's one example that's really exciting.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.330
And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
that they like, and put in the material properties.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.330
For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
It just bends by itself beautifully.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
So, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.330
this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
Our work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
from the University of Michigan and McGill

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:58.330
named RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Let's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
and then some of the simple robots

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
that have been inspired by our discoveries.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
not on a treadmill.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Here's what we do.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
(Laughter)

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.330
This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.330
you think you don't have in your kitchen.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:30.330
This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks --

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
in this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
It goes up to four meters per second when it runs.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.330
when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.330
like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.330
the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
Now, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
to have greater stability and maneuverability.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.330
of the animals that we're looking at.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.330
that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:39.330
you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
Shape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:50.330
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
It moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is

00:09:53.330 --> 00:10:00.330
going on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
compared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.330
it can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:15.330
over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
It's this technique of building the properties into the form.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project --

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
very robust, if a graduate student

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
does that to his thesis project.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.330
(Laughter)

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
making its first outing in a demo.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.330
(Laughter)

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.330
Same principle: it only has six moving parts,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:49.330
six motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.330
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.330
and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:07.330
(Laughter)

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.330
(Voice: Oh my God.)

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.330
(Applause)

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand --

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.330
although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
Here's RHex entering the woods.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
(Laughter)

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:48.330
it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:58.330
with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:06.330
(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.330
that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.330
and life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said --

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
especially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.330
Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
we should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
just to give them the sense of being on Mars.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.330
(Laughter)

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:41.330
(Applause)

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
and can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.330
that we studied to look at this, is the gecko.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:03.330
We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
One of the animals is going to be running on the level,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.330
They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
is running up the wall?

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
(Applause)

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:43.330
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
and then peel off the surface, like tape.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
Like if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:03.330
They do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:13.330
Here's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:28.330
in real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
You can't use regular cameras.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
You have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out --

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.330
come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.330
(Laughter)

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
through the treadmill belt, to see how they move.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.330
Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Pick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:23.330
It can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.330
First we'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
It uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko --

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.330
that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
transition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:54.330
There's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
The animal does not use that.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
But that's what we're limited to, at the moment.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.330
What does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.330
And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
that's there's little striations in these leaves.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:19.330
And if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.330
you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:33.330
those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
you'll see each hair has split ends.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.330
And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.330
The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:50.330
and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.330
to get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair --

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:01.330
a gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Think of the contact of that that's possible.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
We were fortunate to work with another group

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.330
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
When we measured the forces, they were enormous.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size --

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.330
the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.330
about 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.330
We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
No, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
No, you can change the charge -- they still hold on.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.330
No, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don't do it.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.330
How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.330
How about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.330
They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.330
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.330
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.330
by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.330
You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
where you had these two atoms, they're close together,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.330
to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.330
with these small structures.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:22.330
What we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.330
and with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.330
And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.330
we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:40.330
dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
(Laughter)

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.330
We also presented to Nike even.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.330
(Laughter)

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:54.330
(Applause)

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.330
that we realized that that small-size scale --

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.330
and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore --

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.330
we needed to look at ants and their feet, because

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:11.330
one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.330
robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.330
But the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.330
we'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:25.330
to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
Where's this going? I think you can see it already.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.330
Clearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.330
you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.330
You're going to be able to do programmable

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.330
work through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:51.330
fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.330
So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.330
If you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.330
search and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.330
or the various things we're working on, we must preserve

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.330
nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.330
Thank you.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:17.330
(Applause)
