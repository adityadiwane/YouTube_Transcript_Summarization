00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.651
Chris Anderson: You were something
of a mathematical phenom.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.739
You had already taught at Harvard
and MIT at a young age.

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:20.953
And then the NSA came calling.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:22.668
What was that about?

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:27.130
Jim Simons: Well the NSA --
that's the National Security Agency --

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:29.123
they didn't exactly come calling.

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.939
They had an operation at Princeton,
where they hired mathematicians

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:36.905
to attack secret codes
and stuff like that.

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.966
And I knew that existed.

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:41.495
And they had a very good policy,

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.369
because you could do half your time
at your own mathematics,

00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:48.877
and at least half your time
working on their stuff.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.033
And they paid a lot.

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:54.108
So that was an irresistible pull.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:56.044
So, I went there.

00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:57.406
CA: You were a code-cracker.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.596
JS: I was.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.777
CA: Until you got fired.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.384
JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:02.653
CA: How come?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.613
JS: Well, how come?

00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.567
I got fired because,
well, the Vietnam War was on,

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:16.329
and the boss of bosses in my organization
was a big fan of the war

00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:20.748
and wrote a New York Times article,
a magazine section cover story,

00:01:20.772 --> 00:01:22.542
about how we would win in Vietnam.

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.695
And I didn't like that war,
I thought it was stupid.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.384
And I wrote a letter to the Times,
which they published,

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:32.422
saying not everyone
who works for Maxwell Taylor,

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:37.132
if anyone remembers that name,
agrees with his views.

00:01:37.553 --> 00:01:39.211
And I gave my own views ...

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.399
CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would --

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:43.978
JS: ... which were different
from General Taylor's.

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:45.908
But in the end, nobody said anything.

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:49.633
But then, I was 29 years old at this time,
and some kid came around

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:52.745
and said he was a stringer
from Newsweek magazine

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:58.136
and he wanted to interview me
and ask what I was doing about my views.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.059
And I told him, "I'm doing
mostly mathematics now,

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.456
and when the war is over,
then I'll do mostly their stuff."

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:08.948
Then I did the only
intelligent thing I'd done that day --

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:13.129
I told my local boss
that I gave that interview.

00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:14.612
And he said, "What'd you say?"

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:16.102
And I told him what I said.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.441
And then he said,
"I've got to call Taylor."

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:20.842
He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.128
I was fired five minutes after that.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.812
CA: OK.

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:25.987
JS: But it wasn't bad.

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.504
CA: It wasn't bad,
because you went on to Stony Brook

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:31.661
and stepped up your mathematical career.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.137
You started working with this man here.

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:35.325
Who is this?

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:37.764
JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:40.892
Chern was one of the great
mathematicians of the century.

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:46.149
I had known him when
I was a graduate student at Berkeley.

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:48.044
And I had some ideas,

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.515
and I brought them to him
and he liked them.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:57.165
Together, we did this work
which you can easily see up there.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.339
There it is.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:02.804
CA: It led to you publishing
a famous paper together.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:06.066
Can you explain at all what that work was?

00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:08.186
JS: No.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.484
(Laughter)

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.030
JS: I mean, I could
explain it to somebody.

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:15.129
(Laughter)

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.017
CA: How about explaining this?

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.770
JS: But not many. Not many people.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:23.958
CA: I think you told me
it had something to do with spheres,

00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:25.844
so let's start here.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:29.468
JS: Well, it did,
but I'll say about that work --

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:32.692
it did have something to do with that,
but before we get to that --

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:36.256
that work was good mathematics.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.772
I was very happy with it; so was Chern.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.086
It even started a little sub-field
that's now flourishing.

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:49.932
But, more interestingly,
it happened to apply to physics,

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:54.251
something we knew nothing about --
at least I knew nothing about physics,

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.557
and I don't think Chern
knew a heck of a lot.

00:03:56.581 --> 00:04:00.544
And about 10 years
after the paper came out,

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:05.048
a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton
started applying it to string theory

00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:09.924
and people in Russia started applying it
to what's called "condensed matter."

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:14.841
Today, those things in there
called Chern-Simons invariants

00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:16.730
have spread through a lot of physics.

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.928
And it was amazing.

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:19.317
We didn't know any physics.

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:22.568
It never occurred to me
that it would be applied to physics.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:26.380
But that's the thing about mathematics --
you never know where it's going to go.

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:27.896
CA: This is so incredible.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.284
So, we've been talking about
how evolution shapes human minds

00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:34.816
that may or may not perceive the truth.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.153
Somehow, you come up
with a mathematical theory,

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.025
not knowing any physics,

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.547
discover two decades later
that it's being applied

00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:45.602
to profoundly describe
the actual physical world.

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:46.779
How can that happen?

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:47.960
JS: God knows.

00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:50.094
(Laughter)

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.999
But there's a famous physicist
named [Eugene] Wigner,

00:04:54.023 --> 00:04:59.611
and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:03.587
Somehow, this mathematics,
which is rooted in the real world

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:08.606
in some sense -- we learn to count,
measure, everyone would do that --

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.460
and then it flourishes on its own.

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:13.817
But so often it comes
back to save the day.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.471
General relativity is an example.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.612
[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry,
and Einstein realized,

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:23.483
"Hey! It's the very thing
in which I can cast general relativity."

00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:26.619
So, you never know. It is a mystery.

00:05:27.056 --> 00:05:28.273
It is a mystery.

00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:31.593
CA: So, here's a mathematical
piece of ingenuity.

00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:32.959
Tell us about this.

00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:38.907
JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere,
and it has a lattice around it --

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:40.504
you know, those squares.

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:47.603
What I'm going to show here was
originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,

00:05:47.627 --> 00:05:49.881
the great mathematician, in the 1700s.

00:05:50.223 --> 00:05:55.404
And it gradually grew to be
a very important field in mathematics:

00:05:55.428 --> 00:05:57.762
algebraic topology, geometry.

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.403
That paper up there had its roots in this.

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:05.261
So, here's this thing:

00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:09.737
it has eight vertices,
12 edges, six faces.

00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:13.591
And if you look at the difference --
vertices minus edges plus faces --

00:06:13.615 --> 00:06:14.767
you get two.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.010
OK, well, two. That's a good number.

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:21.282
Here's a different way of doing it --
these are triangles covering --

00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:25.883
this has 12 vertices and 30 edges

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:30.102
and 20 faces, 20 tiles.

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:35.167
And vertices minus edges
plus faces still equals two.

00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:38.038
And in fact, you could do this
any which way --

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:41.460
cover this thing with all kinds
of polygons and triangles

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.804
and mix them up.

00:06:42.828 --> 00:06:46.107
And you take vertices minus edges
plus faces -- you'll get two.

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:47.742
Here's a different shape.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.730
This is a torus, or the surface
of a doughnut: 16 vertices

00:06:53.754 --> 00:06:57.998
covered by these rectangles,
32 edges, 16 faces.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.214
Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.

00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:02.713
It'll always come out to zero.

00:07:02.737 --> 00:07:07.047
Every time you cover a torus
with squares or triangles

00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:11.006
or anything like that,
you're going to get zero.

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:14.904
So, this is called
the Euler characteristic.

00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:18.377
And it's what's called
a topological invariant.

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:20.005
It's pretty amazing.

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:22.820
No matter how you do it,
you're always get the same answer.

00:07:22.844 --> 00:07:29.143
So that was the first sort of thrust,
from the mid-1700s,

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:32.936
into a subject which is now called
algebraic topology.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.943
CA: And your own work
took an idea like this and moved it

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:38.416
into higher-dimensional theory,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.528
higher-dimensional objects,
and found new invariances?

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:46.195
JS: Yes. Well, there were already
higher-dimensional invariants:

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:50.676
Pontryagin classes --
actually, there were Chern classes.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.248
There were a bunch
of these types of invariants.

00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:58.407
I was struggling to work on one of them

00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:02.634
and model it sort of combinatorially,

00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:05.680
instead of the way it was typically done,

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:10.063
and that led to this work
and we uncovered some new things.

00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:13.588
But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --

00:08:13.612 --> 00:08:17.593
who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics

00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:19.348
and had 13 children,

00:08:19.372 --> 00:08:25.814
who he apparently would dandle on his knee
while he was writing --

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:31.612
if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't
perhaps be these invariants.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:36.254
CA: OK, so that's at least given us
a flavor of that amazing mind in there.

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:38.347
Let's talk about Renaissance.

00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:44.227
Because you took that amazing mind
and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,

00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:47.480
you started to become a code-cracker
in the financial industry.

00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:50.194
I think you probably didn't buy
efficient market theory.

00:08:50.218 --> 00:08:56.605
Somehow you found a way of creating
astonishing returns over two decades.

00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:58.300
The way it's been explained to me,

00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:01.823
what's remarkable about what you did
wasn't just the size of the returns,

00:09:01.847 --> 00:09:05.730
it's that you took them
with surprisingly low volatility and risk,

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.578
compared with other hedge funds.

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.531
So how on earth did you do this, Jim?

00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:14.182
JS: I did it by assembling
a wonderful group of people.

00:09:14.206 --> 00:09:18.162
When I started doing trading, I had
gotten a little tired of mathematics.

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:22.109
I was in my late 30s,
I had a little money.

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:24.642
I started trading and it went very well.

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:27.811
I made quite a lot of money
with pure luck.

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:29.501
I mean, I think it was pure luck.

00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:31.634
It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.

00:09:31.658 --> 00:09:35.489
But in looking at the data,
after a while I realized:

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:38.066
it looks like there's some structure here.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.787
And I hired a few mathematicians,
and we started making some models --

00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:46.076
just the kind of thing we did back
at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.933
You design an algorithm,
you test it out on a computer.

00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:51.123
Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.

00:09:51.443 --> 00:09:52.922
CA: Can we take a look at this?

00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:57.487
Because here's a typical graph
of some commodity.

00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:02.528
I look at that, and I say,
"That's just a random, up-and-down walk --

00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:05.414
maybe a slight upward trend
over that whole period of time."

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.551
How on earth could you trade
looking at that,

00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:09.901
and see something that wasn't just random?

00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:13.172
JS: In the old days -- this is
kind of a graph from the old days,

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:17.480
commodities or currencies
had a tendency to trend.

00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:23.559
Not necessarily the very light trend
you see here, but trending in periods.

00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:27.639
And if you decided, OK,
I'm going to predict today,

00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:32.631
by the average move in the past 20 days --

00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:35.762
maybe that would be a good prediction,
and I'd make some money.

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:41.394
And in fact, years ago,
such a system would work --

00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:43.809
not beautifully, but it would work.

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.342
You'd make money, you'd lose
money, you'd make money.

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:48.564
But this is a year's worth of days,

00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:52.829
and you'd make a little money
during that period.

00:10:53.884 --> 00:10:55.842
It's a very vestigial system.

00:10:56.525 --> 00:11:00.054
CA: So you would test
a bunch of lengths of trends in time

00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:02.514
and see whether, for example,

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:06.019
a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend
was predictive of what happened next.

00:11:06.043 --> 00:11:12.805
JS: Sure, you would try all those things
and see what worked best.

00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:16.865
Trend-following would
have been great in the '60s,

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:19.021
and it was sort of OK in the '70s.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.918
By the '80s, it wasn't.

00:11:20.942 --> 00:11:23.759
CA: Because everyone could see that.

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:26.565
So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:33.178
JS: We stayed ahead of the pack
by finding other approaches --

00:11:33.202 --> 00:11:35.943
shorter-term approaches to some extent.

00:11:37.107 --> 00:11:40.454
The real thing was to gather
a tremendous amount of data --

00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:44.056
and we had to get it by hand
in the early days.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.546
We went down to the Federal Reserve
and copied interest rate histories

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.835
and stuff like that,
because it didn't exist on computers.

00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:52.502
We got a lot of data.

00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:56.686
And very smart people -- that was the key.

00:11:57.463 --> 00:12:01.239
I didn't really know how to hire
people to do fundamental trading.

00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:04.698
I had hired a few -- some made money,
some didn't make money.

00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:06.602
I couldn't make a business out of that.

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:08.668
But I did know how to hire scientists,

00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:12.081
because I have some taste
in that department.

00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:13.943
So, that's what we did.

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:17.198
And gradually these models
got better and better,

00:12:17.222 --> 00:12:18.557
and better and better.

00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.795
CA: You're credited with doing
something remarkable at Renaissance,

00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:24.420
which is building this culture,
this group of people,

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:27.586
who weren't just hired guns
who could be lured away by money.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.522
Their motivation was doing
exciting mathematics and science.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.259
JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.

00:12:34.283 --> 00:12:37.863
But some of it was money.

00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.280
CA: They made a lot of money.

00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:41.841
JS: I can't say that no one came
because of the money.

00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:44.118
I think a lot of them
came because of the money.

00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:46.163
But they also came
because it would be fun.

00:12:46.187 --> 00:12:48.675
CA: What role did machine learning
play in all this?

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:51.763
JS: In a certain sense,
what we did was machine learning.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:59.170
You look at a lot of data, and you try
to simulate different predictive schemes,

00:12:59.194 --> 00:13:01.376
until you get better and better at it.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.167
It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself
the way we did things.

00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:07.500
But it worked.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.209
CA: So these different predictive schemes
can be really quite wild and unexpected.

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:14.147
I mean, you looked at everything, right?

00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:17.488
You looked at the weather,
length of dresses, political opinion.

00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:20.349
JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.

00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:22.430
CA: What sort of things?

00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:23.612
JS: Well, everything.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.900
Everything is grist for the mill --
except hem lengths.

00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:31.152
Weather, annual reports,

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:35.908
quarterly reports, historic data itself,
volumes, you name it.

00:13:35.932 --> 00:13:37.083
Whatever there is.

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:39.728
We take in terabytes of data a day.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:43.876
And store it away and massage it
and get it ready for analysis.

00:13:45.446 --> 00:13:46.828
You're looking for anomalies.

00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:49.805
You're looking for -- like you said,

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.281
the efficient market
hypothesis is not correct.

00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:55.772
CA: But any one anomaly
might be just a random thing.

00:13:55.796 --> 00:13:59.454
So, is the secret here to just look
at multiple strange anomalies,

00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:00.806
and see when they align?

00:14:01.238 --> 00:14:04.451
JS: Any one anomaly
might be a random thing;

00:14:04.475 --> 00:14:07.514
however, if you have enough data
you can tell that it's not.

00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:12.488
You can see an anomaly that's persistent
for a sufficiently long time --

00:14:12.512 --> 00:14:17.487
the probability of it being
random is not high.

00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:22.369
But these things fade after a while;
anomalies can get washed out.

00:14:22.393 --> 00:14:24.813
So you have to keep on top
of the business.

00:14:24.837 --> 00:14:27.509
CA: A lot of people look
at the hedge fund industry now

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:31.931
and are sort of ... shocked by it,

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:34.127
by how much wealth is created there,

00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:36.396
and how much talent is going into it.

00:14:37.523 --> 00:14:41.529
Do you have any worries
about that industry,

00:14:41.553 --> 00:14:43.967
and perhaps the financial
industry in general?

00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:46.695
Kind of being on a runaway train that's --

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.749
I don't know --
helping increase inequality?

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:54.604
How would you champion what's happening
in the hedge fund industry?

00:14:54.628 --> 00:14:57.236
JS: I think in the last
three or four years,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.363
hedge funds have not done especially well.

00:14:59.387 --> 00:15:00.787
We've done dandy,

00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:04.812
but the hedge fund industry as a whole
has not done so wonderfully.

00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:09.738
The stock market has been on a roll,
going up as everybody knows,

00:15:09.762 --> 00:15:13.207
and price-earnings ratios have grown.

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:16.294
So an awful lot of the wealth
that's been created in the last --

00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:19.668
let's say, five or six years --
has not been created by hedge funds.

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:23.679
People would ask me,
"What's a hedge fund?"

00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:25.963
And I'd say, "One and 20."

00:15:25.987 --> 00:15:29.553
Which means -- now it's two and 20 --

00:15:29.577 --> 00:15:32.930
it's two percent fixed fee
and 20 percent of profits.

00:15:32.954 --> 00:15:35.306
Hedge funds are all
different kinds of creatures.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.569
CA: Rumor has it you charge
slightly higher fees than that.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:42.420
JS: We charged the highest fees
in the world at one time.

00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:45.670
Five and 44, that's what we charge.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:47.092
CA: Five and 44.

00:15:47.116 --> 00:15:50.350
So five percent flat,
44 percent of upside.

00:15:50.374 --> 00:15:53.157
You still made your investors
spectacular amounts of money.

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:54.633
JS: We made good returns, yes.

00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:57.657
People got very mad:
"How can you charge such high fees?"

00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:59.308
I said, "OK, you can withdraw."

00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:02.150
But "How can I get more?"
was what people were --

00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:03.678
(Laughter)

00:16:03.702 --> 00:16:06.142
But at a certain point,
as I think I told you,

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:11.341
we bought out all the investors
because there's a capacity to the fund.

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:14.069
CA: But should we worry
about the hedge fund industry

00:16:14.093 --> 00:16:19.531
attracting too much of the world's
great mathematical and other talent

00:16:19.555 --> 00:16:22.793
to work on that, as opposed
to the many other problems in the world?

00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:24.746
JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.449
We hire astronomers and physicists
and things like that.

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:30.264
I don't think we should worry
about it too much.

00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:33.430
It's still a pretty small industry.

00:16:33.454 --> 00:16:39.451
And in fact, bringing science
into the investing world

00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:41.634
has improved that world.

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:45.728
It's reduced volatility.
It's increased liquidity.

00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:48.941
Spreads are narrower because
people are trading that kind of stuff.

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:54.041
So I'm not too worried about Einstein
going off and starting a hedge fund.

00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:58.642
CA: You're at a phase in your life now
where you're actually investing, though,

00:16:58.666 --> 00:17:02.400
at the other end of the supply chain --

00:17:02.424 --> 00:17:06.528
you're actually boosting
mathematics across America.

00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:08.417
This is your wife, Marilyn.

00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:13.197
You're working on
philanthropic issues together.

00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.384
Tell me about that.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:18.057
JS: Well, Marilyn started --

00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.528
there she is up there,
my beautiful wife --

00:17:21.552 --> 00:17:24.524
she started the foundation
about 20 years ago.

00:17:24.548 --> 00:17:25.699
I think '94.

00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:27.818
I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,

00:17:27.842 --> 00:17:30.413
but it was one of those two years.

00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:32.572
(Laughter)

00:17:32.596 --> 00:17:39.315
We started the foundation,
just as a convenient way to give charity.

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:42.853
She kept the books, and so on.

00:17:42.877 --> 00:17:49.591
We did not have a vision at that time,
but gradually a vision emerged --

00:17:49.615 --> 00:17:55.119
which was to focus on math and science,
to focus on basic research.

00:17:55.569 --> 00:17:58.341
And that's what we've done.

00:17:58.365 --> 00:18:04.720
Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance
and went to work at the foundation.

00:18:04.744 --> 00:18:06.315
So that's what we do.

00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:09.248
CA: And so Math for America
is basically investing

00:18:09.272 --> 00:18:11.910
in math teachers around the country,

00:18:11.934 --> 00:18:15.736
giving them some extra income,
giving them support and coaching.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.811
And really trying
to make that more effective

00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:21.436
and make that a calling
to which teachers can aspire.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.250
JS: Yeah -- instead of beating up
the bad teachers,

00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:31.127
which has created morale problems
all through the educational community,

00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:33.592
in particular in math and science,

00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:39.746
we focus on celebrating the good ones
and giving them status.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.701
Yeah, we give them extra money,
15,000 dollars a year.

00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:47.192
We have 800 math and science teachers
in New York City in public schools today,

00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:49.030
as part of a core.

00:18:49.054 --> 00:18:52.740
There's a great morale among them.

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:55.270
They're staying in the field.

00:18:55.294 --> 00:18:58.189
Next year, it'll be 1,000
and that'll be 10 percent

00:18:58.213 --> 00:19:01.757
of the math and science teachers
in New York [City] public schools.

00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:07.686
(Applause)

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.120
CA: Jim, here's another project
that you've supported philanthropically:

00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:13.541
Research into origins of life, I guess.

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.012
What are we looking at here?

00:19:15.536 --> 00:19:17.418
JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.

00:19:17.442 --> 00:19:19.604
And then I'll tell you
what you're looking at.

00:19:19.628 --> 00:19:22.684
Origins of life is a fascinating question.

00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:24.241
How did we get here?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.941
Well, there are two questions:

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:32.833
One is, what is the route
from geology to biology --

00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:34.238
how did we get here?

00:19:34.262 --> 00:19:36.626
And the other question is,
what did we start with?

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.752
What material, if any,
did we have to work with on this route?

00:19:39.776 --> 00:19:42.837
Those are two very,
very interesting questions.

00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:49.607
The first question is a tortuous path
from geology up to RNA

00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:51.889
or something like that --
how did that all work?

00:19:51.913 --> 00:19:54.301
And the other,
what do we have to work with?

00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:56.096
Well, more than we think.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.963
So what's pictured there
is a star in formation.

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:05.261
Now, every year in our Milky Way,
which has 100 billion stars,

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:07.780
about two new stars are created.

00:20:07.804 --> 00:20:10.274
Don't ask me how, but they're created.

00:20:10.298 --> 00:20:13.378
And it takes them about a million
years to settle out.

00:20:14.132 --> 00:20:16.308
So, in steady state,

00:20:16.332 --> 00:20:20.180
there are about two million stars
in formation at any time.

00:20:20.204 --> 00:20:23.662
That one is somewhere
along this settling-down period.

00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:27.003
And there's all this crap
sort of circling around it,

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:28.525
dust and stuff.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.502
And it'll form probably a solar system,
or whatever it forms.

00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:34.702
But here's the thing --

00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:41.074
in this dust that surrounds a forming star

00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:47.133
have been found, now,
significant organic molecules.

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:54.097
Molecules not just like methane,
but formaldehyde and cyanide --

00:20:54.121 --> 00:21:00.638
things that are the building blocks --
the seeds, if you will -- of life.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.828
So, that may be typical.

00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:11.329
And it may be typical
that planets around the universe

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.965
start off with some of these
basic building blocks.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.545
Now does that mean
there's going to be life all around?

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.933
Maybe.

00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:24.084
But it's a question
of how tortuous this path is

00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:28.502
from those frail beginnings,
those seeds, all the way to life.

00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:33.718
And most of those seeds
will fall on fallow planets.

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:35.151
CA: So for you, personally,

00:21:35.175 --> 00:21:37.897
finding an answer to this question
of where we came from,

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:41.579
of how did this thing happen,
that is something you would love to see.

00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:43.389
JS: Would love to see.

00:21:43.413 --> 00:21:44.903
And like to know --

00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:50.097
if that path is tortuous enough,
and so improbable,

00:21:50.121 --> 00:21:54.875
that no matter what you start with,
we could be a singularity.

00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:56.488
But on the other hand,

00:21:56.512 --> 00:21:59.990
given all this organic dust
that's floating around,

00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:03.805
we could have lots of friends out there.

00:22:04.947 --> 00:22:06.108
It'd be great to know.

00:22:06.132 --> 00:22:09.612
CA: Jim, a couple of years ago,
I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,

00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:12.473
and I asked him the secret of his success,

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:16.188
and he said taking
physics seriously was it.

00:22:16.696 --> 00:22:20.699
Listening to you, what I hear you saying
is taking math seriously,

00:22:20.723 --> 00:22:23.726
that has infused your whole life.

00:22:24.123 --> 00:22:28.686
It's made you an absolute fortune,
and now it's allowing you to invest

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:33.206
in the futures of thousands and thousands
of kids across America and elsewhere.

00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:36.425
Could it be that science actually works?

00:22:36.449 --> 00:22:39.221
That math actually works?

00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:43.617
JS: Well, math certainly works.
Math certainly works.

00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:44.839
But this has been fun.

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:49.809
Working with Marilyn and giving it away
has been very enjoyable.

00:22:49.833 --> 00:22:52.769
CA: I just find it --
it's an inspirational thought to me,

00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:56.800
that by taking knowledge seriously,
so much more can come from it.

00:22:56.824 --> 00:22:59.842
So thank you for your amazing life,
and for coming here to TED.

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:00.617
Thank you.

00:23:00.651 --> 00:23:01.752
Jim Simons!

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:06.186
(Applause)
