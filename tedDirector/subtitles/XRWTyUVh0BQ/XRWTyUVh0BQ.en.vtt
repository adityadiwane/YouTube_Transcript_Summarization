00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Do we live in a borderless world?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Before you answer that, have a look at this map.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
Contemporary political map shows

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
that we have over 200 countries in the world today.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
That's probably more than at any time in centuries.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Now, many of you will object.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
For you this would be a more appropriate map.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
You could call it TEDistan.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
In TEDistan, there are no borders,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
on this screen, of the many more

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
that will never leave the place in which they were born.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.160
For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
and often violently.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
our basic political geography.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Now this is important, because border conflicts

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Border conflicts can derail

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So I think we need a deeper understanding

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
of how people, money, power,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
religion, culture, technology

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
interact to change the map of the world.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And we can try to anticipate those changes,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and shape them in a more constructive direction.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
So we're going to look at some maps of the past,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
the present and some maps you haven't seen

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
in order to get a sense of where things are going.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Let's start with the world of 1945.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
After World War II, Europe was devastated,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
but still held large overseas colonies:

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
Then over the late '40s,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
waves of decolonization took place.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Over 50 new countries were born.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Then came the end of the Cold War.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and the 'stans of central Asia.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Today we have 200 countries in the world.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
The entire planet is covered

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
by sovereign, independent nation-states.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Eastern Eurasia.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
As you can see on this map,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Russia is still the largest country in the world.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
And as you know, China is the most populous.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And they share a lengthy land border.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
What you don't see on this map

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
is that most of Russia's 150 million people

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
are concentrated in its western provinces

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
and areas that are close to Europe.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
In fact, the World Bank predicts

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
that Russia's population is declining

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
towards about 120 million people

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And there is another thing that you don't see on this map.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
forced Russians out to the far east

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
to be in gulags, labor camps,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
nuclear cities, whatever the case was.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
But as oil prices rose,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Russian governments have invested in infrastructure

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
to unite the country, east and west.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
But nothing has more perversely impacted

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Russia's demographic distribution,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
have gotten on those trains and roads

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
and gone back to the west.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
As a result, in the Russian far east today,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
which is twice the size of India,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
you have exactly six million Russians.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
Why do they call it that?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
China isn't conquering Mongolia.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
It's buying it.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.160
So let's apply this principle to Siberia.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Siberia most of you probably think of

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
But who is it going to feed?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
you have over 100 million people.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
That's larger than the entire population of Russia.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Every single year, for at least a decade or more,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.160
crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
They've taken over the timber industry

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Again, like Mongolia,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
Now maybe this is what the map of the region

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
might look like in 10 to 20 years.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
but it does rhyme.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Again, globalization Chinese style.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
undermine and change the way we think about political geography.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
So, the history of East Asia in fact,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
people don't think about nations and borders.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
usually Chinese or Japanese.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Well it's China's turn again.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
So let's look at how China is re-establishing

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
that hierarchy in the far East.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
It starts with the global hubs.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
that show the hubs of the global economy?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
East Asia today has more of those global hubs

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
than any other region in the world.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
These are the filters and funnels of global capital.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
so much of it being invested into China.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Then there is trade.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
trade relationships that China has

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
with every country in the region.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Specifically, it targets Japan

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
and Korea and Australia,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
countries that are strong allies of the United States.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
and become dependent on exporting to China as well.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And now many of you have been reading in the news

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
how people are looking to China

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.160
to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
such as the East Asian Community.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
Some of these organizations don't even have

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
the United States as a member.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
most countries vow to just sit it out,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
including American allies like Korea and Australia.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Another pillar of the strategy,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
like Russia, is demographic.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
China exports business people, nannies, students,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
teachers to teach Chinese around the region,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
to intermarry and to occupy ever greater

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
commanding heights of the economies.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Already ethnic Chinese people

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
are the real key factors and drivers

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
in the economies there.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
as a result.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
Now it encourages it.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
If you add it all up what do you get?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Well, if you remember before World War II,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
Japan had a vision

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
What's emerging today is what you might call

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
So no matter what the lines on the map tell you

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
in terms of nations and borders,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
what you really have emerging in the far east

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
are national cultures,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
All of this is happening without firing a shot.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
where countries are still very uncomfortable

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
in the borders left behind by European colonialists.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
What lines on the map should we focus on?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
What I want to present to you is what I call

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
state building, day by day.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
Let's start with Iraq.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.160
now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
The reason is Kurdistan.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
The Kurds for 3,000 years

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
have been waging a struggle for independence,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
and now is their chance to finally have it.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
which is an oil-rich region.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
And today, if you go to Kurdistan,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
But what are they guarding?

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
Is it really a border on the map?

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
No. It's the pipelines.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
of their own statehood.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
I don't believe we should.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
behind Saudi Arabia.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
It has no choice but to behave.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
In order to profit from its oil

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
and other countries, and Iraq itself.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
That is, of course, in Palestine.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
30 years of rose garden diplomacy

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
have not delivered us peace in this conflict.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
What might? I believe that what might

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
solve the problem is infrastructure.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
These two arrows are an arc,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
that link the West Bank and Gaza.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
If Gaza can have a functioning port

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
Palestinian economy.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
is that independence alone, without infrastructure,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
is futile.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Now what might this entire region look like

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
when the insecurities might abate?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
The last time that was the case was actually

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
This is the Hejaz Railway.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.160
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
It even had an offshoot running to Haifa

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Now let's look at another part of the world,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
He wanted ethnicities to mingle

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
in ways that would allow him to divide and rule.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
and the way we're talking about it now.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
Before it was, how do we control their oil?

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
Here are just some of the pipeline projections

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
and possibilities and scenarios

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
A great deal of them.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
For a number of countries in this part of the world,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
and for having some meaning

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Just take Azerbaijan.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
as a frozen basket case.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
to provide for Europe,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
and even a potentially Turkmen-

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160
Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
Today most people recognize Kazakhstan

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160
north through Russia, and even east to China.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160
More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
and the less of a dominant Great Game competition

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
we'll have in the 21st century.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
and how that has enhanced its strength.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
And that is, of course, Europe.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
to happen in a peaceful way.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
The E.U. also became a currency block,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
since the end of the Cold War.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
In fact most of that happened on just one day.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and now you have what most people consider

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
a zone of peace spanning 27 countries

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
and 450 million people.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.160
So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Well in light blue, you see the zones

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
or the regions that are at least two-thirds

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
or more dependent on the European Union

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
for trade and investment.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.160
that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
But you can get on a German ICE train

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
and make it almost to Albania.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
On average, every year or two,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
connecting North Africa to Europe.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
on Russia for energy,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
I mentioned Azerbaijan before.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
has become the conduit for 20 percent

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
of Europe's energy supply.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
I don't think it does. I think it's already part of

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
a Euro-Turkish superpower.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
and new countries born?

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
is a very good place to start.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
there is still a tremendous amount of instability.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
that neither of them have dealt constructively

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
This is the flag that flies in the minds

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
of 20 million Pashtuns

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.160
who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.160
Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
Balochistan. Two weeks ago,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.160
Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
and this was the flag that they raised over it.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
The post-colonial entropy

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
that is happening around the world is accelerating,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160
and I expect more such changes to occur in the map

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
as the states fragment.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
Of course, we can't forget Africa.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
53 countries, and by far the most number

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
of suspiciously straight lines on the map.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
If we were to look at all of Africa

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160
we could most certainly acknowledge far more,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
tribal divisions and so forth.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
It has three ongoing civil wars,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
the civil war in the east of the country,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
and south Sudan.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.160
South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.160
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
There is a great race on for energy resources

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
under the Arctic seabed.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
Actually Greenland.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160
Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
voted themselves self-governance rights

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
from Denmark.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
What is the lesson from all of this?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
It's constantly morphing and changing the world,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.160
like climate change.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160
And like our relationship with the ecosystem

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
we're always searching for equilibrium

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
in how we divide ourselves across the planet.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
Now we fear changes on the map.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
We fear civil wars, death tolls,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
having to learn the names of new countries.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160
But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
is far worse and far more violent.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
The question is how do we change those borders,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
and what lines do we focus on?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
the infrastructure lines.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
Thank you.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.160
(Applause)
