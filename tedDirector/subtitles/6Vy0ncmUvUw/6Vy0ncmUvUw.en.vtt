00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
What I want to do today is to spend

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
some time talking about some stuff that's

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
sort of giving me a little bit of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
existential angst, for lack of a better word,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
over the past couple of years, and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
basically, these three quotes

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
tell what's going on.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
"When God made the color purple,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
God was just showing off," Alice Walker

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
wrote in "The Color Purple," and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Zora Neale Hurston wrote in

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
"Dust Tracks On A Road,"

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
"Research is a formalized curiosity.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
It's poking and prying with a purpose."

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
And then finally,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
when I think about the near future,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
you know, we have this attitude, well,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
whatever happens, happens. Right?

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So that goes along with the Chesire Cat

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
saying, "If you don't care much

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
where you want to get to,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
it doesn't much matter which way you go."

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
But I think it does matter

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
which way we go, and what road we take,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
because when I think about design in the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
near future, what I think are the most

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
important issues, what's really

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
crucial and vital is that we need

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
to revitalize the arts and sciences

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
right now in 2002.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.330
(Applause)

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
If we describe the near future

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
as 10, 20, 15 years from now,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
that means that what we do today

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
is going to be critically important,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
because in the year 2015,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
and the year 2020, 2025, the world

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
our society is going to be building on,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
the discoveries that we came up with today,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
just as all these wonderful things we're

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
hearing about here at the TED conference

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
that we take for granted in the world

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
right now, were really knowledge

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
and ideas that came up

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
in the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
That's the substrate that we're exploiting

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
today, whether it's the internet,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
genetic engineering, laser scanners,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
television, sensing, remote-sensing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
from space and the wonderful

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
remote-sensing photos that we see in

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
or Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Be Between These Thighs," which

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
by the way was banned by the FCC,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
or ska, all of these things

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
without question, almost without exception,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
are really based on ideas

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and abstract and creativity

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
from years before,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
so we have to ask ourselves,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
what are we contributing to that legacy

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
right now? And when I think about it,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
I'm really worried. To be quite frank,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
I'm concerned. I'm skeptical

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
that we're doing very much of anything.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
We're, in a sense, failing to act

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
in the future. We're purposefully,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
consciously being laggards.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
We're lagging behind.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
from Martinique, said, "Each generation

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
must, out of relative obscurity,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
discover its mission, and fulfill or betray it."

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
What is our mission? What do we have

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
to do? I think our mission is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
to reconcile, to reintegrate

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
science and the arts, because right now

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
there's a schism that exists

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
in popular culture. You know,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
people have this idea that science

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
and the arts are really separate.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
We think of them as separate

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and different things, and this idea was

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
probably introduced centuries ago,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
but it's really becoming critical now,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
because we're making decisions about our

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
society every day that,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
if we keep thinking that the arts

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
are separate from the sciences,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
and we keep thinking it's cute to say,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
"I don't understand anything about this one,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
I don't understand anything about the other

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
one," then we're going to have problems.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Now I know no one here at TED

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
thinks this. All of us, we already know

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
that they're very connected, but I'm going

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
to let you know that some folks

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
in the outside world, believe it or not,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
they think it's neat when they say,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
"You know, scientists and science is not

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
but they're not creative.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And then we have this tendency, the career

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
counselors and various people say things

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
like, "Artists are not analytical.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
They're ingenious, perhaps,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
but not analytical," and

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
when these concepts underly our teaching

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
and what we think about the world,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
then we have a problem, because we

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
stymie support for everything.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
By accepting this dichotomy,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
whether it's tongue-in-cheek, when

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
we attempt to accommodate it in our world,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
and we try to build our foundation

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
for the world, we're messing up the future,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
because, who wants to be uncreative?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Who wants to be illogical?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
Talent would run from either of these fields

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
if you said you had to choose either.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Then they're going to go to something

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
where they think, "Well, I can be creative

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
and logical at the same time."

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
Now I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
and I was a wannabe hippie and I always

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
resented the fact that I wasn't really

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
old enough to be a hippie.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And I know there are people here, the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
younger generation who want to be hippies,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
but people talk about the '60s all the time,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
and they talk about the anarchy

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
that was there, but when I think about

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
the '60s, what I took away from it was

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
that there was hope for the future.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
We thought everyone could participate.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
There were wonderful, incredible ideas

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
that were always percolating,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
and so much of what's cool or hot today

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
is really based on some of those concepts,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
whether it's, you know, people trying to

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
use the prime directive from Star Trek

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
being involved in things, or again that

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
three-dimensional weaving and

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
fax machines that I read about in my

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
weekly readers that the technology

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
and engineering was just getting started.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
But the '60s left me with a problem.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
You see, I always assumed I would go

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
into space, because I followed all of this,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
but I also loved the arts and sciences.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
You see, when I was growing up as

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
a little girl and as a teenager,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
I loved designing and making dogs' clothes

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
and wanting to be a fashion designer.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
I took art and ceramics. I loved dance.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
And I also avidly followed the Gemini

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
and the Apollo programs.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
I had science projects and tons of astronomy

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
books. I took calculus and philosophy.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
I wondered about the infinity

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
and the Big Bang theory.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And when I was at Stanford,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
I found myself, my senior year,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
chemical engineering major, half the folks

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
thought I was a political science and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
performing arts major, which was sort of

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
true because I was Black Student Union President

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
and I did major in some other things,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
and I found myself the last quarter juggling

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
chemical engineering separation processes,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
spectroscopy, and also producing

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
and choreographing a dance production,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
and I had to do the lighting and the

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
design work, and I was trying to figure out,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
do I go to New York City

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
to try to become a professional dancer,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
or do I go to medical school?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
Now, my mother helped me figure

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
that one out. (Laughter)

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
But when I went into space,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
when I went into space I carried a number

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
of things up with me. I carried a poster

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
by Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
now, I love the dance company.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
performing the dance "Cry," dedicated to all

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
black women everywhere. A Bundu statue,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
which was from the Women's Society

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
in Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
Chicago Public School students to work to

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
improve their science and math,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
and folks asked me,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
"Why did you take up what you took up?"

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
And I had to say,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
"Because it represents human creativity,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
the creativity that allowed us, that we were

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
required to have to conceive and build

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
and launch the space shuttle, springs from

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
the same source as the imagination and

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
or the ingenuity it took to design,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
choreograph, and stage "Cry."

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
Each one of them are different

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
manifestations, incarnations, of creativity,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
avatars of human creativity,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
and that's what we have to reconcile

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
in our minds, how these things fit together.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
The difference between arts and sciences

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
is not analytical versus intuitive, right?

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
E=MC squared required

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
an intuitive leap, and then you had

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
to do the analysis afterwards.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Einstein said, in fact, "The most beautiful

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
thing we can experience is the mysterious.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
It is the source of all true art and science."

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Dance requires us to express and want

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
to express the jubilation in life, but then you

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
have to figure out, exactly

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
what movement do I do to make sure

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
that it comes across correctly?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
The difference between arts and sciences

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
is also not constructive versus

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
deconstructive, right? A lot of people

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
think of the sciences as deconstructive.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
You have to pull things apart.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
And yeah, sub-atomic physics

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
is deconstructive. You literally try to

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
tear atoms apart to understand

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
what's inside of them. But sculpture, from

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
what I understand from great sculptors,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
is deconstructive, because you see a piece

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
and you remove what doesn't

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
need to be there.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
Biotechnology is constructive.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
Orchestral arranging is constructive.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
So in fact we use constructive and

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
deconstructive techniques in everything.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
The difference between science

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
and the arts is not that they

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
are different sides of the same coin, even,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
or even different parts

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
of the same continuum, but rather

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
they're manifestations of the same thing.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
Different quantum states of an atom?

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
I could say that they are different harmonic

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
resonances of a superstring.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
But we'll leave that alone. (Laughter)

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
They spring from the same source.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
The arts and sciences are avatars of

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
human creativity. It's our attempt

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
as humans to build an understanding

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
of the universe, the world around us.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
It's our attempt to influence things,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
the universe internal to ourselves

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
and external to us.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
The sciences, to me, are manifestations

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
of our attempt to express

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
or share our understanding,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
our experience, to influence the universe

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
external to ourselves.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
It's the universe, as experienced

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
by everyone, and the arts manifest

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
our desire, our attempt to share

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
or influence others through experiences

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
that are peculiar to us as individuals.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Let me say it again another way:

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
science provides an understanding

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
of a universal experience, and

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
arts provides a universal understanding

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
of a personal experience.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
That's what we have to think about,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
that they're all part of us, they're

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
all part of a continuum.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
It's not just the tools, it's not just

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
the sciences, you know, the mathematics

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
and the numerical stuff and the statistics,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
because we heard, very much on this

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
stage, people talked about music

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
being mathematical. Right? Arts don't just

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
use clay, aren't the only ones that use clay,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
light and sound and movement.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
They use analysis as well.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
So people might say, well,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
I still like that intuitive versus analytical

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
thing, because everybody wants to do the

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
right brain, left brain thing, right?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
We've all been accused of being

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
right-brained or left-brained at some point

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
in time, depending on who

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
we disagreed with. (Laughter)

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
You know, people say intuitive, you know

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
that's like you're in touch with nature,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
in touch with yourself and relationships.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
Analytical: you put your mind to work, and

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
know this though, but sometimes people

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
use this analysis idea, that things are

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
outside of ourselves, to be, say, that this

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
is what we're going to elevate

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
as the true, most important sciences, right?

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
And then you have artists, and you all

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
know this is true as well,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
artists will say things about scientists

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
because they say they're too concrete,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
they're disconnected with the world.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
But, we've even had that here on stage,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
so don't act like you don't know

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
what I'm talking about. (Laughter)

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
We had folks talking about the Flat Earth

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
Society and flower arrangers, so there's

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
this whole dichotomy that we continue

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
to carry along, even when we know better.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
And folks say we need to choose either or.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
But it would really be foolish to choose

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
either one, right?

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
Intuitive versus analytical?

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
That's a foolish choice. It's foolish,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
just like trying to choose between

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
being realistic or idealistic.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
You need both in life. Why do people

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
do this? I'm just gonna quote

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
"It's always important to distinguish

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
between chastity and impotence."

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
Now... (Laughter)

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
I want to share with you

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
a little equation, okay?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
How do understanding science

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and the arts fit into our lives

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
and what's going on and the things

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
that we're talking about here

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
at the design conference, and this is

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
a little thing I came up with, understanding

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
and our resources and our will

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
cause us to have outcomes.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
Our understanding is our science, our arts,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
our religion, how we see the universe

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
around us, our resources, our money,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
our labor, our minerals, those things

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
that are out there in the world we have

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
to work with.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
But more importantly, there's our will.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
This is our vision, our aspirations

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
of the future, our hopes, our dreams,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
our struggles and our fears.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
Our successes and our failures influence

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
what we do with all of those, and to me,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
design and engineering, craftsmanship and

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
skilled labor, are all the things that work on

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
this to have our outcome,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
which is our human quality of life.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
Where do we want the world to be?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
And guess what?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
Regardless of how we look at this, whether

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
we look at arts and sciences are separate

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
or different, they're both being influenced

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
now and they're both having problems.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Science, Engineering and Education, and

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
it was looking at how to shed light on

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
most effective use of government funding.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
We got a bunch of scientists in all stages

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
of their careers. They came to Dartmouth

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
College, where I was teaching, and they

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
talked about with theologians and financiers,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
what are some of the issues of public

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
funding for science and engineering

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
research? What's most important about it?

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
There are some ideas that emerged that

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
I think have really powerful parallels

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
to the arts. The first thing they said was that

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
the circumstances that we find ourselves in

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
today in the sciences and engineering that

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
made us world leaders is very different

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
and the '70s when we emerged

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
as world leaders, because we're no longer

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
in competition with fascism, with

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
Soviet-style communism, and by the way

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
that competition wasn't just military,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
it included social competition

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
and political competition as well,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
that allowed us to look at space

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
as one of those platforms to prove

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
that our social system was better.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
Another thing they talked about was the

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
infrastructure that supports the sciences

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
is becoming obsolete. We look at

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
universities and colleges, small, mid-sized

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
community colleges across the country,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
their laboratories are becoming obsolete,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
and this is where we train most of our

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
science workers and our researchers,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
and our teachers, by the way,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and then that there's a media that doesn't

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
support the dissemination of any more than

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
the most mundane and inane of information.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
There's pseudo-science, crop circles,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
alien autopsy, haunted houses,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
or disasters. And that's what we see.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
And this isn't really the information

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
you need to operate in everyday life

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
and figure out how to participate in this

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
democracy and determine what's going on.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
They also said that there's a change

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
in the corporate mentality. Whereas

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
government money had always been there

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
for basic science and engineering research,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
we also counted on some companies to do

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
some basic research, but what's happened

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
now is companies put more energy into

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
short-term product development

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
than they do in basic engineering

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
and science research.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
And education is not keeping up.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
In K through 12, people are taking out

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
wet labs. They think if we put a computer

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
in the room it's going to take the place

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
of actually, we're mixing the acids,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
we're growing the potatoes.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
And government funding is decreasing

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
in spending and then they're saying,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
let's have corporations take over,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
and that's not true. Government funding

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
should at least do things like recognize

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
cost-benefits of basic science and

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
engineering research. We have to know

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
that we have a responsibility

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
as global citizens in this world.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
We have to look at the education

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
of humans. We need to build our resources

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
today to make sure that they're trained so

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
that they understand the importance of

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
these things, and we have to support

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
the vitality of science, and that doesn't

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
mean that everything has to have one thing

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
that's going to go on, or we know

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
exactly what's going to be the outcome of it,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
but that we support the vitality and the

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
intellectual curiosity that goes along,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
and if you think about those parallels

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
to the arts, the competition

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
to become better.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
Infrastructure museums, theaters,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.330
movie houses across the country

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
are disappearing. We have more

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.330
television stations with less to watch,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.330
we have more money spent on

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
rewrites to get old television programs

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
in the movies.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
We have corporate funding now that,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
when it goes to some company, when it

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
goes to support the arts, it almost requires

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
that the product be part of the picture

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
that the artist draws, and we have

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
stadiums that are named over and over

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
again by corporations.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.330
In Houston, we're trying to figure out

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
(Laughter) And fine arts and education

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.330
in the schools is disappearing, and we have

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
a government that seems like it's gutting

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
the NEA and other programs,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.330
so we have to really stop and think,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.330
what are we trying to do

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.330
with the sciences and the arts?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.330
There's a need to revitalize them.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
We have to pay attention to it. I just want

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
to tell you really quickly what I'm doing.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:45.330
(Applause)

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
I want to tell you what I've been doing

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
a little bit since... I feel this need

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
to sort of integrate some of the ideas

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.330
that I've had and run across over time.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.330
One of the things that I found out

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.330
is that there's a need to repair

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
the dichotomy between the mind and body

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
as well. My mother always told me,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.330
you have to be observant, know what's

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
going on in your mind and your body,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.330
and as a dancer I had this tremendous

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.330
faith in my ability to know my body,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.330
just as I knew how to sense colors.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.330
Then I went to medical school, and I was

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.330
supposed to just go on

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.330
what the machine said about bodies.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.330
You know, you would ask patients

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.330
questions and some people would tell you,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
"Don't, don't, don't listen to what

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
the patients said." We know that patients

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.330
know and understand their bodies better,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.330
but these days we're trying to divorce them

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
from that idea. We have to reconcile the

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.330
patient's knowledge of their body

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330
with physician's measurements.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.330
We had someone talk about

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.330
measuring emotions and getting machines

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.330
to figure out what, to keep us

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.330
from acting crazy. Right?

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
No, we shouldn't measure,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.330
we shouldn't use machines

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.330
to measure road rage and then do

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.330
something to keep us from engaging in it.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.330
Maybe we can have machines help us

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.330
to recognize that we have road rage and

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.330
then we need to know how to control that

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
without the machines. We even need to be

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.330
able to recognize that without the machines.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.330
What I'm very concerned about

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.330
is how do we bolster our self-awareness

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
as humans, as biological organisms?

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.330
Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
and learn how to feel with my eyes,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
to see with my hands.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.330
We have all kinds of possibilities to use

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
our senses by, and that's

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.330
what we have to do.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.330
That's what I want to do, is to try to use

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.330
bioinstrumentation, those kind of things

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
to help our senses in what we do,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.330
and that's the work I've been doing now as

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.330
a company called BioSentient Corporation.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.330
I figured I'd have to do that ad, because

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.330
I'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
says that that's somebody who does what

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.330
they want to do because they're not broke

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.330
enough that they have to get a real job.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.330
(Laughter) But that's the work I'm doing

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.330
with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.330
out how do we integrate these things?

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.330
Let me finish by saying that

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.330
my personal design issue for the future

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
is really about integrating, to think about

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.330
that intuitive and that analytical.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.330
The arts and sciences are not separate.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.330
High school physics lesson before you

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
leave. High school physics teacher used to

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.330
hold up a ball. She would say this ball

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.330
has potential energy, but nothing

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.330
will happen to it, it can't do any work

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.330
until I drop it and it changes states.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.330
I like to think of ideas as potential energy.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.330
They're really wonderful, but nothing

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
will happen until we risk

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.330
putting them into action.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.330
This conference is filled

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.330
with wonderful ideas.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.330
We're going to share lots of things

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.330
with people, but nothing's going to happen

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.330
until we risk putting those ideas into action.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.330
We need to revitalize the arts and sciences

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.330
of today, we need to take responsibility

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.330
for the future. We can't hide behind saying

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.330
it's just for company profits,

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.330
or it's just a business, or I'm an artist

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.330
or an academician.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.330
Here's how you judge what you're doing.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.330
I talked about that balance between

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.330
intuitive, analytical.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.330
Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.330
she said the three questions

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.330
of greatest concern, now I'm going to

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.330
add on to design, is,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.330
"Is it attractive?"

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.330
That's the intuitive.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.330
"Is it amusing?" The analytical.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.330
"And does it know its place?"

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.330
The balance. Thank you very much.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.330
(Applause)
