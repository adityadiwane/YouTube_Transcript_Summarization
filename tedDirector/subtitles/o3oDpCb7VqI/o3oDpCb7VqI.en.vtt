00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:14.918
This is my great uncle,

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:17.936
my father's father's younger brother.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:19.902
His name was Joe McKenna.

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:25.089
He was a young husband
and a semi-pro basketball player

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.417
and a fireman in New York City.

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:32.007
Family history says
he loved being a fireman,

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.542
and so in 1938, on one of his days off,

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:38.319
he elected to hang out at the firehouse.

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.218
To make himself useful that day,
he started polishing all the brass,

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:46.612
the railings on the fire truck,
the fittings on the walls,

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.957
and one of the fire hose nozzles,

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:51.465
a giant, heavy piece of metal,

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.074
toppled off a shelf and hit him.

00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:59.382
A few days later,
his shoulder started to hurt.

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:02.656
Two days after that, he spiked a fever.

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:05.141
The fever climbed and climbed.

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.091
His wife was taking care of him,

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:11.393
but nothing she did made a difference,
and when they got the local doctor in,

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:13.679
nothing he did mattered either.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.460
They flagged down a cab
and took him to the hospital.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.905
The nurses there recognized right away
that he had an infection,

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:26.061
what at the time they would
have called "blood poisoning,"

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:28.174
and though they probably didn't say it,

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:30.031
they would have known right away

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.430
that there was nothing they could do.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.788
There was nothing they could do
because the things we use now

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.437
to cure infections didn't exist yet.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:43.173
The first test of penicillin,
the first antibiotic,

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:45.843
was three years in the future.

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:50.547
People who got infections
either recovered, if they were lucky,

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:52.042
or they died.

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.411
My great uncle was not lucky.

00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.708
He was in the hospital for a week,
shaking with chills,

00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:59.566
dehydrated and delirious,

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.468
sinking into a coma as his organs failed.

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:04.604
His condition grew so desperate

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:09.234
that the people from his firehouse
lined up to give him transfusions

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:13.097
hoping to dilute the infection
surging through his blood.

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:16.603
Nothing worked. He died.

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:19.705
He was 30 years old.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.088
If you look back through history,

00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:25.362
most people died the way
my great uncle died.

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:28.032
Most people didn't die
of cancer or heart disease,

00:02:28.032 --> 00:02:32.120
the lifestyle diseases that afflict us
in the West today.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.229
They didn't die of those diseases
because they didn't live long enough

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.225
to develop them.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.338
They died of injuries --

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:42.823
being gored by an ox,

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:44.727
shot on a battlefield,

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:48.465
crushed in one of the new factories
of the Industrial Revolution --

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:51.846
and most of the time from infection,

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:55.352
which finished what those injuries began.

00:02:56.492 --> 00:03:00.024
All of that changed
when antibiotics arrived.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.198
Suddenly, infections that had
been a death sentence

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:07.588
became something
you recovered from in days.

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:10.630
It seemed like a miracle,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.954
and ever since, we have been living inside
the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:21.241
And now, we are coming to an end of it.

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:26.303
My great uncle died in the last days
of the pre-antibiotic era.

00:03:26.303 --> 00:03:31.457
We stand today on the threshold
of the post-antibiotic era,

00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:35.219
in the earliest days of a time
when simple infections

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.928
such as the one Joe had
will kill people once again.

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:44.015
In fact, they already are.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.618
People are dying of infections again
because of a phenomenon

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:49.961
called antibiotic resistance.

00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.119
Briefly, it works like this.

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:57.091
Bacteria compete against each other
for resources, for food,

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:01.758
by manufacturing lethal compounds
that they direct against each other.

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:04.103
Other bacteria, to protect themselves,

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:07.354
evolve defenses against
that chemical attack.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:09.676
When we first made antibiotics,

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:13.878
we took those compounds into the lab
and made our own versions of them,

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:18.336
and bacteria responded to our attack
the way they always had.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.898
Here is what happened next:

00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:25.488
Penicillin was distributed in 1943,

00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:30.619
and widespread penicillin resistance
arrived by 1945.

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:33.568
Vancomycin arrived in 1972,

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:36.668
vancomycin resistance in 1988.

00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:39.150
Imipenem in 1985,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.922
and resistance to in 1998.

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:45.860
Daptomycin, one of
the most recent drugs, in 2003,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.225
and resistance to it
just a year later in 2004.

00:04:50.575 --> 00:04:54.335
For 70 years, we played
a game of leapfrog --

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.261
our drug and their resistance,

00:04:57.261 --> 00:05:00.906
and then another drug,
and then resistance again --

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:03.217
and now the game is ending.

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:07.477
Bacteria develop resistance so quickly
that pharmaceutical companies

00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:11.842
have decided making antibiotics
is not in their best interest,

00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:14.652
so there are infections
moving across the world

00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:18.111
for which, out of the more
than 100 antibiotics

00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:20.340
available on the market,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.754
two drugs might work with side effects,

00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:26.238
or one drug,

00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:27.646
or none.

00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:29.668
This is what that looks like.

00:05:30.278 --> 00:05:34.458
In 2000, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the CDC,

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:36.501
identified a single case

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.753
in a hospital in North Carolina

00:05:38.753 --> 00:05:42.486
of an infection resistant
to all but two drugs.

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:47.205
Today, that infection, known as KPC,

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:49.805
has spread to every state but three,

00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:52.150
and to South America, Europe

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.357
and the Middle East.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.189
In 2008, doctors in Sweden

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.975
diagnosed a man from India
with a different infection

00:05:59.975 --> 00:06:03.690
resistant to all but one drug that time.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.919
The gene that creates that resistance,

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.444
known as NDM, has now spread
from India into China, Asia, Africa,

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:16.809
Europe and Canada, and the United States.

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.688
It would be natural to hope

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:23.287
that these infections
are extraordinary cases,

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.145
but in fact,

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:27.606
in the United States and Europe,

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:30.322
50,000 people a year

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.446
die of infections which no drugs can help.

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:38.008
A project chartered
by the British government

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:41.746
known as the Review
on Antimicrobial Resistance

00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:49.118
estimates that the worldwide toll
right now is 700,000 deaths a year.

00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:54.655
That is a lot of deaths,

00:06:54.655 --> 00:06:57.767
and yet, the chances are good
that you don't feel at risk,

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.995
that you imagine these people
were hospital patients

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.713
in intensive care units

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:06.660
or nursing home residents
near the ends of their lives,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.841
people whose infections
are remote from us,

00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:13.045
in situations we can't identify with.

00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:17.852
What you didn't think about,
none of us do,

00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:22.818
is that antibiotics support
almost all of modern life.

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.932
If we lost antibiotics,

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:27.386
here's what else we'd lose:

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:32.015
First, any protection for people
with weakened immune systems --

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:35.475
cancer patients, AIDS patients,

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:39.979
transplant recipients, premature babies.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.391
Next, any treatment that installs
foreign objects in the body:

00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:48.269
stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:52.193
dialysis, joint replacements.

00:07:52.193 --> 00:07:55.908
How many athletic baby boomers
need new hips and knees?

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.717
A recent study estimates
that without antibiotics,

00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:02.234
one out of ever six would die.

00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:05.869
Next, we'd probably lose surgery.

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:08.191
Many operations are preceded

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:11.139
by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:12.811
Without that protection,

00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:17.015
we'd lose the ability to open
the hidden spaces of the body.

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:19.848
So no heart operations,

00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:22.680
no prostate biopsies,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.382
no Cesarean sections.

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:30.444
We'd have to learn to fear infections
that now seem minor.

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:34.592
Strep throat used to cause heart failure.

00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.239
Skin infections led to amputations.

00:08:37.819 --> 00:08:40.722
Giving birth killed,
in the cleanest hospitals,

00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:43.397
almost one woman out of every 100.

00:08:43.717 --> 00:08:48.550
Pneumonia took three children
out of every 10.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.333
More than anything else,

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.708
we'd lose the confident way
we live our everyday lives.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:09:01.043
If you knew that any injury
could kill you,

00:09:01.043 --> 00:09:04.289
would you ride a motorcycle,

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:07.500
bomb down a ski slope,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.976
climb a ladder to hang
your Christmas lights,

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:14.643
let your kid slide into home plate?

00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:18.638
After all, the first person
to receive penicillin,

00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:22.516
a British policeman named
Albert Alexander,

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:26.858
who was so ravaged by infection
that his scalp oozed pus

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.783
and doctors had to take out an eye,

00:09:29.783 --> 00:09:33.162
was infected by doing
something very simple.

00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:38.988
He walked into his garden
and scratched his face on a thorn.

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:44.481
That British project I mentioned
which estimates that the worldwide toll

00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:48.358
right now is 700,000 deaths a year

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:54.535
also predicts that if we can't
get this under control by 2050,

00:09:54.535 --> 00:10:02.127
not long, the worldwide toll
will be 10 million deaths a year.

00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:04.829
How did we get to this point

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:06.864
where what we have to look forward to

00:10:06.864 --> 00:10:10.347
is those terrifying numbers?

00:10:10.347 --> 00:10:14.535
The difficult answer is,
we did it to ourselves.

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:17.847
Resistance is an inevitable
biological process,

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:21.900
but we bear the responsibility
for accelerating it.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.043
We did this by squandering antibiotics

00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:30.131
with a heedlessness
that now seems shocking.

00:10:31.408 --> 00:10:35.494
Penicillin was sold
over the counter until the 1950s.

00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:38.829
In much of the developing world,
most antibiotics still are.

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:42.971
In the United States, 50 percent

00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:46.663
of the antibiotics given
in hospitals are unnecessary.

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:51.037
Forty-five percent of the prescriptions
written in doctor's offices

00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:55.010
are for conditions
that antibiotics cannot help.

00:10:56.577 --> 00:10:59.247
And that's just in healthcare.

00:10:59.247 --> 00:11:04.100
On much of the planet, most meat animals
get antibiotics every day of their lives,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.376
not to cure illnesses,

00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:09.835
but to fatten them up
and to protect them against

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.806
the factory farm conditions
they are raised in.

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:16.824
In the United States, possibly 80 percent

00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:23.527
of the antibiotics sold every year
go to farm animals, not to humans,

00:11:23.527 --> 00:11:27.203
creating resistant bacteria
that move off the farm

00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:29.827
in water, in dust,

00:11:29.827 --> 00:11:32.695
in the meat the animals become.

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:35.910
Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.559
particularly in Asia,

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.902
and fruit growing relies on antibiotics

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:45.801
to protect apples, pears,
citrus, against disease.

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:52.117
And because bacteria can pass
their DNA to each other

00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:56.552
like a traveler handing off
a suitcase at an airport,

00:11:56.552 --> 00:12:01.360
once we have encouraged
that resistance into existence,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.587
there is no knowing where it will spread.

00:12:05.723 --> 00:12:07.294
This was predictable.

00:12:07.674 --> 00:12:10.506
In fact, it was predicted

00:12:10.506 --> 00:12:14.941
by Alexander Fleming,
the man who discovered penicillin.

00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:18.935
He was given the Nobel Prize
in 1945 in recognition,

00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:23.282
and in an interview shortly after,
this is what he said:

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:27.549
"The thoughtless person playing
with penicillin treatment

00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:30.823
is morally responsible
for the death of a man

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:33.147
who succumbs to infection

00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:36.050
with a pencillin-resistant organism."

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.335
He added, "I hope this evil
can be averted."

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:43.842
Can we avert it?

00:12:43.842 --> 00:12:47.510
There are companies working
on novel antibiotics,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.086
things the superbugs
have never seen before.

00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:53.803
We need those new drugs badly,

00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:56.055
and we need incentives:

00:12:56.055 --> 00:12:58.586
discovery grants, extended patents,

00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:05.343
prizes, to lure other companies
into making antibiotics again.

00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:07.709
But that probably won't be enough.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:12.163
Here's why: Evolution always wins.

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:16.627
Bacteria birth a new generation
every 20 minutes.

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:21.410
It takes pharmaceutical chemistry
10 years to derive a new drug.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.266
Every time we use an antibiotic,

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:27.540
we give the bacteria billions of chances

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.281
to crack the codes

00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:32.486
of the defenses we've constructed.

00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:34.877
There has never yet been a drug

00:13:34.877 --> 00:13:37.431
they could not defeat.

00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:40.961
This is asymmetric warfare,

00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:44.969
but we can change the outcome.

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:52.334
We could build systems to harvest data
to tell us automatically and specifically

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:55.263
how antibiotics are being used.

00:13:55.263 --> 00:13:58.096
We could build gatekeeping
into drug order systems

00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:01.811
so that every prescription
gets a second look.

00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:07.920
We could require agriculture
to give up antibiotic use.

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:11.275
We could build surveillance systems

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:15.501
to tell us where resistance
is emerging next.

00:14:15.501 --> 00:14:17.814
Those are the tech solutions.

00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:20.888
They probably aren't enough either,

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:24.117
unless we help.

00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:30.099
Antibiotic resistance is a habit.

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:33.567
We all know how hard it is
to change a habit.

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:38.097
But as a society,
we've done that in the past.

00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:41.972
People used to toss litter
into the streets,

00:14:41.972 --> 00:14:43.737
used to not wear seatbelts,

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:47.994
used to smoke inside public buildings.

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:50.624
We don't do those things anymore.

00:14:51.144 --> 00:14:53.466
We don't trash the environment

00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:56.623
or court devastating accidents

00:14:56.623 --> 00:14:59.595
or expose others
to the possibility of cancer,

00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:03.102
because we decided those things
were expensive,

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:07.175
destructive, not in our best interest.

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:10.715
We changed social norms.

00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:15.279
We could change social norms
around antibiotic use too.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.774
I know that the scale
of antibiotic resistance

00:15:19.774 --> 00:15:21.678
seems overwhelming,

00:15:21.678 --> 00:15:25.138
but if you've ever bought
a fluorescent lightbulb

00:15:25.138 --> 00:15:27.854
because you were concerned
about climate change,

00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:30.989
or read the label on a box of crackers

00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:35.470
because you think about
the deforestation from palm oil,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.349
you already know what it feels like

00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:43.349
to take a tiny step to address
an overwhelming problem.

00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:48.310
We could take those kinds of steps
for antibiotic use too.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:55.947
We could forgo giving an antibiotic
if we're not sure it's the right one.

00:15:56.251 --> 00:16:02.564
We could stop insisting on a prescription
for our kid's ear infection

00:16:02.564 --> 00:16:04.462
before we're sure what caused it.

00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:09.045
We could ask every restaurant,

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:10.856
every supermarket,

00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:12.476
where their meat comes from.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.640
We could promise each other

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.745
never again to buy chicken
or shrimp or fruit

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:21.629
raised with routine antibiotic use,

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:24.323
and if we did those things,

00:16:24.323 --> 00:16:28.815
we could slow down the arrival
of the post-antibiotic world.

00:16:29.547 --> 00:16:33.680
But we have to do it soon.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.185
Penicillin began
the antibiotic era in 1943.

00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:43.891
In just 70 years, we walked ourselves
up to the edge of disaster.

00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:46.613
We won't get 70 years

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:50.339
to find our way back out again.

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:52.279
Thank you very much.

00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:58.640
(Applause)
