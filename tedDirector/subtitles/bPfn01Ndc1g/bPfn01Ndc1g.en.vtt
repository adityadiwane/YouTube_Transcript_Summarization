00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
A few words about how I got started,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.330
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
and very much to myself.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And, kind of as a way of surviving,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
I would go into my own very personal space,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
and I would make things.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
I would make things for people

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
I would go into these private places,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.330
is very much connected with not only the idea realm,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
but also with very much the feeling realm.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
And the ideas are very disparate.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and there's no real connection between one or the other,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
except that they sort of come out of my brain,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.330
by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.330
When I was a child, I started to explore motion.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
I fell in love with the way things moved,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.330
so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
and I remember when I was doing this,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
I was thinking about that little rock there,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.330
and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
and how the characters --

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.330
(Laughter) --

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
would come shooting out of the car,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.330
so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
So, it has to end with this --

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.330
(Laughter) --

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
gratuitous violence.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
(Laughter)

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.330
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and expressed it.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
Now, when I went to college,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.330
I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And this really came about

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
from having many different kinds of interests.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.330
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
and becoming a surgeon,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
because it meant working with my hands

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
in a very focused, intense way.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
So, I started taking art courses,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and I found a way to make sculpture

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:25.330
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.330
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.330
was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
at the same time.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And it's full of many little trivial end points,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.330
like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
and it doesn't really mean anything.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
The connection I have with engineering

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.330
is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
I love to figure things out,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.330
but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
(Laughter)

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
That's pretty ambiguous.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.330
(Laughter)

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.330
The next piece that is going to come up

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.330
is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
I gave myself the problem.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
Since I'm always liking to solve problems,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
and solving all of the mechanical problems

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
for getting this little man to walk back and forth.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
but I did have a sense of the gesture,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
And then it was a matter of starting from one point

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
and sort of building to that final point.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.330
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
And that's a little found object.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
So a lot of the pieces that I've made,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
they involve found objects.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
I imagine what can be said with them.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.330
it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
You know, they say, never play with your food --

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
but I always play with things.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.330
(Laughter)

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And I started to make him walk across the table,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.330
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.330
it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
And that's the whole piece.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.330
(Laughter)

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
That's about that big.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
(Applause)

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.330
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.330
and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
and it is able to achieve the action that I want.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:10.330
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.330
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
and I saw it explode up and out.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And --

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
so the way I saw this in my mind at first,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
and the pieces would move far out,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
and then they would begin to be pulled back

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
with a kind of a gravitational feel,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.330
to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
And they would coalesce for just a moment,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
so you could perceive that there was a chair there.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:57.330
For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
and I wanted to express that.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.330
Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
because obviously you can't move physical matter

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
This whole thing is about four feet wide,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
and the chair itself is only about a few inches.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.330
(Applause)

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.330
and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
So, we have a motor here on the left,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
and it goes through a gear train.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.330
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.330
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.330
is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.330
(Laughter)

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Because it could run all the time.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.330
(Laughter)

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.330
Now, a completely different thought.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.330
I'm always imagining myself in different situations.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
I'm imagining myself as a machine.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
What would I love?

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I would love to be bathed in oil.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.330
(Laughter)

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.330
So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
(Laughter)

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.330
(Applause)

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
And it's really, just sort of --

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.330
(Laughter)

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
And then, I got a call from a friend

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
who wanted to have a show of erotic art,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
and I didn't have any pieces.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.330
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
And this one I call "Machine with Grease."

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.330
(Laughter) --

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.330
(Laughter)

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
It's definitely happy.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
From an engineering point of view,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
this is just a little four-bar linkage.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
and how simply could I state something.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:26.330
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.330
but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.330
For me, the process is very important,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
because I'm inventing machines,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
So this is a little wire-bending tool.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
I made that tool, and then I made this other tool

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
for sort of centering gears very quickly --

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
sort of developing my own little world of technology.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.330
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.330
(Laughter)

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And that was that tool.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It completely changed what I could do.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.330
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
I just like, throw it in.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
So, that's a finished gear.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
When I moved to Boston,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.330
I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.330
(Laughter)

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
pieces of sculpture on the street,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.330
(Laughter)

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and I'm going to have it --

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.330
so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
So, that's what it does.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.330
(Laughter)

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.330
But then in the end, what I decided

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
was every time you finish writing the word,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.330
I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
But I had a lot of fun.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:39.330
(Applause)

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.330
Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:49.330
This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
the most complete kind of piece.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And when I had this thought,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
I was imagining that I would make --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
I would have a whole machine theater evening,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
where I would -- you would have an audience,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.330
the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:19.330
that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:42.330
where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:56.330
which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.330
start off in my own mind, in my heart,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:14.330
and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
and it always feels really crude.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
It's always a struggle,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.330
but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.330
out into an object, and then it's there, OK.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
It means nothing at all.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
The object itself just means nothing.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.330
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.330
then there's a cycle that has been completed.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
And to me, that's the most important thing

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.330
because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.330
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.330
out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.330
So I'll just let this chair come down.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.330
(Applause)

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.330
Thank you.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
(Applause)
