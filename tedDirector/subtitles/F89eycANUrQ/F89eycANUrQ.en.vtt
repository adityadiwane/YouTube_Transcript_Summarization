00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.836
I was 14 years old

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.436
inside of a bowling alley,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.220
burglarizing an arcade game,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.796
and upon exiting the building

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.020
a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.556
I ran down the street,
and I jumped on top of a fence.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.196
And when I got to the top,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.396
the weight of 3,000 quarters
in my book bag

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.060
pulled me back down to the ground.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.756
So when I came to, the security guard
was standing on top of me,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.196
and he said, "Next time you little punks
steal something you can carry."

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.236
(Laughter)

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.396
I was taken to juvenile hall

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.980
and when I was released
into the custody of my mother,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.876
the first words my uncle said was,
"How'd you get caught?"

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.076
I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy."

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.036
He said, "Man, you weren't supposed
to take all the quarters."

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.876
I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do?"

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.796
And 10 minutes later, he took me
to burglarize another arcade game.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460
We needed gas money to get home.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.300
That was my life.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.116
I grew up in Oakland, California,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.476
with my mother and members
of my immediate family

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.740
addicted to crack cocaine.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
My environment consisted
of living with family, friends,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.380
and homeless shelters.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.540
Oftentimes, dinner was served
in breadlines and soup kitchens.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.116
The big homey told me this:

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.116
money rules the world

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.356
and everything in it.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.460
And in these streets, money is king.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.756
And if you follow the money,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.300
it'll lead you to the bad guy
or the good guy.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.436
Soon after, I committed my first crime,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.436
and it was the first time
that I was told that I had potential

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.300
and felt like somebody believed in me.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.196
Nobody ever told me
that I could be a lawyer,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.876
doctor or engineer.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.316
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I couldn't read, write or spell.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.556
I was illiterate.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.140
So I always thought
crime was my way to go.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.996
And then one day

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.276
I was talking to somebody

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.900
and he was telling me
about this robbery that we could do.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.780
And we did it.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.716
The reality was that I was growing up

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.956
in the strongest
financial nation in the world,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.836
the United States of America,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.940
while I watched my mother
stand in line at a blood bank

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.180
to sell her blood for 40 dollars
just to try to feed her kids.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.460
She still has the needle marks
on her arms to day to show for that.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.036
So I never cared about my community.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.556
They didn't care about my life.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.996
Everybody there was doing what they
were doing to take what they wanted,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.196
the drug dealers,
the robbers, the blood bank.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.836
Everybody was taking blood money.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.756
So I got mine by any means necessary.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.356
I got mine.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500
Financial literacy
really did rule the world,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.476
and I was a child slave to it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.740
following the bad guy.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.276
At 17 years old, I was arrested
for robbery and murder

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.276
and I soon learned that finances in prison
rule more than they did on the streets,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.500
so I wanted in.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.476
One day, I rushed to grab
the sports page of the newspaper

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.316
so my cellie could read it to me,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.756
and I accidentally
picked up the business section.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.036
And this old man said,
"Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.316
And I said, "What's that?"

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.516
He said, "That's the place
where white folks keep all their money."

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.756
(Laughter)

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.636
And it was the first time
that I saw a glimpse of hope,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.156
a future.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.780
He gave me this brief description
of what stocks were,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.060
but it was just a glimpse.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.956
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.740
I couldn't read, write or spell.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.036
The skills that I had developed
to hide my illiteracy

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.036
no longer worked in this environment.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.156
I was trapped in a cage,
prey among predators,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.076
fighting for freedom I never had.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.276
I was lost, tired,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.660
and I was out of options.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.596
So at 20 years old,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140
I did the hardest thing
I'd ever done in my life.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.180
I picked up a book,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.700
and it was the most agonizing
time of my life,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.956
trying to learn how to read,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.596
the ostracizing from my family,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.820
the homeys.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.556
It was rough, man.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.956
It was a struggle.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.676
But little did I know

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.116
I was receiving the greatest gifts
I had ever dreamed of:

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.340
self-worth,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.980
knowledge, discipline.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.516
I was so excited to be reading that I read
everything I could get my hands on:

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.875
candy wrappers, clothing logos,
street signs, everything.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.116
I was just reading stuff!

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.156
(Applause)

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.380
Just reading stuff.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.980
I was so excited to know how to read
and know how to spell.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.796
The homey came up, said,
"Man, what you eating?"

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.556
I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy."

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.836
(Laughter)

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.356
He said, "Let me get some."
I said, "N-O. No."

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.596
(Laughter)

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.036
It was awesome.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.236
I mean, I can actually now
for the first time in my life read.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.300
The feeling that I got
from it was amazing.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.660
And then at 22, feeling myself,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.356
feeling confident,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.220
I remembered what the OG told me.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.316
So I picked up the business section
of the newspaper.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.276
I wanted to find these rich white folks.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.900
(Laughter)

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.260
So I looked for that glimpse.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.916
As I furthered my career

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.796
in teaching others how to
financially manage money and invest,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.156
I soon learned that I had to take
responsibility for my own actions.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.196
True, I grew up
in a very complex environment,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.156
but I chose to commit crimes,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.956
and I had to own up to that.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.596
I had to take responsibility
for that, and I did.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.516
I was building a curriculum
that could teach incarcerated men

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.820
how to manage money
through prison employments.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.716
Properly managing our lifestyle
would provide transferrable tools

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.076
that we can use to manage money
when we reenter society,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.356
like the majority of people did
who didn't commit crimes.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.580
Then I discovered

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.556
that according to MarketWatch,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.116
over 60 percent of the American population

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.260
has under 1,000 dollars in savings.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.236
Sports Illustrated said that
over 60 percent of NBA players

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.796
and NFL players go broke.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.860
40 percent of marital problems
derive from financial issues.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.116
What the hell?

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.276
(Laughter)

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.996
You mean to tell me
that people worked their whole lives,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.596
buying cars, clothes,
homes and material stuff

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.836
but were living check to check?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.196
How in the world were members of society
going to help incarcerated individuals

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.436
back into society

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.340
if they couldn't manage they own stuff?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.236
We screwed.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.996
(Laughter)

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.420
I needed a better plan.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.460
This is not going to work out too well.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.060
So ...

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.900
I thought.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.460
I now had an obligation
to meet those on the path

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.396
and help,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.676
and it was crazy because
I now cared about my community.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.060
Wow, imagine that.
I cared about my community.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.756
Financial illiteracy is a disease

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.796
that has crippled minorities
and the lower class in our society

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.956
for generations and generations,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.476
and we should be furious about that.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.076
Ask yourselves this:

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.356
How can 50 percent
of the American population

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.340
be financially illiterate in a nation
driven by financial prosperity?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.676
Our access to justice, our social status,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.716
living conditions, transportation and food

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.796
are all dependent on money
that most people can't manage.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.396
It's crazy!

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.796
It's an epidemic

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.820
and a bigger danger to public safety
than any other issue.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.196
According to the California
Department of Corrections,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.556
over 70 percent of those incarcerated

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.196
have committed or have been charged
with money-related crimes:

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.740
robberies, burglaries,
fraud, larceny, extortion --

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.860
and the list goes on.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.956
Check this out:

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.916
a typical incarcerated person

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.436
would enter the California prison system

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.020
with no financial education,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.636
earn 30 cents an hour,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.876
over 800 dollars a year,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.660
with no real expenses and save no money.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.916
Upon his parole, he will be given
200 dollars gate money and told,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.020
"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.
Don't come back to prison."

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.916
With no meaningful preparation
or long-term financial plan,

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.140
what does he do ... ?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.620
At 60?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.276
Get a good job,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.220
or go back to the very criminal behavior
that led him to prison in the first place?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.996
You taxpayers, you choose.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.180
Well, his education
already chose for him, probably.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.300
So how do we cure this disease?

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.796
I cofounded a program

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.396
that we call Financial Empowerment
Emotional Literacy.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.876
We call it FEEL,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.076
and it teaches how do you separate
your emotional decisions

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.076
from your financial decisions,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.516
and the four timeless rules
to personal finance:

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.100
the proper way to save,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.020
control your cost of living,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.916
borrow money effectively

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.716
and diversify your finances
by allowing your money to work for you

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.556
instead of you working for it.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.740
Incarcerated people need these life skills
before we reenter society.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.196
You can't have full rehabilitation
without these life skills.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.036
This idea that only professionals
can invest and manage money

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.316
is absolutely ridiculous,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.007
and whoever told you that is lying.

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:29.996
(Applause)

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.436
A professional is a person

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.956
who knows his craft better than most,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.916
and nobody knows how much money
you need, have or want better than you,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.900
which means you are the professional.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.916
Financial literacy is not a skill,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.140
It's a lifestyle.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.876
Financial stability is a byproduct
of a proper lifestyle.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.700
A financially sound incarcerated person
can become a taxpaying citizen,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.996
and a financially sound
taxpaying citizen can remain one.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.356
This allows us to create a bridge
between those people who we influence:

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.116
family, friends and those young people

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.060
who still believe
that crime and money are related.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.436
So let's lose the fear and anxiety

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.916
of all the big financial words

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.516
and all that other nonsense
that you've been out there hearing.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.396
And let's get to the heart
of what's been crippling our society

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.780
from taking care of your responsibility
to be better life managers.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.156
And let's provide a simple
and easy to use curriculum

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.436
that gets to the heart, the heart

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.396
of what financial empowerment
and emotional literacy really is.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.316
Now, if you're sitting out here
in the audience and you said,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.756
"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me
and I don't buy it,"

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.076
then come take my class --

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.796
(Laughter)

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.500
so I can show you how much money
it costs you every time you get emotional.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.940
(Applause)

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.956
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.140
(Applause)
