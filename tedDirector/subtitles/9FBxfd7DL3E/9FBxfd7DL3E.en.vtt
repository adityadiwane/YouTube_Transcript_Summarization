00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:15.676
When I was President of the American
Psychological Association,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.326
they tried to media-train me.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.913
And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.038
what I'm going to be talking about today,

00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:28.136
which is the eleventh reason
to be optimistic.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.336
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them;

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.454
I'm going to give you the eleventh.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:40.237
So they came to me, CNN,
and they said, "Professor Seligman --

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.923
would you tell us about the state
of psychology today?

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:46.864
We'd like to interview you about that."

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:48.102
And I said, "Great."

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:52.459
And she said, "But this is CNN,
so you only get a sound bite."

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.937
I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"

00:00:56.707 --> 00:00:58.344
And she said, "Well, one."

00:00:58.368 --> 00:00:59.724
(Laughter)

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:02.517
And the cameras rolled, and she said,

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.858
"Professor Seligman,
what is the state of psychology today?"

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:08.547
"Good."

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.699
(Laughter)

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:13.723
"Cut! Cut. That won't do.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:17.846
We'd really better give
you a longer sound bite."

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.600
"How many words do I get this time?"

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:21.040
"Well, you get two."

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.796
(Laughter)

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.924
"Doctor Seligman, what is the state
of psychology today?"

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:28.939
"Not good."

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:35.963
(Laughter)

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:41.889
"Look, Doctor Seligman,

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:44.907
we can see you're really
not comfortable in this medium.

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.320
We'd better give you a real sound bite.

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:49.899
This time you can have three words.

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.878
Professor Seligman, what is the state
of psychology today?"

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:56.512
"Not good enough."

00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:00.249
That's what I'm going to be talking about.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:04.382
I want to say why psychology
was good, why it was not good,

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:08.506
and how it may become,
in the next 10 years, good enough.

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:13.214
And by parallel summary, I want to say
the same thing about technology,

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:14.943
about entertainment and design,

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.148
because I think the issues
are very similar.

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.169
So, why was psychology good?

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:25.136
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology
worked within the disease model.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.136
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.183
and I introduced myself to my seatmate,
and told them what I did,

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:32.800
they'd move away from me,

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.473
because, quite rightly, they were saying

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:39.096
psychology is about finding
what's wrong with you.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.531
Spot the loony.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:44.510
And now, when I tell people
what I do, they move toward me.

00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:49.340
What was good about psychology --

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:52.386
about the $30 billion
investment NIMH made,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.136
about working in the disease model,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.617
about what you mean by psychology --

00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:01.031
is that, 60 years ago,
none of the disorders were treatable;

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.967
it was entirely smoke and mirrors.

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:05.454
And now, 14 of the disorders
are treatable,

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.382
two of them actually curable.

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:12.616
And the other thing that happened
is that a science developed,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.568
a science of mental illness.

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:19.368
We found out we could take fuzzy concepts

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:22.372
like depression, alcoholism,

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:23.987
and measure them with rigor;

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:28.258
that we could create a classification
of the mental illnesses;

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:33.285
that we could understand
the causality of the mental illnesses.

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.136
We could look across time
at the same people --

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.137
people, for example, who were genetically
vulnerable to schizophrenia --

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:46.373
and ask what the contribution
of mothering, of genetics are,

00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:48.761
and we could isolate third variables

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:51.136
by doing experiments
on the mental illnesses.

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.151
And best of all, we were able,
in the last 50 years,

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.004
to invent drug treatments
and psychological treatments.

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:03.136
And then we were able
to test them rigorously,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.453
in random-assignment,
placebo-controlled designs,

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:08.729
throw out the things that didn't work,

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.477
keep the things that actively did.

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:14.019
The conclusion of that is,

00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:17.136
psychology and psychiatry
of the last 60 years

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.313
can actually claim that we can make
miserable people less miserable.

00:04:22.818 --> 00:04:24.970
And I think that's terrific.

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.380
I'm proud of it.

00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:33.561
But what was not good,
the consequences of that,

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:35.091
were three things.

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:36.893
The first was moral;

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:41.711
that psychologists and psychiatrists
became victimologists, pathologizers;

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.777
that our view of human nature
was that if you were in trouble,

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:46.198
bricks fell on you.

00:04:46.574 --> 00:04:49.315
And we forgot that people
made choices and decisions.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:50.837
We forgot responsibility.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:52.903
That was the first cost.

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:57.136
The second cost was
that we forgot about you people.

00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:01.236
We forgot about improving normal lives.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.136
We forgot about a mission to make
relatively untroubled people happier,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.940
more fulfilled, more productive.

00:05:09.964 --> 00:05:13.270
And "genius," "high-talent,"
became a dirty word.

00:05:13.687 --> 00:05:15.223
No one works on that.

00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:19.136
And the third problem
about the disease model is,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.441
in our rush to do something
about people in trouble,

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:26.181
in our rush to do something
about repairing damage,

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.208
it never occurred to us
to develop interventions

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:33.991
to make people happier --
positive interventions.

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:36.336
So that was not good.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.189
And so that's what led people
like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,

00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:43.122
Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself

00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:46.006
to work in something I call,
"positive psychology,"

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.442
which has three aims.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.725
The first is that psychology
should be just as concerned

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:55.465
with human strength
as it is with weakness.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.806
It should be just as concerned
with building strength

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.968
as with repairing damage.

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:05.675
It should be interested
in the best things in life.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.573
And it should be just as concerned

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:11.310
with making the lives
of normal people fulfilling,

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:15.283
and with genius,
with nurturing high talent.

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:20.711
So in the last 10 years
and the hope for the future,

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:24.136
we've seen the beginnings
of a science of positive psychology,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.335
a science of what makes life worth living.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.244
It turns out that we can measure
different forms of happiness.

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:34.748
And any of you, for free,
can go to that website --

00:06:34.772 --> 00:06:36.163
[www.authentichappiness.org]

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.666
and take the entire panoply
of tests of happiness.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.136
You can ask, how do you stack
up for positive emotion, for meaning,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.188
for flow, against literally tens
of thousands of other people?

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:53.136
We created the opposite of the diagnostic
manual of the insanities:

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.381
a classification of the strengths
and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,

00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:00.611
how they're defined, how to diagnose them,

00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:03.453
what builds them
and what gets in their way.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.599
We found that we could discover
the causation of the positive states,

00:07:09.623 --> 00:07:13.136
the relationship between left
hemispheric activity

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.160
and right hemispheric activity,
as a cause of happiness.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.637
I've spent my life working
on extremely miserable people,

00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.048
and I've asked the question:

00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:28.725
How do extremely miserable people
differ from the rest of you?

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:33.136
And starting about six years ago,
we asked about extremely happy people.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.700
How do they differ from the rest of us?

00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:39.207
It turns out there's one way,
very surprising --

00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.899
they're not more religious,
they're not in better shape,

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:45.011
they don't have more money,
they're not better looking,

00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:47.790
they don't have more good events
and fewer bad events.

00:07:47.814 --> 00:07:51.202
The one way in which they differ:
they're extremely social.

00:07:52.964 --> 00:07:55.665
They don't sit in seminars
on Saturday morning.

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.644
(Laughter)

00:08:00.137 --> 00:08:01.637
They don't spend time alone.

00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:03.859
Each of them is in a romantic relationship

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:07.031
and each has a rich repertoire of friends.

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:11.432
But watch out here -- this is merely
correlational data, not causal,

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:15.054
and it's about happiness
in the first, "Hollywood" sense,

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.290
I'm going to talk about,

00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:20.480
happiness of ebullience
and giggling and good cheer.

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:23.339
And I'm going to suggest to you
that's not nearly enough,

00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:24.513
in just a moment.

00:08:25.584 --> 00:08:29.965
We found we could begin to look
at interventions over the centuries,

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:31.782
from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:36.589
About 120 interventions have been proposed
that allegedly make people happy.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:41.638
And we find that we've been able
to manualize many of them,

00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:43.581
and we actually carry out

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:47.247
random-assignment efficacy
and effectiveness studies.

00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:51.427
That is, which ones actually
make people lastingly happier?

00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:54.678
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you
about some of those results.

00:08:54.702 --> 00:09:01.136
But the upshot of this is that the mission
I want psychology to have,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.647
in addition to its mission
of curing the mentally ill,

00:09:04.671 --> 00:09:08.945
and in addition to its mission of making
miserable people less miserable,

00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:12.540
is, can psychology actually
make people happier?

00:09:12.922 --> 00:09:17.068
And to ask that question -- "happy"
is not a word I use very much --

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.008
we've had to break it down

00:09:19.032 --> 00:09:21.564
into what I think
is askable about "happy."

00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:24.574
And I believe there are three different --

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:28.622
I call them "different" because different
interventions build them,

00:09:28.646 --> 00:09:31.047
it's possible to have one
rather than the other --

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.048
three different happy lives.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:36.189
The first happy life is the pleasant life.

00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:39.598
This is a life in which you have
as much positive emotion

00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:41.136
as you possibly can,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.261
and the skills to amplify it.

00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:45.465
The second is a life of engagement:

00:09:45.489 --> 00:09:50.854
a life in your work, your parenting,
your love, your leisure;

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:52.184
time stops for you.

00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:55.350
That's what Aristotle was talking about.

00:09:55.374 --> 00:09:57.441
And third, the meaningful life.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:10:00.136
I want to say a little bit
about each of those lives

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.977
and what we know about them.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:06.979
The first life is the pleasant life,
and it's simply, as best we can find it,

00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:09.290
it's having as many
of the pleasures as you can,

00:10:09.314 --> 00:10:11.423
as much positive emotion as you can,

00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:17.935
and learning the skills -- savoring,
mindfulness -- that amplify them,

00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:21.136
that stretch them over time and space.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.136
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.668
and it's why positive psychology
is not happy-ology,

00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:30.569
and why it doesn't end here.

00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:34.136
The first drawback is,
it turns out the pleasant life,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.597
your experience of positive emotion,

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:41.542
is about 50 percent heritable,

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:45.136
and, in fact, not very modifiable.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.699
So the different tricks
that Matthieu and I and others know

00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:53.334
about increasing the amount
of positive emotion in your life

00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:57.334
are 15 to 20 percent tricks,
getting more of it.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:01.898
Second is that positive
emotion habituates.

00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:05.722
It habituates rapidly, indeed.

00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:08.116
It's all like French vanilla ice cream:

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.755
the first taste is 100 percent;

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:12.948
by the time you're down
to the sixth taste,

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:14.129
it's gone.

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:18.949
And, as I said,
it's not particularly malleable.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.467
And this leads to the second life.

00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:24.429
I have to tell you about my friend Len,

00:11:24.453 --> 00:11:30.364
to talk about why positive psychology
is more than positive emotion,

00:11:30.388 --> 00:11:32.136
more than building pleasure.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.136
In two of the three great arenas
of life, by the time Len was 30,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.584
Len was enormously successful.

00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:42.136
The first arena was work.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.796
By the time he was 20,
he was an options trader.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.247
By the time he was 25,
he was a multimillionaire

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.617
and the head of an options
trading company.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.307
Second, in play, he's a national
champion bridge player.

00:11:57.366 --> 00:12:02.136
But in the third great arena of life,
love, Len is an abysmal failure.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.102
And the reason he was,
was that Len is a cold fish.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.310
(Laughter)

00:12:10.254 --> 00:12:12.160
Len is an introvert.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:18.136
American women said to Len,
when he dated them,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.136
"You're no fun. You don't have
positive emotion. Get lost."

00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:28.136
And Len was wealthy enough to be able
to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.904
who for five years tried
to find the sexual trauma

00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:35.354
that had somehow locked
positive emotion inside of him.

00:12:35.897 --> 00:12:39.051
But it turned out there wasn't
any sexual trauma.

00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:41.266
It turned out that --

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.669
Len grew up in Long Island

00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:49.275
and he played football
and watched football, and played bridge.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:54.746
Len is in the bottom five percent
of what we call positive affectivities.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.555
The question is: Is Len unhappy?

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.237
And I want to say, not.

00:12:58.587 --> 00:13:01.546
Contrary to what psychology told us

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.722
about the bottom 50 percent
of the human race in positive affectivity,

00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:08.338
I think Len is one
of the happiest people I know.

00:13:08.362 --> 00:13:11.008
He's not consigned
to the hell of unhappiness,

00:13:11.032 --> 00:13:14.947
and that's because Len, like most of you,

00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:17.033
is enormously capable of flow.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:20.031
When he walks onto the floor
of the American Exchange

00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:21.805
at 9:30 in the morning,

00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:23.609
time stops for him.

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:25.395
And it stops till the closing bell.

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:28.319
When the first card is played
till 10 days later,

00:13:28.343 --> 00:13:29.701
when the tournament is over,

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.135
time stops for Len.

00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:35.048
And this is indeed
what Mike Csikszentmihalyi

00:13:35.072 --> 00:13:36.974
has been talking about, about flow.

00:13:36.998 --> 00:13:40.375
And it's distinct from pleasure
in a very important way:

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:45.803
pleasure has raw feel -- you know
it's happening; it's thought and feeling.

00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:48.916
But what Mike told you
yesterday -- during flow ...

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:53.184
you can't feel anything.

00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:56.383
You're one with the music.

00:13:56.824 --> 00:13:58.077
Time stops.

00:13:58.101 --> 00:13:59.995
You have intense concentration.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:04.770
And this is indeed the characteristic
of what we think of as the good life.

00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:08.047
And we think there's a recipe for it,

00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:10.665
and it's knowing what
your highest strengths are --

00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:12.983
again, there's a valid test

00:14:13.007 --> 00:14:15.390
of what your five highest strengths are --

00:14:15.414 --> 00:14:18.143
and then re-crafting your life

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:21.427
to use them as much as you possibly can.

00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:24.136
Re-crafting your work, your love,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.917
your play, your friendship,
your parenting.

00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:28.521
Just one example.

00:14:29.248 --> 00:14:32.856
One person I worked with
was a bagger at Genuardi's.

00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:34.481
Hated the job.

00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:36.398
She's working her way through college.

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:40.064
Her highest strength
was social intelligence.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:44.803
So she re-crafted bagging
to make the encounter with her

00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:47.598
the social highlight
of every customer's day.

00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:49.798
Now, obviously she failed.

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:53.136
But what she did was to take
her highest strengths,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.568
and re-craft work to use them
as much as possible.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.508
What you get out of that
is not smiley-ness.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:01.435
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:02.863
You don't giggle a lot.

00:15:02.887 --> 00:15:05.473
What you get is more absorption.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.234
So, that's the second path.

00:15:08.258 --> 00:15:10.610
The first path, positive emotion;

00:15:10.634 --> 00:15:13.730
the second path is eudaemonian flow;

00:15:13.754 --> 00:15:16.136
and the third path is meaning.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.136
This is the most venerable
of the happinesses, traditionally.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.659
And meaning, in this view, consists of --

00:15:23.683 --> 00:15:26.603
very parallel to eudaemonia --

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:30.190
it consists of knowing
what your highest strengths are,

00:15:30.214 --> 00:15:34.857
and using them to belong to
and in the service of

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:37.024
something larger than you are.

00:15:39.082 --> 00:15:42.334
I mentioned that for all three
kinds of lives --

00:15:43.407 --> 00:15:46.750
the pleasant life, the good life,
the meaningful life --

00:15:46.774 --> 00:15:48.938
people are now
hard at work on the question:

00:15:48.962 --> 00:15:52.889
Are there things that lastingly
change those lives?

00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:56.927
And the answer seems to be yes.

00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:59.506
And I'll just give you some samples of it.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.694
It's being done in a rigorous manner.

00:16:01.718 --> 00:16:04.555
It's being done in the same way
that we test drugs

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:06.188
to see what really works.

00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:11.486
So we do random-assignment,
placebo-controlled,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.357
long-term studies
of different interventions.

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:18.886
Just to sample the kind of interventions
that we find have an effect:

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.136
when we teach people
about the pleasant life,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.136
how to have more pleasure in your life,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.179
one of your assignments
is to take the mindfulness skills,

00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:30.618
the savoring skills,

00:16:30.642 --> 00:16:33.400
and you're assigned
to design a beautiful day.

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:39.347
Next Saturday, set a day aside,
design yourself a beautiful day,

00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:43.565
and use savoring and mindfulness
to enhance those pleasures.

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:48.090
And we can show in that way
that the pleasant life is enhanced.

00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:51.122
Gratitude visit.

00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:55.899
I want you all to do this
with me now, if you would.

00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:57.171
Close your eyes.

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:03.316
I'd like you to remember someone

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.388
who did something enormously important

00:17:06.412 --> 00:17:10.136
that changed your life
in a good direction,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.093
and who you never properly thanked.

00:17:13.307 --> 00:17:14.796
The person has to be alive.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.323
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.

00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:20.681
I hope all of you have such a person.

00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:24.303
Your assignment, when you're learning
the gratitude visit,

00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:27.976
is to write a 300-word
testimonial to that person,

00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:30.623
call them on the phone in Phoenix,

00:17:31.321 --> 00:17:33.968
ask if you can visit, don't tell them why.

00:17:33.992 --> 00:17:35.495
Show up at their door,

00:17:36.459 --> 00:17:40.456
you read the testimonial --
everyone weeps when this happens.

00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:44.641
And what happens is, when we test people

00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:47.784
one week later, a month later,
three months later,

00:17:47.808 --> 00:17:50.466
they're both happier and less depressed.

00:17:51.882 --> 00:17:54.217
Another example is a strengths date,

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.423
in which we get couples to identify
their highest strengths

00:17:58.447 --> 00:17:59.822
on the strengths test,

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:04.927
and then to design an evening
in which they both use their strengths.

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.444
We find this is a strengthener
of relationships.

00:18:08.948 --> 00:18:10.922
And fun versus philanthropy.

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:13.666
It's so heartening
to be in a group like this,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.290
in which so many of you have turned
your lives to philanthropy.

00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:20.972
Well, my undergraduates and the people
I work with haven't discovered this,

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:23.804
so we actually have people
do something altruistic

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:26.246
and do something fun,

00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:27.511
and contrast it.

00:18:27.535 --> 00:18:30.136
And what you find
is when you do something fun,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.049
it has a square wave walk set.

00:18:32.073 --> 00:18:35.709
When you do something philanthropic
to help another person,

00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:37.822
it lasts and it lasts.

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:42.206
So those are examples
of positive interventions.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.256
So the next to last thing
I want to say is:

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.279
we're interested in how much
life satisfaction people have.

00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:52.243
This is really what you're about.

00:18:52.267 --> 00:18:54.136
And that's our target variable.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.136
And we ask the question as a function
of the three different lives,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.376
how much life satisfaction do you get?

00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:04.012
So we ask -- and we've done this
in 15 replications,

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:06.414
involving thousands of people:

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.933
To what extent does
the pursuit of pleasure,

00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:10.729
the pursuit of positive emotion,

00:19:11.303 --> 00:19:12.477
the pleasant life,

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:15.909
the pursuit of engagement,
time stopping for you,

00:19:15.933 --> 00:19:19.307
and the pursuit of meaning
contribute to life satisfaction?

00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:22.925
And our results surprised us;
they were backward of what we thought.

00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:26.453
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure
has almost no contribution

00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:28.136
to life satisfaction.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.689
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.

00:19:30.713 --> 00:19:34.860
The pursuit of engagement
is also very strong.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.794
Where pleasure matters
is if you have both engagement

00:19:39.818 --> 00:19:41.427
and you have meaning,

00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:43.740
then pleasure's the whipped
cream and the cherry.

00:19:43.764 --> 00:19:50.282
Which is to say, the full life --
the sum is greater than the parts,

00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:51.712
if you've got all three.

00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:54.978
Conversely, if you have none
of the three, the empty life,

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:56.659
the sum is less than the parts.

00:19:56.683 --> 00:20:00.934
And what we're asking now is:
Does the very same relationship --

00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:05.901
physical health, morbidity,
how long you live and productivity --

00:20:05.925 --> 00:20:07.334
follow the same relationship?

00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:09.836
That is, in a corporation,

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:15.699
is productivity a function of positive
emotion, engagement and meaning?

00:20:15.723 --> 00:20:18.890
Is health a function
of positive engagement,

00:20:18.914 --> 00:20:21.651
of pleasure, and of meaning in life?

00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:25.890
And there is reason to think the answer
to both of those may well be yes.

00:20:28.364 --> 00:20:32.793
So, Chris said that the last
speaker had a chance

00:20:32.817 --> 00:20:35.238
to try to integrate what he heard,

00:20:35.262 --> 00:20:36.968
and so this was amazing for me.

00:20:36.992 --> 00:20:40.286
I've never been in a gathering like this.

00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:44.685
I've never seen speakers stretch
beyond themselves so much,

00:20:44.709 --> 00:20:46.781
which was one of the remarkable things.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.136
But I found that the problems
of psychology seemed to be parallel

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.375
to the problems of technology,
entertainment and design

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:56.874
in the following way:

00:20:56.898 --> 00:21:00.380
we all know that technology,
entertainment and design

00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:05.404
have been and can be used
for destructive purposes.

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:10.686
We also know that technology,
entertainment and design

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.229
can be used to relieve misery.

00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:17.136
And by the way, the distinction
between relieving misery

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.136
and building happiness
is extremely important.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.771
I thought, when I first became
a therapist 30 years ago,

00:21:23.795 --> 00:21:29.136
that if I was good enough
to make someone not depressed,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.208
not anxious, not angry,

00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:34.493
that I'd make them happy.

00:21:35.062 --> 00:21:36.437
And I never found that;

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.483
I found the best you could ever do

00:21:38.507 --> 00:21:39.909
was to get to zero;

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.724
that they were empty.

00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:47.354
And it turns out the skills of happiness,
the skills of the pleasant life,

00:21:47.378 --> 00:21:49.749
the skills of engagement,
the skills of meaning,

00:21:49.773 --> 00:21:53.924
are different from the skills
of relieving misery.

00:21:54.495 --> 00:21:59.866
And so, the parallel thing holds
with technology, entertainment

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.463
and design, I believe.

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:08.366
That is, it is possible
for these three drivers of our world

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.605
to increase happiness,

00:22:10.918 --> 00:22:13.806
to increase positive emotion.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.017
And that's typically
how they've been used.

00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:18.651
But once you fractionate
happiness the way I do --

00:22:19.063 --> 00:22:22.136
not just positive emotion,
that's not nearly enough --

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.293
there's flow in life,
and there's meaning in life.

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:27.136
As Laura Lee told us,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.828
design and, I believe,
entertainment and technology,

00:22:30.852 --> 00:22:35.583
can be used to increase meaning
engagement in life as well.

00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:37.227
So in conclusion,

00:22:37.251 --> 00:22:39.678
the eleventh reason for optimism,

00:22:39.702 --> 00:22:42.877
in addition to the space elevator,

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:48.032
is that I think with technology,
entertainment and design,

00:22:48.056 --> 00:22:51.804
we can actually increase
the amount of tonnage

00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:54.078
of human happiness on the planet.

00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:58.944
And if technology can,
in the next decade or two,

00:22:58.968 --> 00:23:02.832
increase the pleasant life,
the good life and the meaningful life,

00:23:02.856 --> 00:23:04.346
it will be good enough.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:09.975
If entertainment can be diverted
to also increase positive emotion,

00:23:10.127 --> 00:23:13.221
meaning eudaemonia,

00:23:13.245 --> 00:23:14.684
it will be good enough.

00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:19.274
And if design can increase
positive emotion,

00:23:20.742 --> 00:23:23.737
eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,

00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:27.300
what we're all doing together
will become good enough.

00:23:27.324 --> 00:23:28.503
Thank you.

00:23:28.527 --> 00:23:34.329
(Applause)
