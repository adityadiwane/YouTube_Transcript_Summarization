00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.304
The youthful perspective on the future,

00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:19.482
the present perspective on the future

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:24.053
and the future, mature
perspective on the future --

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.598
I'd like to try and bring
all those three tenses together

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:30.751
in one identity tonight.

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:34.582
And you could say
that the poet, in many ways,

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:38.398
looks at what I call
"the conversational nature of reality."

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.678
And you ask yourself:

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:42.933
What is the conversational
nature of reality?

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:46.275
The conversational nature
of reality is the fact

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.469
that whatever you desire of the world --

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.897
whatever you desire of your partner
in a marriage or a love relationship,

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.928
whatever you desire of your children,

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:59.765
whatever you desire of the people
who work for you or with you,

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.137
or your world --

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.643
will not happen exactly
as you would like it to happen.

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.839
But equally,

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.155
whatever the world desires of us --

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.154
whatever our partner,
our child, our colleague,

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:15.367
our industry,

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.078
our future demands of us,

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:19.796
will also not happen.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.773
And what actually happens

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:26.177
is this frontier
between what you think is you

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.037
and what you think is not you.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.198
And this frontier of actual meeting

00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:34.316
between what we call a self
and what we call the world

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.058
is the only place, actually,
where things are real.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:39.070
But it's quite astonishing,

00:01:39.094 --> 00:01:43.275
how little time we spend
at this conversational frontier,

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:48.958
and not abstracted away from it
in one strategy or another.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:54.197
I was coming through immigration,

00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.721
which is quite a dramatic
border at the moment,

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.202
into the US last year,

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.191
and, you know, you get off
an international flight

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.367
across the Atlantic,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.086
and you're not in the best place;

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.663
you're not at your most
spiritually mature.

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:11.952
You're quite impatient
with the rest of humanity, in fact.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:16.351
So when you get up to immigration
with your shirt collar out

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.864
and a day's growth of beard,

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:21.227
and you have very little patience,

00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:23.979
and the immigration officer
looked at my passport

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.111
and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:31.277
I said, "I work with the conversational
nature of reality."

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:35.212
(Laughter)

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.053
And he leaned forward over his podium

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:42.007
and he said, "I needed you last night."

00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.419
(Laughter)

00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:46.747
(Applause)

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:49.333
And I said, "I'm sorry,

00:02:49.357 --> 00:02:52.440
my powers as a poet
and philosopher only go so far.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.677
I'm not sure I can --"

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.238
But before we knew it,

00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:58.692
we were into a conversation
about his marriage.

00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:00.389
Here he was in his uniform,

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.881
and the interesting thing was,

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.118
he was looking up and down
the row of officers

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.171
to make sure his supervisor didn't see

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.685
that we was having a real conversation.

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:13.893
But all of us live
at this conversational frontier

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.005
with the future.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.783
I'd like to put you in the shoes
of my Irish niece,

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:21.558
Marlene McCormack,

00:03:21.582 --> 00:03:25.026
standing on a cliff edge
on the western coast of Spain,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.057
overlooking the broad Atlantic.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:30.838
Twenty-three years old,
she's just walked 500 miles

00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:34.444
from Saint Jean Pied de Port
on the French side of the Pyrenees,

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:36.245
all the way across Northern Spain,

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.280
on this very famous,
old and contemporary pilgrimage

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:43.839
called the Camino de Santiago
de Compostela --

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:46.779
the Path to Santiago of Compostela.

00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:51.251
And when you get to Santiago, actually,

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.050
it can be something of an anticlimax,

00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:55.396
because there are 100,000
people living there

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.611
who are not necessarily applauding you
as you're coming into town.

00:03:58.635 --> 00:03:59.636
(Laughter)

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.987
And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you
a memento of your journey.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:10.126
But you do have the possibility
of going on for three more days

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.545
to this place where Marlene stood,
called, in Spanish, Finisterre,

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.546
in English, Finisterre,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.987
from the Latin,
meaning "the ends of the earth,"

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.058
the place where ground turns to ocean;

00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:29.467
the place where your present
turns into the future.

00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:32.076
And Marlene had walked this way --

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.794
she just graduated as a 23-year-old
from the University of Sligo

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:38.195
with a degree in Irish drama.

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.611
And she said to me, "I don't think
the major corporations of the world

00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:43.040
will be knocking on my door."

00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:46.136
I said, "Listen, I've worked
in corporations all over the world

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.313
for decades;

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:51.064
a degree in drama is what would most
prepare you for the adult --

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:52.105
(Laughter)

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.284
corporate world."

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:54.848
(Applause)

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.931
But she said, "I'm not
interested in that, anyway.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:01.578
I don't want to teach drama,
I want to become a dramatist.

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.234
I want to write plays.

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:08.443
So I walked the Camino
in order to give myself some courage,

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.646
in order to walk into my future."

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.316
And I said, "What was the most powerful
moment you had on the whole Camino,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.884
the very most powerful moment?"

00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:17.816
She said, "I had many powerful moments,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.860
but you know, the most powerful
moment was post-Camino,

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:26.136
was the three days you go on from Santiago
and come to this cliff edge.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.776
And you go through three rituals.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.421
The first ritual is to eat
a tapas plate of scallops" --

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:34.010
or if you're vegetarian,

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.487
to contemplate the scallop shell.

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:37.962
(Laughter)

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:42.274
Because the scallop shell has been
the icon and badge of your walk,

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:45.075
and every arrow
that you have seen along that way

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.164
has been pointing underneath
a scallop shell.

00:05:49.188 --> 00:05:51.273
So really, this first ritual is saying:

00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:53.205
How did you get to this place?

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.065
How did you follow the path to get here?

00:05:56.783 --> 00:06:01.905
How do you hold the conversation of life
when you feel unbesieged,

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.087
when you're unbullied,

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.519
when you're left to yourself?

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:09.456
How do you hold the conversation of life
that brings you to this place?

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:14.449
And the second ritual is that you burn
something that you've brought.

00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:17.430
I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:19.894
She said, "I burned a letter
and two postcards."

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.632
I said, "Astonishing.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.700
Twenty-three years old and you have paper.

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:24.900
I can't believe it."

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:26.234
(Laughter)

00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:27.909
I'm sure there's a Camino app

00:06:27.933 --> 00:06:32.341
where you can just delete
a traumatic text, you know?

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:33.897
(Laughter)

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:35.937
It will engage the flashlight,

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.593
imbue it with color

00:06:37.617 --> 00:06:40.761
and disappear in a firework of flames.

00:06:41.977 --> 00:06:45.160
But you either bring a letter
or you write one there,

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:46.357
and you burn it.

00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:50.725
And of course we know intuitively
what is on those letters and postcards.

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:56.441
It's a form of affection and love
that is now no longer extant, yeah?

00:06:58.254 --> 00:06:59.813
And then the third ritual:

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:05.451
between all these fires
are large piles of clothes.

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.678
And you leave an item of clothing

00:07:08.702 --> 00:07:11.090
that has helped you to get to this place.

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.963
And I said to Marlene,
"What did you leave at the cliff edge?"

00:07:14.987 --> 00:07:16.412
She said, "I left my boots --

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.587
the very things
that I walked in, actually.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.086
They were beautiful boots,
I loved those boots,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.096
but they were finished
after seven weeks of walking.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.645
So I walked away in my trainers,

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:26.956
but I left my boots there."

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.861
She said, "It was really incredible.

00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:33.269
The most powerful moment was,
the sun was going down,

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:35.999
but the full moon was coming up behind me.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.426
And the full moon was illuminated
by the dying sun in such a powerful way

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.128
that even after the sun
had dropped below the horizon,

00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.391
the moon could still see that sun.

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:50.984
And I had a moon shadow,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:57.028
and I was looking at my moon shadow
walking across the Atlantic,

00:07:57.052 --> 00:07:58.839
across this ocean.

00:07:59.434 --> 00:08:00.585
And I thought,

00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.205
'Oh! That's my new self
going into the future.'

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:09.214
But suddenly I realized
the sun was falling further.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:13.359
The moon was losing its reflection,

00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:15.647
and my shadow was disappearing.

00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:18.783
The most powerful moment
I had on the whole Camino

00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:24.795
was when I realized I myself
had to walk across that unknown sea

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:26.226
into my future."

00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.473
Well, I was so taken by this story,

00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:30.822
I wrote this piece for her.

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:32.351
We were driving at the time;

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:34.048
we got home, I sat on the couch,

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:35.849
I wrote until two in the morning --

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:37.267
everyone had gone to bed --

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:40.138
and I gave it to Marlene
at breakfast time.

00:08:40.162 --> 00:08:43.333
It's called, "Finisterre,"
for Marlene McCormack.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:47.548
"The road in the end

00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:52.304
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:56.019
the road in the end
taking the path the run had taken

00:08:56.043 --> 00:08:58.437
into the western sea

00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:01.426
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.308
into the western sea

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.499
and the moon

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:06.809
the moon rising behind you

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:11.191
as you stood where ground turned to ocean:

00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.123
no way to your future now

00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:14.339
no way to your future now

00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:17.126
except the way your shadow could take,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.463
walking before you across water,
going where shadows go,

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:25.313
no way to make sense of a world
that wouldn't let you pass

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:29.052
except to call an end
to the way you had come,

00:09:30.262 --> 00:09:35.381
to take out each letter you had brought

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:37.870
and light their illumined corners;

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:42.978
and to read them as they drifted
on the late western light;

00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.207
to empty your bags

00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:45.784
to empty your bags;

00:09:45.808 --> 00:09:48.537
to sort this and to leave that

00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:50.902
to sort this and to leave that;

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:56.165
to promise what you needed
to promise all along

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:59.025
to promise what you needed
to promise all along,

00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:03.733
and to abandon the shoes
that brought you here

00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:05.606
right at the water's edge,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.191
not because you had given up

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:08.836
not because you had given up

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.701
but because now,

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:12.908
you would find a different way to tread,

00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:14.675
and because, through it all,

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.100
part of you would still walk on,

00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:18.608
no matter how,

00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:20.184
over the waves."

00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.766
"Finisterre."

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.144
For Marlene McCormack --

00:10:25.168 --> 00:10:31.509
(Applause)

00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:37.657
who has already had
her third play performed

00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:40.796
in off-off-off-off-Broadway --

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.985
in Dublin.

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.022
(Laughter)

00:10:43.046 --> 00:10:44.420
But she's on her way.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.185
This is the last piece.

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:53.331
This is about the supposed arrival
at the sum of all of our endeavors.

00:10:53.742 --> 00:10:55.154
In Santiago itself --

00:10:55.178 --> 00:10:56.416
it could be Santiago,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.745
it could be Mecca,

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:58.937
it could be Varanasi,

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:00.523
it could be Kyoto,

00:11:00.547 --> 00:11:04.814
it could be that threshold
you've set for yourself,

00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:12.168
the disturbing approach
to the consummation of all your goals.

00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:17.501
And one of the difficulties
about walking into your life,

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:18.958
about coming into this body,

00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:21.353
into this world fully,

00:11:21.877 --> 00:11:23.818
is you start to realize

00:11:23.842 --> 00:11:30.149
that you have manufactured
three abiding illusions

00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:34.195
that the rest of humanity has shared
with you since the beginning of time.

00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:39.027
And the first illusion
is that you can somehow construct a life

00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:41.234
in which you are not vulnerable.

00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:47.291
You can somehow be immune
to all of the difficulties

00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:51.499
and ill health and losses

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:55.871
that humanity has been subject to
since the beginning of time.

00:11:55.895 --> 00:11:57.611
If we look out at the natural world,

00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:59.139
there's no part of that world

00:11:59.163 --> 00:12:03.115
that doesn't go through cycles
of, first, incipience,

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.341
or hiddenness,

00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:06.794
but then growth, fullness,

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:11.055
but then a beautiful,
to begin with, disappearance,

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:14.102
and then a very austere,
full disappearance.

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:16.233
We look at that, we say,
"That's beautiful,

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:20.530
but can I just have the first half
of the equation, please?

00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:22.549
And when the disappearance is happening,

00:12:22.573 --> 00:12:25.625
I'll close my eyes and wait
for the new cycle to come around."

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:29.641
Which means most human beings
are at war with reality

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.473
50 percent of the time.

00:12:32.624 --> 00:12:37.421
The mature identity

00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:40.679
is able to live in the full cycle.

00:12:40.703 --> 00:12:42.356
The second illusion is,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.907
I can construct a life
in which I will not have my heart broken.

00:12:46.922 --> 00:12:49.570
Romance is the first place
we start to do it.

00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:53.018
When you're at the beginning
of a new romance or a new marriage,

00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:57.181
you say, "I have found the person
who will not break my heart."

00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:58.970
I'm sorry;

00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:04.392
you have chosen them out unconsciously
for that exact core competency.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:05.726
(Laughter)

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.087
They will break your heart.

00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:08.267
Why?

00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:09.901
Because you care about them.

00:13:09.925 --> 00:13:12.091
You look at parenting, yeah?

00:13:12.115 --> 00:13:15.243
Parenting: "I will be
the perfect mother and father."

00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:18.182
Your children will break your heart.

00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:21.960
And they don't even have to do
anything spectacular or dramatic.

00:13:22.897 --> 00:13:26.806
But usually, they do do something
spectacular or dramatic --

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.851
(Laughter)

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.153
to break your heart.

00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:33.291
And then they live with you
as spies and saboteurs for years,

00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:36.153
watching your every psychological move,

00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:38.875
and spotting your every weakness.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.065
And one day,

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:42.217
when they're about 14 years old,

00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:43.711
with your back turned to them,

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:44.979
in the kitchen,

00:13:45.003 --> 00:13:47.166
while you're making something for them --

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.198
(Laughter)

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:50.729
the psychological stiletto goes in.

00:13:50.753 --> 00:13:53.788
(Laughter)

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:57.093
(Applause)

00:13:58.502 --> 00:14:02.572
And you say, "How did you know
exactly where to place it?"

00:14:02.596 --> 00:14:03.611
(Laughter)

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:04.794
And they say,

00:14:04.818 --> 00:14:06.343
"I've been watching you for --

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:07.378
(Laughter)

00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:08.748
a good few years."

00:14:11.487 --> 00:14:16.892
And then we hope that our armored,
professional personalities

00:14:16.916 --> 00:14:20.052
will prevent us from having our
heart broken in work.

00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:23.090
But if you're sincere about your work,

00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:25.407
it should break your heart.

00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:27.781
You should get to thresholds

00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:31.324
where you do not know how to proceed.

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:35.208
You do not know how to get
from here to there.

00:14:36.619 --> 00:14:37.783
What does that do?

00:14:37.807 --> 00:14:41.059
It puts you into a proper
relationship with reality.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:42.233
Why?

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.084
Because you have to ask for help.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.167
Heartbreak.

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.303
We don't have a choice about heartbreak,

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:58.302
we only have a choice
of having our hearts broken

00:14:58.326 --> 00:15:03.756
over people and things and projects
that we deeply care about.

00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:07.292
And the last illusion is,

00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:11.753
I can somehow plan enough
and arrange things

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:15.392
that I will be able to see
the path to the end

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.090
right from where I'm standing,

00:15:17.114 --> 00:15:18.748
right to the horizon.

00:15:20.041 --> 00:15:21.844
But when you think about it,

00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:25.267
the only environment
in which that would be true

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.734
would be a flat desert,

00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:31.279
empty of any other life.

00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:34.478
But even in a flat desert,

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:37.780
the curvature of the earth
would take the path away from you.

00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:40.138
So, no;

00:15:40.162 --> 00:15:41.777
you see the path,

00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:43.683
and then you don't

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:45.642
and then you see it again.

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.786
So this is "Santiago,"

00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:50.597
the supposed arrival,

00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:54.980
which is a kind of return
to the beginning all at the same time.

00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:57.954
We have this experience of the journey,

00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:00.684
which is in all of our great
spiritual traditions,

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:01.861
of pilgrimage.

00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:06.155
But just by actually standing
in the ground of your life fully,

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:10.269
not trying to abstract yourself
into a strategic future

00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:13.950
that's actually just an escape
from present heartbreak;

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.783
the ability to stand
in the ground of your life

00:16:16.807 --> 00:16:20.196
and to look at the horizon
that is pulling you --

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.538
in that moment,

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:23.040
you are the whole journey.

00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:25.419
You are the whole conversation.

00:16:27.563 --> 00:16:28.713
"Santiago."

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:31.719
"The road seen, then not seen

00:16:31.743 --> 00:16:35.078
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.574
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:43.348
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:48.448
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take,

00:16:48.472 --> 00:16:52.122
the road dropping away from you

00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:56.896
as if leaving you to walk on thin air,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.095
then catching you,

00:16:58.119 --> 00:16:59.359
catching you,

00:16:59.383 --> 00:17:02.208
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:17:02.232 --> 00:17:03.395
catching you,

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:05.755
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:07.325
and the way forward

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.956
the way forward always in the end

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.517
the way that you came,

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.418
the way forward always in the end

00:17:14.442 --> 00:17:15.598
the way that you came,

00:17:15.622 --> 00:17:18.956
the way that you followed,
the way that carried you into your future,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.700
that brought you to this place,

00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:23.187
that brought you to this place,

00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:28.469
no matter that it sometimes
had to take your promise from you,

00:17:28.493 --> 00:17:33.808
no matter that it always
had to break your heart along the way:

00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:35.698
the sense

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:40.321
the sense of having walked
from deep inside yourself

00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:42.507
out into the revelation,

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:45.044
to have risked yourself

00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:51.038
for something that seemed to stand
both inside you and far beyond you,

00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:53.559
and that called you back in the end

00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:56.223
to the only road you could follow,

00:17:56.247 --> 00:18:00.600
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:18:00.624 --> 00:18:03.516
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:10.461
and speaking in the voice that by night
became a prayer for safe arrival,

00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:12.212
so that one day

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:14.353
one day you realized

00:18:14.377 --> 00:18:17.860
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:19.836
one day you realized

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.217
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:22.241 --> 00:18:23.392
and long ago

00:18:23.416 --> 00:18:27.393
and in the dwelling place
in which you lived before you began,

00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:28.573
and that

00:18:28.597 --> 00:18:31.213
and that every step along the way,

00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:32.884
every step along the way,

00:18:32.908 --> 00:18:36.735
you had carried the heart
and the mind and the promise

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:39.646
that first set you off
and then drew you on,

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.833
and that

00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:45.730
and that you were more marvelous

00:18:45.754 --> 00:18:48.018
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:52.019
you were more marvelous
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:56.280
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach

00:18:56.304 --> 00:19:00.041
you were more marvelous
in that simple wish to find a way

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.971
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach:

00:19:02.995 --> 00:19:04.172
as if, all along,

00:19:04.196 --> 00:19:07.289
you had thought the end point
might be a city with golden domes,

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.768
and cheering crowds,

00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.739
and turning the corner

00:19:10.763 --> 00:19:15.110
at what you thought
was the end of the road,

00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:18.247
you found just a simple reflection,

00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:22.792
and a clear revelation
beneath the face looking back

00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:27.144
and beneath it another invitation,

00:19:27.168 --> 00:19:29.567
all in one glimpse

00:19:29.591 --> 00:19:31.238
all in one glimpse:

00:19:31.262 --> 00:19:32.492
like a person

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:36.966
like a person or a place
you had sought forever

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.477
like a person or a place
you had sought forever,

00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:44.828
like a bold field of freedom
that beckoned you beyond;

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:46.209
like another life

00:19:46.233 --> 00:19:48.018
like another life,

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.309
and the road

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.625
the road still stretching on."

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.363
(Applause)

00:19:55.387 --> 00:19:56.541
Thank you.

00:19:56.565 --> 00:19:59.642
(Applause)

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.350
Thank you.

00:20:02.374 --> 00:20:05.374
(Applause)
