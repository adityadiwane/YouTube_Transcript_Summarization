00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:16.473
There's something that I'd like you to see.

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:18.957
(Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:21.011
millions in China:

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.891
footage of a two-year-old girl

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.443
hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,

00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:30.683
footage too graphic to be shown.

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:33.363
The entire accident is caught on camera.

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:36.171
The driver pauses after hitting the child,

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.083
his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:44.028
Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.

00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:47.712
The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:51.035
Others look at her before moving off.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.807
Peter Singer: There were other people

00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:57.134
who walked past Wang Yue,

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:58.853
and a second van ran over her legs

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:02.069
before a street cleaner raised the alarm.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.270
She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.078
I wonder how many of you, looking at that,

00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:14.761
said to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that.

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.965
I would have stopped to help."

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.865
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:23.741
As I thought, that's most of you.

00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:25.708
And I believe you. I'm sure you're right.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:28.947
But before you give yourself too much credit,

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:30.609
look at this.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.785
UNICEF reports that in 2011,

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:38.734
6.9 million children under five

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:44.186
died from preventable, poverty-related diseases.

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.448
UNICEF thinks that that's good news

00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:49.626
because the figure has been steadily coming down

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:53.679
from 12 million in 1990. That is good.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.783
But still, 6.9 million

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:02.107
is 19,000 children dying every day.

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:04.893
Does it really matter

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:07.798
that we're not walking past them in the street?

00:02:07.798 --> 00:02:13.016
Does it really matter that they're far away?

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.434
I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:18.842
The fact that they're not right in front of us,

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.003
the fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.978
or race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.498
What is really important is,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:30.763
can we reduce that death toll? Can we save

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:35.729
some of those 19,000 children dying every day?

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.347
And the answer is, yes we can.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.890
Each of us spends money

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.071
on things that we do not really need.

00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:46.003
You can think what your own habit is,

00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.568
whether it's a new car, a vacation

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.248
or just something like buying bottled water

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:53.271
when the water that comes out of the tap

00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.801
is perfectly safe to drink.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.448
You could take the money you're spending

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.343
on those unnecessary things

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:01.709
and give it to this organization,

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.636
the Against Malaria Foundation,

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:07.208
which would take the money you had given

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.911
and use it to buy nets like this one

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:14.450
to protect children like this one,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.746
and we know reliably that if we provide nets,

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:22.148
they're used, and they reduce the number of children

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:24.604
dying from malaria,

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.412
just one of the many preventable diseases

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:31.364
that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children

00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:35.012
dying every day.

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.196
Fortunately, more and more people

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.710
are understanding this idea,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.028
and the result is a growing movement:

00:03:43.028 --> 00:03:45.684
effective altruism.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:50.068
It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:51.779
The heart, of course, you felt.

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.922
You felt the empathy for that child.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.956
But it's really important to use the head as well

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:03.749
to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.083
and not only that, but also I think reason helps us

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:11.852
to understand that other people, wherever they are,

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:15.443
are like us, that they can suffer as we can,

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:18.116
that parents grieve for the deaths of their children,

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.919
as we do,

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.137
and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,

00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:27.380
it matters just as much to all of these people.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.448
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool

00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:31.943
to help you get whatever you want.

00:04:31.943 --> 00:04:36.573
It does help us to put perspective on our situation.

00:04:36.573 --> 00:04:38.452
And I think that's why

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:43.458
many of the most significant people in effective altruism

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:45.842
have been people who have had backgrounds

00:04:45.842 --> 00:04:50.580
in philosophy or economics or math.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.045
And that might seem surprising,

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:53.378
because a lot of people think,

00:04:53.378 --> 00:04:57.191
"Philosophy is remote from the real world;

00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.134
economics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.665
and we know that math is for nerds."

00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:07.423
But in fact it does make a difference,

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.359
and in fact there's one particular nerd

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:13.579
who has been a particularly effective altruist

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.496
because he got this.

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:18.775
This is the website of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:22.571
and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,

00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.498
it says, "All lives have equal value."

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.367
That's the understanding,

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:31.989
the rational understanding of our situation in the world

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:34.250
that has led to these people

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.931
being the most effective altruists in history,

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:41.603
Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:47.736
(Applause)

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:51.905
No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:54.563
has ever given as much to charity

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:57.811
as each one of these three,

00:05:57.811 --> 00:06:00.563
and they have used their intelligence

00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:04.643
to make sure that it is highly effective.

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:07.731
According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.539
has already saved 5.8 million lives

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.697
and many millions more, people, getting diseases

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:16.224
that would have made them very sick,

00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:19.475
even if eventually they survived.

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:22.075
Over the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation

00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:24.739
is going to give a lot more,

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:28.714
is going to save a lot more lives.

00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:32.956
Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:35.380
you can have that kind of impact.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.328
But if I'm not, what can I do?

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:41.652
So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:45.100
that maybe stand in the way of them giving.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.467
They worry how much of a difference they can make.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:50.692
But you don't have to be a billionaire.

00:06:50.692 --> 00:06:54.356
This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:56.382
at the University of Oxford.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.970
He became an effective altruist when he calculated

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.245
that with the money that he was likely to earn

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:04.645
throughout his career, an academic career,

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:11.312
he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness

00:07:11.312 --> 00:07:13.358
in developing countries

00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:15.631
and still have enough left

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:20.355
for a perfectly adequate standard of living.

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:22.352
So Toby founded an organization

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:26.438
called Giving What We Can to spread this information,

00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:30.364
to unite people who want to share some of their income,

00:07:30.364 --> 00:07:33.077
and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:35.188
of what they earn over their lifetime

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:38.509
to fighting global poverty.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.948
Toby himself does better than that.

00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:45.348
He's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year --

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:48.092
that's less than 30,000 dollars --

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:51.492
and to give the rest to those organizations.

00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:57.066
And yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage.

00:07:57.066 --> 00:08:00.711
This is a couple at a later stage of life,

00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:03.707
Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott,

00:08:03.707 --> 00:08:05.234
who, when they were young, when they met,

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.388
were activists against the Vietnam War,

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.367
fought for social justice,

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.251
and then moved into careers, as most people do,

00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.860
didn't really do anything very active about those values,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.699
although they didn't abandon them.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.078
And then, as they got to the age at which many people

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:25.484
start to think of retirement, they returned to them,

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:28.648
and they've decided to cut back on their spending,

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:33.793
to live modestly, and to give both money and time

00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:38.671
to helping to fight global poverty.

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:41.713
Now, mentioning time might lead you to think,

00:08:41.713 --> 00:08:45.337
"Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:48.542
into saving some of these 19,000 lives

00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:50.205
that are lost every day?"

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:52.907
One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.730
of how you can have a career that will have

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.451
the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.107
He's a graduate student in philosophy,

00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:06.459
and he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:08.133
the number of hours he estimates

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:10.505
most people spend on their career,

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:12.717
to advise people on how to have the best,

00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:14.697
most effective career.

00:09:14.697 --> 00:09:16.911
But you might be surprised to know

00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.932
that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,

00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:22.197
if they have the right abilities and character,

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:26.864
is to go into banking or finance.

00:09:26.864 --> 00:09:30.675
Why? Because if you earn a lot of money,

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:33.014
you can give away a lot of money,

00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:35.060
and if you're successful in that career,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.674
you could give enough to an aid organization

00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:42.604
so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers

00:09:42.604 --> 00:09:45.896
in developing countries, and each one of them

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:47.740
would probably do about as much good

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.274
as you would have done.

00:09:49.274 --> 00:09:52.284
So you can quintuple the impact

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:56.405
by leading that kind of career.

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:58.925
Here's one young man who's taken this advice.

00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:00.266
His name is Matt Weiger.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.028
He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,

00:10:04.028 --> 00:10:07.747
actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis

00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:10.126
last year when he graduated.

00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:13.352
But he's gone into finance in New York.

00:10:13.352 --> 00:10:14.957
He's already earning enough

00:10:14.957 --> 00:10:19.223
so that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:22.952
and still leaving himself with enough to live on.

00:10:22.952 --> 00:10:26.823
Matt has also helped me to set up an organization

00:10:26.823 --> 00:10:29.876
that I'm working with that has the name taken

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.503
from the title of a book I wrote,

00:10:31.503 --> 00:10:33.401
"The Life You Can Save,"

00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:36.142
which is trying to change our culture

00:10:36.142 --> 00:10:39.875
so that more people think that

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.592
if we're going to live an ethical life,

00:10:41.592 --> 00:10:45.423
it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:47.803
and not cheat, steal, maim, kill,

00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:50.690
but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.043
with people who have so little.

00:10:54.043 --> 00:10:56.822
And the organization draws together people

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.506
of different generations,

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.351
like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,

00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:01.868
who's pledged to give 10 percent

00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:03.817
of the little amount that she has,

00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:05.870
and on the right, Ada Wan,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.597
who has worked directly for the poor, but has now

00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:13.099
gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.

00:11:13.099 --> 00:11:14.624
Many people will think, though,

00:11:14.624 --> 00:11:18.606
that charities aren't really all that effective.

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:20.399
So let's talk about effectiveness.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:22.389
Toby Ord is very concerned about this,

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:25.276
and he's calculated that some charities

00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:28.065
are hundreds or even thousands of times

00:11:28.065 --> 00:11:30.123
more effective than others,

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:32.959
so it's very important to find the effective ones.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:37.990
Take, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.802
That's a good thing to do, right?

00:11:40.802 --> 00:11:42.824
Well, right, it is a good thing to do,

00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:45.741
but you have to think what else you could do with the resources.

00:11:45.741 --> 00:11:49.985
It costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog

00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:52.481
and train the recipient so that the guide dog

00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:55.865
can be an effective help to a blind person.

00:11:55.865 --> 00:12:00.137
It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars

00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:03.143
to cure a blind person in a developing country

00:12:03.143 --> 00:12:05.153
if they have trachoma.

00:12:05.153 --> 00:12:08.224
So you do the sums, and you get something like that.

00:12:08.224 --> 00:12:09.970
You could provide one guide dog

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.315
for one blind American,

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.191
or you could cure between 400

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.962
and 2,000 people of blindness.

00:12:18.962 --> 00:12:22.559
I think it's clear what's the better thing to do.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.074
But if you want to look for effective charities,

00:12:26.074 --> 00:12:28.306
this is a good website to go to.

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:33.190
GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.155
not just whether they're well-run,

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.455
and it's screened hundreds of charities

00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:40.754
and currently is recommending only three,

00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:44.987
of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.

00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.610
So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.620
thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.986
both have a somewhat broader list,

00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:56.322
but you can find effective organizations,

00:12:56.322 --> 00:13:00.498
and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.

00:13:00.498 --> 00:13:03.074
I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:06.506
looking at effective animal organizations.

00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:08.510
That's another cause that I've been concerned about

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.114
all my life, the immense amount of suffering

00:13:11.114 --> 00:13:12.640
that humans inflict

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.897
on literally tens of billions of animals every year.

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:19.223
So if you want to look for effective organizations

00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:21.296
to reduce that suffering,

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:24.297
you can go to Effective Animal Activism.

00:13:24.297 --> 00:13:27.336
And some effective altruists think it's very important

00:13:27.336 --> 00:13:31.093
to make sure that our species survives at all.

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:34.523
So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.

00:13:34.523 --> 00:13:37.166
Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:41.323
recently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.

00:13:41.323 --> 00:13:44.329
Possibly research could help us not only to predict

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:46.300
the path of asteroids that might collide with us,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.092
but actually to deflect them.

00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:51.756
So some people think that would be a good thing to give to.

00:13:51.756 --> 00:13:53.998
There's many possibilities.

00:13:53.998 --> 00:13:55.709
My final question is,

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:58.740
some people will think it's a burden to give.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.373
I don't really believe it is.

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.553
I've enjoyed giving all of my life

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:03.871
since I was a graduate student.

00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:06.704
It's been something fulfilling to me.

00:14:06.704 --> 00:14:09.135
Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.

00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:12.509
He thinks that the life he's saving is his own.

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:16.436
And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression

00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:18.668
until she got involved with effective altruism,

00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:22.214
and now is one of the happiest people she knows.

00:14:22.214 --> 00:14:23.987
I think one of the reasons for this

00:14:23.987 --> 00:14:27.254
is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:30.125
what I call the Sisyphus problem.

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:33.318
Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,

00:14:33.318 --> 00:14:36.341
condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder

00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:38.020
up to the top of the hill.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.070
Just as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.311
the boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,

00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:47.615
he has to trudge back down to push it up again,

00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:50.034
and the same thing happens again and again

00:14:50.034 --> 00:14:52.416
for all eternity.

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:55.431
Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,

00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:58.113
where you work hard to get money,

00:14:58.113 --> 00:15:00.358
you spend that money on consumer goods

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.930
which you hope you'll enjoy using?

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.661
But then the money's gone, you have to work hard

00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:09.561
to get more, spend more, and to maintain

00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.568
the same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.

00:15:12.568 --> 00:15:15.934
You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.

00:15:15.934 --> 00:15:18.926
Becoming an effective altruist gives you

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:20.416
that meaning and fulfillment.

00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:24.607
It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem

00:15:24.607 --> 00:15:28.732
on which you can feel your life was really worth living.

00:15:28.732 --> 00:15:31.288
I'm going to conclude by telling you

00:15:31.288 --> 00:15:33.421
about an email that I received

00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:38.345
while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.

00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:41.372
It's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.

00:15:41.372 --> 00:15:45.791
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:48.325
Why was he recovering from surgery?

00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:51.882
The email began, "Last Tuesday,

00:15:51.882 --> 00:15:55.740
I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.825
That started a kidney chain

00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:02.494
which enabled four people to receive kidneys."

00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:04.933
There's about 100 people each year in the U.S.

00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:07.651
and more in other countries who do that.

00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:09.815
I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say

00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:13.187
that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.

00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:16.610
Well, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:22.872
because I still have two kidneys.

00:16:22.872 --> 00:16:25.138
But Chris went on to say that he didn't think

00:16:25.138 --> 00:16:27.818
that what he'd done was all that amazing,

00:16:27.818 --> 00:16:31.325
because he calculated that the number of life-years

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.873
that he had added to people, the extension of life,

00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:36.682
was about the same that you could achieve

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:42.518
if you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:46.594
And that did make me feel a little bit better,

00:16:46.594 --> 00:16:50.148
because I have given more than 5,000 dollars

00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:52.995
to the Against Malaria Foundation

00:16:52.995 --> 00:16:57.898
and to various other effective charities.

00:16:57.898 --> 00:16:59.332
So if you're feeling bad

00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:03.414
because you still have two kidneys as well,

00:17:03.414 --> 00:17:06.048
there's a way for you to get off the hook.

00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:07.248
Thank you.

00:17:07.248 --> 00:17:13.402
(Applause)
