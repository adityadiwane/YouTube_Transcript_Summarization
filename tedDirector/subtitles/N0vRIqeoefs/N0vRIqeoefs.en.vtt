00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.399
Why do we think

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:19.714
that stories by men are deemed
to be of universal importance,

00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:24.593
and stories by women are thought
to be merely about women?

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.372
My grandmother left school
when she was 12.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.067
She had 14 children.

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:34.067
My mother left school when she was 15.

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:35.492
She was a secretary.

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:39.274
I graduated from university
to become a theater director,

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:43.457
and that progress is entirely to do
with the fact that people I'll never meet

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.729
fought for women to have rights,

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:48.894
get the vote, get education,
have progress.

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:52.503
And I'm determined to do the same,
and obviously you are, too.

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:53.704
Why not?

00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:55.285
(Applause)

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.021
So I started a festival called WOW,
Women of the World, seven years ago,

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.049
and it's now in 20 countries
across five continents.

00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:05.424
And one of those countries
is Somaliland in Africa.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:07.663
So I traveled there last year,

00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:13.280
and part of the joy I had in going there
was going to these caves.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.718
The Laas Geel caves.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:22.256
Now, these caves contain some
of the oldest cave paintings in the world.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.094
These paintings are thought to be
round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.359
Art:

00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:34.146
what humanity has done
ever since it evolved.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.293
It's how we speak about ourselves,

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:38.254
how we understand our identity,

00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:40.026
how we look at our surroundings,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.121
who we find out about each other

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.355
because of the meaning of our lives.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.703
That's what art is for.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.753
So look at this little picture.

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:51.723
I think it's a little girl.

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:54.523
I thought it was a bit like me
when I was a little girl.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:59.182
And I thought, well, who painted
this joyful, youthful figure?

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.310
And I asked the curator of the caves.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:04.852
I said, "Tell me about the men
and women who painted these."

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:08.353
And he looked at me
absolutely askance, and he said,

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:10.589
"Women didn't paint these pictures."

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.565
And I said, "Well,
it was 11,000 years ago."

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.048
I said, "How do you know?"

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.599
(Laughter)

00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:21.354
And he said, "Women don't do these things.

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:25.017
Men made these marks. Women don't."

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:30.137
Now, I wasn't really surprised,

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:34.219
because that's an attitude
that I've seen continuously

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:37.015
all my life as a theater maker.

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:44.182
We are told that divine knowledge
comes down through the masculine,

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:48.793
whether it be to the imam,
the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.

00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:54.537
Similarly, we're told that creative genius
resides in the masculine,

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.307
that it is the masculine

00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:59.396
that will be able to tell us
about who we really are,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.487
that the masculine will tell
the universal story

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:04.398
on behalf of all of us,

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:08.997
whereas women artists will really
just talk about women's experiences,

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.397
women's issues
only really relevant to women

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.399
and of passing interest to men --

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:17.325
and really only some men.

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.000
And it's that conviction,

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:21.405
that that we are taught,

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:25.229
that I think colors so much
of whether we're prepared to believe

00:03:25.253 --> 00:03:27.754
that women's stories really matter.

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:31.325
And unless we're prepared to believe
that women's stories really matter,

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.339
then women's rights don't really matter,

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:37.035
and then change can't really come.

00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:43.406
I want to tell you
about two examples of stories

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.368
that are thought to be
of universal importance:

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.148
"E.T." and "Hamlet."

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:52.283
(Laughter)

00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:55.573
So I took my two children
when they were little --

00:03:55.597 --> 00:03:58.847
Caroline was eight and Robby was five --

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.438
to see "E.T."

00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:03.847
And it's a fantastic story
of this little alien

00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:05.822
who ends up in an American family

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:09.055
with a mum, two brothers and a sister,

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.722
but he wants to go home.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.160
Not only that, but some
really bad scientists

00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:16.558
want to do some experiments on him,

00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:18.268
and they're looking for him.

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:20.869
So the children have a plot.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.730
They decide they're going to take him
back to his spaceship

00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:24.905
as soon as they can,

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:26.803
and they plop him in a bicycle basket,

00:04:26.827 --> 00:04:28.169
and off they ride.

00:04:28.193 --> 00:04:32.089
But unfortunately, the baddies
have found out, and they're catching up

00:04:32.113 --> 00:04:34.470
and they've got sirens
and they've got their guns,

00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:37.168
they've got the loud-hailers,
it's terribly frightening,

00:04:37.192 --> 00:04:39.112
and they're closing up on the children,

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:41.232
and the children are never
going to make it.

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:45.349
And then all of a sudden, magically,
the bikes fly up in the air,

00:04:45.373 --> 00:04:46.912
over the clouds,

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.124
over the moon,

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:50.439
and they're going to save "E.T."

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:53.492
So I turn to see my children's faces,

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:57.986
and Robby is enraptured,
he's there with them, he's saving E.T.,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.866
he's a happy boy.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.028
And I turn to Caroline,
and she's crying her eyes out.

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:05.231
And I said, "What's the matter?"

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:10.790
And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.?
Why can't I come?"

00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:13.601
And then all of a sudden I realized:

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.036
they weren't children;

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:16.940
they were boys --

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:19.640
all boys.

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:22.641
And Caroline, who had invested
so much in E.T.,

00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:24.835
well, she wasn't invited to save him,

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:27.536
and she felt humiliated and spurned.

00:05:28.232 --> 00:05:29.981
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:36.173
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:36.197 --> 00:05:38.747
and I said, "I don't know
if you understand

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.150
the psychological importance
of what's happened,

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.674
and are you prepared to pay
for the therapy bills?"

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:45.112
(Laughter)

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.108
Twenty years later, I haven't
had a word back from him,

00:05:48.132 --> 00:05:49.570
but I'm still hopeful.

00:05:49.594 --> 00:05:51.204
(Laughter)

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:52.832
But I thought it was interesting,

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:55.728
because if you read reviews
of what he intended with E.T.,

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:57.543
he says very specifically,

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.069
"I wanted the world to understand

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.300
that we should love
and embrace difference."

00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:07.946
But somehow he didn't include
the idea of girls' difference

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.662
in this thinking.

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:13.996
He thought he was writing a story
about all humanity.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.098
Caroline thought he was marginalizing

00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:17.551
half of humanity.

00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.659
He thought he was writing a story
about human goodness;

00:06:20.683 --> 00:06:25.069
she thought he was writing
a lad's heroic adventure.

00:06:25.848 --> 00:06:27.609
And this is common.

00:06:28.332 --> 00:06:33.453
Men feel they have been given the mantle
for universal communication,

00:06:33.477 --> 00:06:35.429
but of course, how could they be?

00:06:35.453 --> 00:06:39.533
They are writing from male experience
through male's eyes.

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.069
We have to have a look at this ourselves.

00:06:44.093 --> 00:06:47.769
We have to be prepared to go back
through all our books and our films,

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:49.130
all our favorite things,

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.984
and say, "Actually, this is written
by a male artist --

00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:53.996
not an artist.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.424
We have to see
that so many of these stories

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:58.584
are written through a male perspective.

00:06:58.608 --> 00:07:00.545
Which is fine,

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.067
but then females need to have
50 percent of the rights

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.645
for the stage, the film, the novel,

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.458
the place of creativity.

00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:11.180
Let me talk about "Hamlet."

00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:12.897
To be or not to be.

00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:14.135
That is the question.

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:16.083
But it's not my question.

00:07:16.607 --> 00:07:20.356
My question is: Why was I taught
as a young woman

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.737
that this was the quintessential
example of human dilemma

00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:26.457
and human experience?

00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.817
It's a marvelous story,

00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:33.177
but actually, it's about a young man
fearful that he won't be able to make it

00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:35.866
as a powerful figure in a male world

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.605
unless he takes revenge
for his father's murder.

00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:44.050
He talks a great deal to us
about suicide being an option,

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:48.743
but the reality is that the person
who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:51.265
after she's been humiliated
and abused by him,

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:54.465
never gets a chance to talk
to the audience about her feelings.

00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:57.431
And then when he's finished with Ophelia,
he turns on his mum,

00:07:57.455 --> 00:08:00.754
because basically she has the audacity
to fall in love with his uncle

00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:01.990
and enjoy sex.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:04.051
(Laughter)

00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:06.163
It is a great story,

00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:11.258
but it is a story about male conflict,
male dilemma, male struggle.

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:16.149
But I was told this was the story
of human beings,

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:19.216
despite the fact that it only
had two women in it.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.801
And unless I reeducate myself,

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.550
I am always going to think

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:27.315
that women's stories
matter less than men's.

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:29.721
A woman could have written "Hamlet,"

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:31.832
but she would have written it differently,

00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:34.464
and it wouldn't have had
global recognition.

00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:36.559
As the writer Margaret Atwood says,

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:39.069
"When a man writes about doing the dishes,

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:40.388
it's realism.

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:43.320
When a woman writes about doing it,

00:08:43.344 --> 00:08:45.859
it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."

00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:47.092
(Laughter)

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:50.950
Now, this is not just something
that belongs to then.

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:52.774
I mean, when I was a young girl,

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:55.422
wanting desperately
to be a theater director,

00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:58.285
this is what my male lecturer said to me:

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:02.381
"Well, there are three women
directors in Britain," he said, "Jude."

00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:06.512
"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,
there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,

00:09:06.536 --> 00:09:09.316
and there's Buzz Goodbody,
who's just killed herself.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.596
So, which of those three
would you like to be?"

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.673
(Laughter)

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:17.283
Now, leaving aside
the disgusting slur on gay women,

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:20.152
the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.935
He thought it was silly
that I wanted to be a director.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.930
And I told my friend Marin Alsop,
the conductor, and she said,

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:29.703
"Oh yes, well, my music teacher
said exactly the same.

00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:31.897
He said, 'Women don't conduct.'"

00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:35.247
But all these years later,
we've made our mark.

00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:37.501
You think, "Well, it'll be different now."

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.019
I'm afraid it's not different now.

00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:43.488
The current head
of the Paris Conservatoire

00:09:43.512 --> 00:09:46.939
said recently, "It takes
great physical strength

00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:48.444
to conduct a symphony,

00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:49.919
and women are too weak."

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:51.396
(Laughter)

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.359
The artist George Baselitz said,

00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:55.670
"Well, the fact is women can't paint.

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:57.540
Well -- they can't paint very well."

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.402
The writer V.S. Naipaul
said two years ago,

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:04.018
"I can read two paragraphs and know
immediately if it's written by a woman,

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.743
and I just stop reading,
because it's not worthy of me."

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:08.440
Audience: Whoa!

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.842
And it goes on.

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:14.805
We have to find a way

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.473
of stopping young girls and women

00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:20.338
feeling not only that
their story doesn't matter,

00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:23.572
but they're not allowed
to be the storyteller.

00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:28.064
Because once you feel
that you can't stand in the central space

00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:31.096
and speak on behalf of the world,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.195
you will feel that you can offer
your goods up to a small, select group.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:39.735
You will tend to do smaller work
on smaller stages,

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.792
your economic power will be less,

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:44.288
your reach of audiences will be less,

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:48.653
and your credit will be less as an artist.

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:54.632
And we do finally give artists
these incredible, prominent spaces

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:55.820
in the world,

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:57.583
because they are our storytellers.

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:00.736
Now, why should it matter to you
if you're not an artist?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.005
Supposing you're an accountant
or an entrepreneur or a medic

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:05.196
or a scientist:

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.822
Should you care about women artists?

00:11:07.846 --> 00:11:09.902
Absolutely, you must,

00:11:09.926 --> 00:11:13.338
because as you can see
from the cave paintings,

00:11:13.362 --> 00:11:15.043
all civilizations,

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:17.271
all of humanity

00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:21.881
have relied upon artists
to tell the human story,

00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:25.174
and if the human story
is finally told by men,

00:11:25.198 --> 00:11:26.934
take my word for it,

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.675
it will be about men.

00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:32.175
So let's make a change.

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:34.401
Let's make a change
to all our institutions,

00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:35.700
and not just in the West.

00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:40.143
Don't forget -- this message
of incapability of women

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.192
to hold creative genius

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:47.130
is being told to girls and women
in Nigeria, in China, in Russia,

00:11:47.154 --> 00:11:48.317
in Indonesia.

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.050
All over the world, girls
and women are being told

00:11:51.074 --> 00:11:55.991
that they can't finally hold the idea
of creative inspiration.

00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:58.600
And I want to ask you:

00:11:58.624 --> 00:12:00.338
Do you believe that?

00:12:00.362 --> 00:12:04.157
Do you believe that women
can be a creative genius?

00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:10.727
(Applause and cheers)

00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.412
Well then, please go forward,

00:12:12.436 --> 00:12:14.686
support women artists,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.184
buy their work,

00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:18.476
insist that their voices are heard,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.770
find platforms on which
their voices will be made.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.287
And remember this:

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:27.590
that in a sense, if we're going
to get past this moment

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:31.466
of a world where we know
that we are unequal,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.687
it's artists who have to imagine
a different world.

00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:38.321
And I'm calling on all artists,
women and men,

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:41.685
to imagine a gender-equal world.

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:44.329
Let's paint it. Let's draw it.

00:12:44.353 --> 00:12:46.148
Let's write about it. Let's film it.

00:12:46.172 --> 00:12:48.058
And if we could imagine it,

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:51.562
then we would have the energy
and the stamina

00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:53.075
to work towards it.

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:55.676
When I see this little girl,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.740
11,000 years ago,

00:12:57.764 --> 00:13:01.225
I want to know that the little girl now

00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:04.533
can stand there and think
she's entitled to her dreams,

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:06.847
she's entitled to her destiny

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:11.073
and she's entitled to speak
on behalf of the whole world,

00:13:11.097 --> 00:13:12.921
be recognized for it

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:14.595
and applauded.

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:15.805
Thank you.

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:20.610
(Applause)
