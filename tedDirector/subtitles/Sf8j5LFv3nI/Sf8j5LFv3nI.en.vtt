00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.916
Twenty years ago,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.876
when I was a barrister
and human rights lawyer

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.875
in full-time legal practice in London,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.076
and the highest court in the land

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.516
still convened, some would say
by an accident of history,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.860
in this building here,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.716
I met a young man
who had just quit his job

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.169
in the British Foreign Office.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.036
When I asked him, "Why did you leave,"

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.260
he told me this story.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.036
He had gone to his boss
one morning and said,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.180
"Let's do something
about human rights abuses in China."

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.996
And his boss had replied,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.716
"We can't do anything
about human rights abuses in China

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.340
because we have
trade relations with China."

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.076
So my friend went away
with his tail between his legs,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.260
and six months later,
he returned again to his boss,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.676
and he said this time,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.196
"Let's do something
about human rights in Burma,"

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.420
as it was then called.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.356
His boss once again paused

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.396
and said, "Oh, but we can't
do anything about human rights in Burma

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.076
because we don't have
any trade relations with Burma."

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.756
(Laughter)

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.876
This was the moment
he knew he had to leave.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.260
It wasn't just the hypocrisy
that got to him.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.236
It was the unwillingness of his government

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.876
to engage in conflict
with other governments,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.676
in tense discussions,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.500
all the while, innocent people
were being harmed.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.956
We are constantly told

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.060
that conflict is bad

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.780
that compromise is good;

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.116
that conflict is bad

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.260
but consensus is good;

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.156
that conflict is bad

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.740
and collaboration is good.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.156
But in my view,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.556
that's far too simple
a vision of the world.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.476
We cannot know

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.556
whether conflict is bad

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.396
unless we know who is fighting,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.556
why they are fighting

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.436
and how they are fighting.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.916
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.620
if they harm people
who are not at the table,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.835
people who are vulnerable, disempowered,

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.140
people whom we have
an obligation to protect.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.356
Now, you might be
somewhat skeptical of a lawyer

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.556
arguing about the benefits of conflict

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.196
and creating problems for compromise,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.036
but I did also qualify as a mediator,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.340
and these days, I spend my time
giving talks about ethics for free.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.060
So as my bank manager likes to remind me,
I'm downwardly mobile.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.116
But if you accept my argument,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.316
it should change not just the way
we lead our personal lives,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.660
which I wish to put
to one side for the moment,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.196
but it will change the way
we think about major problems

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.980
of public health and the environment.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.460
Let me explain.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.556
Every middle schooler
in the United States,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.236
my 12-year-old daughter included,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.116
learns that there are
three branches of government,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.980
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial branch.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.076
James Madison wrote,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.116
"If there is any principle
more sacred in our Constitution,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.876
and indeed in any free constitution,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.396
than any other,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.916
it is that which separates

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.060
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial powers."

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.156
Now, the framers were not just concerned

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.276
about the concentration
and exercise of power.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.300
They also understood
the perils of influence.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.356
Judges cannot determine
the constitutionality of laws

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.156
if they participate in making those laws,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.116
nor can they hold the other branches
of government accountable

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.076
if they collaborate with them

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.260
or enter into close
relationships with them.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.196
The Constitution is,
as one famous scholar put it,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.460
"an invitation to struggle."

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.836
And we the people are served

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.260
when those branches do, indeed,
struggle with each other.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.676
Now, we recognize
the importance of struggle

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.596
not just in the public sector

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.996
between our branches of government.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.356
We also know it too in the private sector,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.980
in relationships among corporations.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.196
Let's imagine that two American airlines
get together and agree

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.396
that they will not drop the price

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.780
of their economy class airfares
below 250 dollars a ticket.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.276
That is collaboration,
some would say collusion,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.636
not competition,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.476
and we the people are harmed

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.340
because we pay more for our tickets.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.916
Imagine similarly
two airlines were to say,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.956
"Look, Airline A, we'll take
the route from LA to Chicago,"

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.156
and Airline B says, "We'll take
the route from Chicago to DC,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.636
and we won't compete."

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.276
Once again, that's collaboration
or collusion instead of competition,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.020
and we the people are harmed.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.156
So we understand
the importance of struggle

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.420
when it comes to relationships
between branches of government,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.596
the public sector.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.036
We also understand
the importance of conflict

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.396
when it comes to relationships
among corporations,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.076
the private sector.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.676
But where we have forgotten it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.116
is in the relationships
between the public and the private.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.836
And governments all over the world
are collaborating with industry

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.636
to solve problems of public health
and the environment,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.636
often collaborating
with the very corporations

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.500
that are creating or exacerbating
the problems they are trying to solve.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.476
We are told that these relationships

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.180
are a win-win.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.340
But what if someone is losing out?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.420
Let me give you some examples.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.156
A United Nations agency
decided to address a serious problem:

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.780
poor sanitation in schools in rural India.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.076
They did so not just in collaboration
with national and local governments

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.596
but also with a television company

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.460
and with a major
multinational soda company.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.596
In exchange for less
than one million dollars,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.996
that corporation received the benefits
of a months-long promotional campaign

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.196
including a 12-hour telethon

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.420
all using the company's logo
and color scheme.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.380
This was an arrangement

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.836
which was totally understandable

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.796
from the corporation's point of view.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.356
It enhances the reputation of the company

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.900
and it creates brand loyalty
for its products.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.796
But in my view,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.516
this is profoundly problematic
for the intergovernmental agency,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.700
an agency that has a mission
to promote sustainable living.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.836
By increasing consumption
of sugar-sweetened beverages

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.156
made from scarce local water supplies
and drunk out of plastic bottles

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.196
in a country that is already
grappling with obesity,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.636
this is neither sustainable
from a public health

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.556
nor an environmental point of view.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.916
And in order to solve
one public health problem,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.236
the agency is sowing the seeds

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.460
of another.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.596
This is just one example
of dozens I discovered

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.716
in researching a book on the relationships
between government and industry.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.516
I could also have told you
about the initiatives in parks

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.156
in London and throughout Britain,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.580
involving the same company,
promoting exercise,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.236
or indeed of the British government
creating voluntary pledges

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.436
in partnership with industry

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.196
instead of regulating industry.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.876
These collaborations or partnerships
have become the paradigm in public health,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.956
and once again, they make sense
from the point of view of industry.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.596
It allows them to frame
public health problems and their solutions

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.756
in ways that are least threatening to,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.636
most consonant with
their commercial interests.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.236
So obesity becomes a problem

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.516
of individual decision-making,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.595
of personal behavior,

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:47.796
personal responsibility
and lack of physical activity.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.916
It is not a problem,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.355
when framed this way,

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:54.996
of a multinational food system
involving major corporations.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.676
And again, I don't blame industry.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.116
Industry naturally engages
in strategies of influence

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.620
to promote its commercial interests.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.636
But governments have a responsibility

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.716
to develop counterstrategies

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.556
to protect us

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.260
and the common good.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.540
The mistake that governments are making

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.876
when they collaborate in this way

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.236
with industry

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.836
is that they conflate

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.676
the common good

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.900
with common ground.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.676
When you collaborate with industry,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.516
you necessarily put off the table

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.116
things that might promote the common good
to which industry will not agree.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.916
Industry will not agree
to increased regulation

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.116
unless it believes this will
stave off even more regulation

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.380
or perhaps knock some competitors
out of the market.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.076
Nor can companies agree
to do certain things,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.076
for example raise the prices
of their unhealthy products,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.236
because that would violate
competition law,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.460
as we've established.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.596
So our governments should not confound

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.076
the common good and common ground,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.340
especially when common ground
means reaching agreement with industry.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.036
I want to give you another example,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.196
moving from high-profile collaboration

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.716
to something that is below ground

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.996
both literally and figuratively:

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.620
the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.836
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.076
not knowing the mineral rights
have been sold.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.900
This is before the fracking boom.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.196
You build your dream home on that plot,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.836
and shortly afterwards,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:44.260
you discover that a gas company
is building a well pad on your land.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.260
That was the plight
of the Hallowich family.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.836
Within a very short period of time,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.076
they began to complain of headaches,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.316
of sore throats, of itchy eyes,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.156
in addition to the interference
of the noise, vibration

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.316
and the bright lights
from the flaring of natural gas.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.660
They were very vocal in their criticisms,

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.140
and then they fell silent.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.476
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
where this image appeared,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.356
and one other newspaper,
we discovered why they fell silent.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.076
The newspapers went to the court and said,
"What happened to the Hallowiches?"

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.476
And it turned out the Hallowiches
had made a secret settlement

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.396
with the gas operators, and it was
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.676
The gas company said,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.116
you can have a six-figure sum

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.276
to move elsewhere
and start your lives again,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.516
but in return

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.396
you must promise not to speak
of your experience with our company,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.996
not to speak of your
experience with fracking,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.740
not to speak about the health consequences

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.420
that might have been revealed
by a medical examination.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.356
Now, I do not blame
the Hallowiches for accepting

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.196
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.436
and starting their lives elsewhere.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.676
And one can understand

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.676
why the company would wish
to silence a squeaky wheel.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.476
What I want to point the finger at
is the legal and regulatory system,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.956
a system in which there are
networks of agreements

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.876
just like this one

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.460
which serve to silence people
and seal off data points

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.036
from public health experts
and epidemiologists,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.676
a system in which regulators

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.836
will even refrain
from issuing a violation notice

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.236
in the event of pollution

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.396
if the landowner and the gas company

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.996
agree to settle.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.956
This is a system which isn't just
bad from a public health point of view;

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.276
it exposes hazards to local families

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.500
who remain in the dark.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.516
Now, I have given you two examples
not because they are isolated examples.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.036
They are examples of a systemic problem.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.436
I could share some counterexamples,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.436
the case for example
of the public official

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.556
who sues the pharmaceutical company

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.196
for concealing the fact

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.796
that its antidepressant increases
suicidal thoughts in adolescents.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.716
I can tell you about the regulator
who went after the food company

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.476
for exaggerating the purported
health benefits of its yogurt.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.956
And I can tell you about the legislator

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.276
who despite heavy lobbying
directed at both sides of the aisle

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.220
pushes for environmental protections.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.716
These are isolated examples,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.916
but they are beacons of light
in the darkness,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.620
and they can show us the way.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.100
I began by suggesting that sometimes
we need to engage in conflict.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.836
Governments should tussle with,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.660
struggle with, at times engage
in direct conflict with corporations.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.036
This is not because governments
are inherently good

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.316
and corporations are inherently evil.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.340
Each is capable of good or ill.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.980
But corporations understandably
act to promote their commercial interests,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.956
and they do so either sometimes
undermining or promoting the common good.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.956
But it is the responsibility
of governments

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.196
to protect and promote the common good.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.916
And we should insist

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.340
that they fight to do so.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.116
This is because governments

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.540
are the guardians

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.620
of public health;

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.476
governments are the guardians

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.356
of the environment;

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.196
and it is governments

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.516
that are guardians

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.900
of these essential parts
of our common good.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.716
Thank you.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:54.968
(Applause)
