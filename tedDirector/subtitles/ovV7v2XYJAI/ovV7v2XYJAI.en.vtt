00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Today I want to talk about design,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
but not design as we usually think about it.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I want to talk about what is happening now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
in our scientific, biotechnological culture,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
where, for really the first time in history,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
we have the power to design bodies,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to design animal bodies,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
to design human bodies.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
In the history of our planet,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
there have been three great waves of evolution.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
The first wave of evolution

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So, as you all know,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
species lived in particular ecological niches

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and particular environments,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and the pressures of those environments

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
selected which changes,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
through random mutation in species,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
were going to be preserved.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Then human beings stepped out

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and created the second great wave of evolution,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
which was we changed the environment

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
in which we evolved.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
We altered our ecological niche

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
by creating civilization.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And that has been the second great --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
flow of our evolution.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
By changing our environment,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
we put new pressures

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
on our bodies to evolve.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
all the way through modern medicine,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
we have changed our own evolution.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Now we're entering a third great wave

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
of evolutionary history,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
which has been called many things:

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
"intentional evolution,"

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
"evolution by design" --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
very different than intelligent design --

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
whereby we are actually now

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
intentionally designing and altering

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and then at the end talk a little bit

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
about what some of the implications are for us

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and for our species, as well as our cultures,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
because of this change.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
We started selectively breeding animals

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
many, many thousands of years ago.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And if you think of dogs for example,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Dogs are the result

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of selectively breeding traits that we like.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
by choosing offspring that looked a particular way

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and then breeding them.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We don't have to do it that way anymore.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
This is a beefalo.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And they are now making them,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and someday, perhaps pretty soon,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
you will have beefalo patties

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
in your local supermarket.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
This is a geep,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
a goat-sheep hybrid.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
The scientists that made this cute little creature

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I think they said it tasted like chicken.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
This is a cama.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
with some of the personality traits

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
of a llama.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And they are now using these in certain cultures.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Then there's the liger.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
This is the largest cat in the world --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
the lion-tiger hybrid.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
It's bigger than a tiger.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And in the case of the liger,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But these were created by scientists

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
using both selective breeding and genetic technology.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And then finally, everybody's favorite,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the zorse.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And so one of the things we've been doing

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
is using genetic enhancement,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
or genetic manipulation,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
of normal selective breeding

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
pushed a little bit through genetics.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And if that were all this was about,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
then it would be an interesting thing.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
But something much, much more powerful

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is happening now.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
These are normal mammalian cells

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and put it into mammal cells.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
These are normal cells.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And what you see here

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
is these cells glowing in the dark

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
under certain wavelengths of light.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So they did it with mouse pups,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
kittens.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
while this is from jellyfish.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
They did it with pigs.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
They did it with puppies.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And, in fact,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
they did it with monkeys.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And if you can do it with monkeys --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
is actually between monkeys and apes --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
if they can do it in monkeys,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
which means they can do it in human beings.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
In other words, it is theoretically possible

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
of creating human beings

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that glow in the dark.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Be easier to find us at night.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And in fact, right now in many states,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
to be yellow, green, red,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and they are actually available now in certain states.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Other states have banned them.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
that controls genetically-engineered pets.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And so some states have decided to allow them,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
some states have decided to ban them.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Some of you may have read

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
about the FDA's consideration right now

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of genetically-engineered salmon.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
The salmon on top

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
using a gene from these salmon

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and from one other fish that we eat,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to make it grow much faster

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
using a lot less feed.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
it'll be sold in the stores.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And before you get too worried about it,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
here in the United States,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
already has genetically-modified components to it.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
So even as we worry about it,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
without any regulation,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and even without any identification on the package.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
These are all the first cloned animals

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
of their type.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So in the lower right here,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
CC the cat, for cloned cat;

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Snuppy, the first cloned dog --

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
created in South Korea

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
by the very same man that some of you may remember

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
had to end up resigning in disgrace

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.260
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
He actually was the first person

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
because dog genomes are very plastic.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
a real "gold ring" of cloning,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
because there are many horses that win important races

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
who are geldings.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
has been removed.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
But if you can clone that horse,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and his identical genetic duplicate

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
can then be put out to stud.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
These were the first cloned calves,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
the first cloned grey wolves,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and then, finally,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
the first cloned piglets:

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
(Laughter)

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
to try to save endangered species.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
This is the use of animals now

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to create drugs and other things in their bodies

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that we want to create.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So with antithrombin in that goat --

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
that goat has been genetically modified

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
so that the molecules of its milk

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
actually include the molecule of antithrombin

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that GTC Genetics wants to create.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
are pigs that they are going to use, in fact,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to try to create all kinds of drugs

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and other industrial types of chemicals

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that they want the blood and the milk

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
of these animals

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to produce for them,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
instead of producing them in an industrial way.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
These are two creatures

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that were created

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
in order to save endangered species.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
The guar

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.260
is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
A somatic cell, a body cell,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
was taken from its body,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
gestated in the ovum of a cow,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and then that cow gave birth to a guar.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Same thing happened with the mouflon,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
where it's an endangered species of sheep.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:13.260
It was gestated in a regular sheep body,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
We have our nucleic DNA

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
that everybody thinks of as our DNA,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
which are the energy packets of the cell.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So really, what you end up having here

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
is not a guar and not a mouflon,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
but a guar

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
with cow mitochondria,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and a mouflon with another species of sheep's

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
mitochondrial DNA.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
in the age of biotechnology --

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
a question that we're not really sure yet

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
how to solve.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
This lovely creature

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
is an Asian cockroach.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And what they've done here

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and then a transmitter on top,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and it's on a big computer tracking ball.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And now, using a joystick,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
they can send this creature

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
around the lab

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and control whether it goes left or right,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
forwards or backwards.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
They've created a kind of insect bot,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
or bugbot.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
This actually is one of DARPA's very important --

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
one of their projects.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
These goliath beetles

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
are wired in their wings.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
They can't actually make them land.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
They put them about one inch above the ground,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
that this creature --

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
this is a moth --

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
this is the moth in its pupa stage,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and that's when they put the wires in

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and they put in the computer technology,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
it is already prewired.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
The wires are already in its body,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and they can just hook it up to their technology,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and now they've got these bugbots

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
that they can send out for surveillance.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
They can put little cameras on them

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and perhaps someday deliver

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
other kinds of ordinance

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
to warzones.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
It's not just insects.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Again, it's got technology --

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
it's got a camera on top of its head.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
The scientists can make this creature

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
go left, right.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.260
They've now created an organic robot.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
The graduate students

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
in Sanjiv Talwar's lab

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
said, "Is this ethical?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
I'll get back to that in a minute.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
There's also been work done with monkeys.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
He took owl monkeys,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
wired them up

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
especially looking at the movement of their right arm.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
The computer learned what the monkey brain did

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
to move its arm in various ways.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
which you see here in the picture,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
put the arm in another room.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to make that arm in the other room

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
do whatever the monkey's arm did.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Then he put a video monitor

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
in the monkey's cage

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
and the monkey got fascinated.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
this prosthetic arm would do.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And eventually she was moving it and moving it,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and eventually stopped moving her right arm

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
and, staring at the screen,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
could move the prosthetic arm in the other room

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
only with her brainwaves --

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
which means that monkey

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
became the first primate in the history of the world

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
to have three independent functional arms.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And it's not just technology

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that we're putting into animals.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
He took 20,000 and then 60,000

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
disaggregated rat neurons --

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
so these are just individual neurons from rats --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
put them on a chip.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
They self-aggregated into a network,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
became an integrated chip.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And he used that

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
as the IT piece

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
So now we have organic computer chips

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
took a completely intact,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
independent lamprey eel brain.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
It is living --

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
with these electrodes going off to the sides,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
put it into a cart --

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
the cart moves toward the light;

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
when you turn it off, it moves away.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
It's photophilic.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
So now we have a complete

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
living lamprey eel brain.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
sitting there in its nutrient medium?

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
I don't know,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.260
but in fact it is a fully living brain

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
that we have managed to keep alive

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
to do our bidding.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
So, we are now at the stage

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
where we are creating creatures

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
for our own purposes.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
of the University of Massachusetts.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
He altered this mouse

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
so that it was genetically engineered

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.260
put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
and transplanted onto a human being.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Genetic engineering

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
coupled with polymer physiotechnology

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
coupled with xenotransplantation.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
This is where we are in this process.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Finally, not that long ago,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
which is a machine,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
created an artificial genome,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
put it in a different cell --

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
the genome was not of the cell he put it in --

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
and that cell then reproduced

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
as the other cell.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
In other words,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
that was the first creature in the history of the world

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
that had a computer as its parent --

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
it did not have an organic parent.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
And so, asks The Economist:

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
"The first artificial organism and its consequences."

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
So you may have thought

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that the creation of life

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
was going to happen in something that looked like that.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
(Laughter)

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
This is a DNA synthesizer,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
and here at the bottom

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
are just bottles of A, T, C and G --

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
the four chemicals

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
that make up our DNA chain.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
For the first time in the history of this planet,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
we are able to directly design organisms.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
We can manipulate the plasmas of life

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
with unprecedented power,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and it confers on us a responsibility.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
Is everything okay?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Is it okay to manipulate and create

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
whatever creatures we want?

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
Do we have free reign

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
to design animals?

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
and say, "Look, I want a dog.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.260
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
the body of a retriever,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
maybe some pink fur,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and let's make it glow in the dark"?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
Does industry get to create creatures

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
and other bodily fluids,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
create the drugs and industrial molecules we want

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
and then warehouse them

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
as organic manufacturing machines?

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Do we get to create organic robots,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
where we remove the autonomy from these animals

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
and turn them just into our playthings?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
And then the final step of this,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
once we perfect these technologies in animals

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
and we start using them in human beings,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
what are the ethical guidelines

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
that we will use then?

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
We are not only already using these things in animals,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
some of them we're already beginning to use

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
on our own bodies.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
We are now taking control of our own evolution.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
We are directly designing

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
the future of the species of this planet.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
that is not just the responsibility

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
of the scientists and the ethicists

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
who are thinking about it and writing about it now.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
It is the responsibility of everybody

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
we will have in the future.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
Thanks.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.260
(Applause)
