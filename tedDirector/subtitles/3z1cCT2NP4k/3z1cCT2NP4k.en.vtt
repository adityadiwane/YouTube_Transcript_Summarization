00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The substance of things unseen.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Cities, past and future.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
In Oxford, perhaps
we can use Lewis Carroll

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and look in the looking glass
that is New York City

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to try and see our true selves,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
or perhaps pass through to another world.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
"As the moon rose higher,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
the inessential houses began to melt away

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
until gradually I became
aware of the old island

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
here that once flowered
for Dutch sailors' eyes,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
a fresh green breast of the new world."

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
My colleagues and I
have been working for 10 years

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
to rediscover this lost world

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
in a project we call
The Mannahatta Project.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
We're trying to discover
what Henry Hudson would have seen

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
when he sailed into New York harbor.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And I'd like to tell you
the story in three acts,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and if I have time still, an epilogue.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So, Act I: A Map Found.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
So, I didn't grow up in New York.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I grew up out west in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
in the Red Rock Canyon.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And from these early
experiences as a child

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I learned to love landscapes.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And so when it became time
for me to do my graduate studies,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I studied this emerging field
of landscape ecology.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Landscape ecology concerns itself

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
with how the stream and the meadow
and the forest and the cliffs

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
make habitats for plants and animals.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This experience and this training

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
lead me to get a wonderful job
with the Wildlife Conservation Society,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
which works to save wildlife
and wild places all over the world.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And over the last decade,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I traveled to over 40 countries

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to see jaguars and bears and elephants

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and tigers and rhinos.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
But every time I would return
from my trips I'd return back to New York City.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And on my weekends I would go up,
just like all the other tourists,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
to the top of the Empire State Building,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and I'd look down on this landscape,
on these ecosystems,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
work to make habitat
for plants and animals?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
How does it work to make habitat
for animals like me?"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look
at the amazing ladies on the wall,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and wonder why nobody is looking
at the historical figures just behind them.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
I'd go to Central Park and see
the rolling topography of Central Park

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
come up against the abrupt and sheer

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.260
topography of midtown Manhattan.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I started reading about the history
and the geography in New York City.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I read that New York City
was the first mega-city,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
a city of 10 million people
or more, in 1950.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I started seeing paintings like this.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
For those of you who are from New York,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
this is 125th street
under the West Side Highway.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Laughter)

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
It was once a beach.
And this painting

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
has John James Audubon,
the painter, sitting on the rock.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And it's looking up on the wooded heights
of Washington Heights

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George
Washington Bridge goes across today.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Or this painting, from the 1740s,
from Greenwich Village.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Those are two students at King's College --
later Columbia University --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And so I'd go down to Greenwich
Village and I'd look for this hill,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and I couldn't find it.
And I couldn't find that palm tree.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
What's that palm tree doing there?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.260
(Laughter)

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So, it was in the course of these investigations
that I ran into a map.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And it's this map you see here.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
It's held in a geographic information system

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
which allows me to zoom in.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
This map isn't from Hudson's time,
but from the American Revolution,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
170 years later, made by
British military cartographers

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
during the occupation of New York City.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And it's a remarkable map.
It's in the National Archives here in Kew.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And it's 10 feet long and
three and a half feet wide.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
you can see the extent
of New York City as it was,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
right at the end of the American Revolution.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Here's Bowling Green.
And here's Broadway.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And this is City Hall Park.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
So the city basically extended
to City Hall Park.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And just beyond it you can see features

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that have vanished,
things that have disappeared.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
This is the Collect Pond, which was
the fresh water source for New York City

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
for its first 200 years,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and for the Native Americans
for thousands of years before that.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
You can see the Lispenard Meadows

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
draining down through here,
through what is TriBeCa now,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and the beaches that
come up from the Battery,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
all the way to 42nd St.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
This map was made for military reasons.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
They're mapping the roads,
the buildings, these fortifications

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that they built.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
But they're also mapping
things of ecological interest,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
also military interest: the hills,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
the marshes, the streams.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
This is Richmond Hill,
and Minetta Water,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
which used to run its way
through Greenwich Village.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Or Murray Hill.
And this is the Murrays' house

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Here is Times Square,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
the two streams that came
together to make a wetland

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.260
in Times Square, as it was
at the end of the American Revolution.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And I thought to myself, "You know,
if I could georeference this map,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
if I could place this map
in the grid of the city today,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I could find these lost features

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of the city,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
in the block-by-block
geography that people know,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
the geography of where people
go to work, and where they go to live,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and where they like to eat."

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So, after some work
we were able to georeference it,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
which allows us to put
the modern streets on the city,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and the buildings, and the open spaces,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.260
so that we can zoom in
to where the Collect Pond is.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
We can digitize the Collect
Pond and the streams,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and see where they actually are
in the geography of the city today.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So this is fun
for finding where things are

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.260
relative to the old topography.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
But I had another idea about this map.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
If we take away the streets,
and if we take away the buildings,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and if we take away the open spaces,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
then we could take this map.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
If we pull off the 18th century features

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
we could drive it back in time.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We could drive it back
to its ecological fundamentals:

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to the hills, to the streams,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to the basic hydrology
and shoreline, to the beaches,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
the basic aspects that
make the ecological landscape.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Then, if we added maps
like the geology, the bedrock geology,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and the surface geology,
what the glaciers leave,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
if we make the soil map,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
with the 17 soil classes,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that are defined by
the National Conservation Service,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
if we make a digital elevation model

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
of the topography
that tells us how high the hills were,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
then we can calculate the slopes.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
We can calculate the aspect.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
We can calculate the
winter wind exposure --

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
so, which way the winter
winds blow across the landscape.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.260
The white areas on this map
are the places protected from the winter winds.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
We compiled all the information
about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And we built a probability map
of where they might have been.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
So, the red areas
on this map indicate the places

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
that are best for human
sustainability on Manhattan,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
places that are close to water,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
places that are near the harbor to fish,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
places protected from the winter winds.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
We know that there was a Lenape settlement

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
down here by the Collect Pond.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And we knew that they
planted a kind of horticulture,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
that they grew these beautiful gardens
of corn, beans, and squash,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
the "Three Sisters" garden.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.260
So, we built a model that explains
where those fields might have been.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And we might think of these as abandoned.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
for grassland birds and plants.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And they have become
successional shrub lands,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and these then mix in
to a map of all the ecological communities.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And it turns out that Manhattan
had 55 different ecosystem types.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
You can think of these as neighborhoods,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.260
as distinctive as TriBeCa
and the Upper East Side and Inwood --

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that these are the forest and the wetlands

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and the marine communities, the beaches.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Manhattan had more ecological communities

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
per acre than Yosemite does,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
It was really an extraordinary landscape

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
that was capable of supporting
an extraordinary biodiversity.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So, we studied the fish and the frogs
and the birds and the bees,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
the 85 different kinds of fish
that were on Manhattan,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
the Heath hens, the species
that aren't there anymore,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
the beavers on all the streams,
the black bears,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and the Native Americans,
to study how they used

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and thought about their landscape.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
We wanted to try and map these.
And to do that what we did

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
was we mapped their habitat needs.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Where do they get their food?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Where do they get their water?
Where do they get their shelter?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Where do they get their
reproductive resources?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
To an ecologist, the intersection
of these is habitat,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
but to most people,
the intersection of these is their home.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So, we would read in field guides,
the standard field guides

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that maybe you have on your shelves,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
you know, what beavers need is,
"A slowly meandering stream

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
with aspen trees and alders and willows,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
near the water."
That's the best thing for a beaver.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So we just started making a list.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Here is the beaver.
And here is the stream,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and the aspen and the alder
and the willow.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
As if these were the maps
that we would need

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
to predict where you would find the beaver.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows
and insects and sunny places.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits
and beavers and den sites.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And rapidly we started to realize
that beavers can be

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
something that a bobcat needs.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
But a beaver also needs things.
And that having it

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
on either side means that
we can link it together,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
that we can create the network

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
of the habitat relationships
for these species.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Moreover, we realized
that you can start out

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
as being a beaver specialist,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
but you can look up what an aspen needs.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And you can look at
what a wet meadow needs.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And it need beavers
to create the wetlands,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and maybe some other things.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But you can also talk
about sunny places.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
So, what does a sunny place need?
Not habitat per se.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
But what are the conditions
that make it possible?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Or fire. Or dry soils.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And that you can put these
on a grid that's 1,000 columns long

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
across the top and 1,000 rows
down the other way.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And then we can visualize
this data like a network,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
like a social network.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And this is the network
of all the habitat relationships

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
of all the plants and animals
on Manhattan,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and everything they needed,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
going back to the geology,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
going back to time and space
at the very core of the web.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
We call this the Muir Web.
And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Each point is a different species

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
or a different stream
or a different soil type.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And those little gray lines are the connections
that connect them together.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
They are the connections
that actually make nature resilient.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And the structure of this
is what makes nature work,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
seen with all its parts.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
We call these Muir Webs
after the Scottish-American naturalist

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
John Muir, who said, "When we try
to pick out anything by itself,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
we find that it's bound fast
by a thousand invisible cords

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that cannot be broken,
to everything in the universe."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So then we took the Muir webs
and we took them back to the maps.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and Lex and Third,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
maybe there was a stream in that block.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And these would be the kind of trees
that might have been there,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and the flowers and the lichens
and the mosses,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
the butterflies, the fish in the stream,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
the birds in the trees.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And perhaps a black bear walked by.
And maybe Native Americans were there.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And then we took this data.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
You can see this for yourself
on our website.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
You can zoom into
any block on Manhattan,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and see what might have
been there 400 years ago.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And we used it to try
and reveal a landscape

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
here in Act III.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
We used the tools they use in Hollywood

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
to make these fantastic landscapes
that we all see in the movies.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.260
So we would take the landscape
and we would build up the topography.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,
and illuminate the landscape.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
We would lay on top of that
the map of the ecological communities.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And feed into that the map of the species.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
So that we would actually take a photograph,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
flying above Times Square,
looking toward the Hudson River,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
waiting for Hudson to come.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Using this technology, we can make these

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
fantastic georeferenced views.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
We can basically take a picture
out of any window

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
on Manhattan and see what that landscape
looked like 400 years ago.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
This is the view from the East River,
looking up Murray Hill

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
at where the United Nations is today.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
This is the view looking
down the Hudson River,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
with Manhattan on the left,
and New Jersey out on the right,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
This is the view over Times Square,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.260
with the beaver pond there,
looking out toward the east.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.260
So we can see the Collect Pond,
and Lispenard Marshes back behind.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
We can see the fields
that the Native Americans made.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And we can see this
in the geography of the city today.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So when you're watching "Law and Order,"
and the lawyers walk up the steps

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
they could have walked
back down those steps

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
of the New York Court House,
right into the Collect Pond,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
400 years ago.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
So these images are the work
of my friend and colleague,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Mark Boyer, who is here
in the audience today.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And I'd just like, if you would
give him a hand,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
to call out for his fine work.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:18.260
(Applause)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
There is such power in bringing
science and visualization together,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
that we can create images like this,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
perhaps looking on either
side of a looking glass.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And even though I've only
had a brief time to speak,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
I hope you appreciate that
Mannahatta was a very special place.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
The place that you see here
on the left side

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
was interconnected.
It was based on this diversity.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.260
It had this resilience that is
what we need in our modern world.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But I wouldn't have you think
that I don't like the place

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
on the right, which I quite do.
I've come to love the city

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
and its kind of diversity,
and its resilience,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and its dependence on density
and how we're connected together.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
In fact, that I see them
as reflections of each other,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
much as Lewis Carroll did
in "Through the Looking Glass."

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We can compare these two and hold them
in our minds at the same time,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
that they really are the same place,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
that there is no way that cities
can escape from nature.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.260
And I think this is what we're learning
about building cities in the future.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,
not about the past,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
but about 400 years from now,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
what we're realizing is that

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
cities are habitats for people,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and need to supply what people need:

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
a sense of home, food, water, shelter,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
reproductive resources,
and a sense of meaning.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
This is the particular additional
habitat requirement of humanity.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
And so many of the talks here
at TED are about meaning,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
about bringing meaning to our lives

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
in all kinds of different ways, through technology,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
through art, through science,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
so much so that I think
we focus so much on

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
that side of our lives,
that we haven't given enough

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
attention to the food and the water
and the shelter,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and what we need to raise the kids.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
So, how can we envision
the city of the future?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Well, what if we go
to Madison Square Park,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and we imagine it without all the cars,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and bicycles instead

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and large forests, and streams instead
of sewers and storm drains?

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
What if we imagined the Upper East Side

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.260
with green roofs, and streams
winding through the city,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and windmills supplying
the power we need?

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
Or if we imagine the New York
City metropolitan area,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
currently home to 12 million people,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
but 12 million people in the future,
perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
in only 36 percent of the area,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
with the areas in between
covered by farmland,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
covered by wetlands,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
covered by the marshes we need.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
This is the kind of future I think we need,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
is a future that has the same diversity

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
but that learns from the
sustainability of the past,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.260
of the ecology, the original ecology,
of nature with all its parts.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:03.260
(Applause)
