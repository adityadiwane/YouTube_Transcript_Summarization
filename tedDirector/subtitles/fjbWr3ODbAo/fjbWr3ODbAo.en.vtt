00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that's that I'm a philosopher.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When I go to an academic cocktail party

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When I go to a philosopher's party

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the way philosophers go about their business.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's very hard to change people's minds

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
about something like consciousness,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and I finally figured out the reason for that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
they've just got strong opinions.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
encounter people who have very strong opinions

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
about what's going to happen next.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They're just strongly held opinions.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
each of us seems to think, "I am an expert.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And so, you tell them your theory and they say,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
No, you've got it all wrong."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And they say this with an amazing confidence.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And so what I'm going to try to do today

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I can feel it myself.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That's the order of the day here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I think everybody understands what that means.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
What I particularly like about this picture, too,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is that Steinberg has rendered the guy

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in this sort of pointillist style.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's what we're made of.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Not a single one of those cells is conscious;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Somehow, we have to explain

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
how when you put together teams, armies, battalions

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the result is this. I mean, just look at it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
They think, "No, there can't be any

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and he's an expert magician, and an expert

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
"Net of Magic."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It speaks so eloquently to the problem.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(Laughter)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So this is the problem. So I have to

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
do a little bit of the sort of work

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that a lot of you won't like,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
for the same reason that you don't like to see

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
a magic trick explained to you.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Don't tell me the answer."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But I'm not going to explain it all to you.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'm going to do what philosophers do.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
(Laughter)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
"He merely makes you think that he does."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
(Laughter)

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
But I'm going to try to also show you

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
as you may have thought it is.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
He didn't even try to do those things.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
People's memories inflate what they think they saw.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And the same is true of consciousness.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Watch it carefully.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We're looking for a backer.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Even when you know that they're all going to change color,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to pick up any of the changes at all.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Now, this is an example -- one of many --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
where I said if you did experiments of this sort,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
If there's time at the end,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I'll show you the much more dramatic case.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and that we're not aware of them?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
looking at interesting things in the world.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And where your eye isn't looking,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
That's because the foveal part of your eye,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
which is the high-resolution part,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
That's the detail part.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It doesn't seem that way, does it?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You're getting in a lot less information than you think.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's in the museum in North Carolina.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I love paintings like that --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and you can get right up

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and see all the details on the painting.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And I started across the hall in North Carolina,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and would have all that in detail.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I thought as I got closer

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I would be able to see all the detail of most people,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
see their clothes, and so forth.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I yelled out because when I got closer,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I found the detail wasn't there at all.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And as I walked towards the picture,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I was expecting detail that wasn't there.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and wagons and all sorts of things,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and my brain had taken the suggestion.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
you can get a better view of the blobs.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
See, when you get close

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
they're really just blobs of paint.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I'll just give that to you one more time.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
suggests a person -- say, one of

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Marvin Minsky's little society of mind --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's the same thing.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It's just making you expect the detail.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Let's just do this experiment very quickly.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Yes.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
How do you know that's what you did?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
(Laughter)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
There's in fact been a very interesting debate

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
raging for over 20 years in cognitive science --

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Yes, it's possible to do that.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And if you read that literature, one of the things

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that you really have to come to terms with is

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You don't know how you do it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
You just know that you have certain beliefs.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And what explains the fact that that's what you think?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You may think that I've cheated,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
How many of you see that sort of boundary,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Can you see it?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Your brain is actually computing that boundary,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the boundary that goes right there.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
It's a Necker cube.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Because there's another way of seeing it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
As a cube, on a black background,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
(Laughter)

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
(Laughter)

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
those boundaries go away.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Does your brain have to send little painters in there?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The purple-painters and the green-painters

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
When I first started talking about

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I'll go back to it, this one --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I said that there was no filling-in behind there.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Now, if you think you see some pale yellow --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I'll run this a few more times.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Look in the gray areas,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Let me just pause this for a second if I can.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
This is change-blindness.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
What you're going to see is two pictures,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
one of which is slightly different from the other.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
You see here the red roof and the gray roof,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and in between them there will be a mask,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
then the second picture, then a mask.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
is to press the button when you see the change.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
"I see the change."

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
We're going to start easy. Some examples.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
No trouble there.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Can everybody see? All right.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
than a second to press the button.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Can you see that one?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
2.9 seconds.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
How many don't see it still?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
What's on the roof of that barn?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
(Laughter)

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It's easy.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Is it a bridge or a dock?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Can you see it?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Audience: Yes.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So 15.5 seconds is the median time

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
for subjects in his experiment there.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I love this one. I'll end with this one,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
just because it's such an obvious and important thing.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
(Laughter)

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Right in the middle of the picture!

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Thanks very much for your attention.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
What I wanted to show you is that scientists,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
can tell you things about your own consciousness

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that you would never dream of,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
and that, in fact, you're not the authority

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
on your own consciousness that you think you are.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And we're really making a lot of progress

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
on coming up with a theory of mind.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And he's right. This is a problem.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
(Laughter)

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
(Applause)
