00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:19.578
The story starts:
I was at a friend's house,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.640
and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:25.876
which is the manual of mental disorders.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.170
It lists every known mental disorder.

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:32.227
And it used to be, back in the '50s,
a very slim pamphlet.

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.876
And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.982
and now it's 886 pages long.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:42.350
And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.092
So I was leafing through it,

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:47.033
wondering if I had any mental disorders,

00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:48.718
and it turns out I've got 12.

00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:49.893
(Laughter)

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.615
I've got generalized anxiety disorder,

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:53.885
which is a given.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.925
I've got nightmare disorder,

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.314
which is categorized

00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:01.378
if you have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.077
and all my dreams involve people
chasing me down the street

00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:06.725
going, "You're a failure!"

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.532
(Laughter)

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:11.658
I've got parent-child relational problems,

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.627
which I blame my parents for.

00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.546
(Laughter)

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.928
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.102
I'm kidding.

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:21.124
And I've got malingering.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.884
And I think it's actually quite rare

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:25.924
to have both malingering
and generalized anxiety disorder,

00:01:25.948 --> 00:01:28.659
because malingering tends
to make me feel very anxious.

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:30.671
Anyway, I was looking through this book,

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.296
wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.853
or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:39.003
if you're not a trained professional,

00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:43.900
or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:48.290
to label what's essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:52.092
I didn't know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,

00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:54.976
and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.384
to get their view,

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.746
which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.006
(Laughter)

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.528
It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:09.820
who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.833
They're called the CCHR.

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:14.808
And I said to him, "Can you prove to me

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:18.309
that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
that can't be trusted?"

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:21.099
And he said, "Yes,
we can prove it to you."

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:22.536
And I said, "How?"

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.345
And he said, "We're going
to introduce you to Tony."

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:27.604
And I said, "Who's Tony?"

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:31.543
And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.877
Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:38.535
It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.995
It's where they send the serial killers,

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.075
and the people who can't help themselves.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.256
And I said to Brian,
"Well, what did Tony do?"

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.729
And he said, "Hardly anything.

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:52.366
He beat someone up or something,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.485
and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.022
But he faked it too well,
and now he's stuck in Broadmoor

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.507
and nobody will believe he's sane.

00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:08.268
Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.504
So I said, "Yes, please."

00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:12.170
So I got the train to Broadmoor.

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:16.289
I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,

00:03:16.313 --> 00:03:18.695
which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.972
they yawn uncontrollably.

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:22.272
And we got to Broadmoor.

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:27.171
And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:30.692
into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:34.154
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.

00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:38.089
It's all peach and pine
and calming colors.

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:43.305
And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:46.174
And the patients started drifting in.

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:50.989
And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,

00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:52.672
and quite docile-looking.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.435
And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.369
"They're medicated,"

00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:00.612
which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:03.217
but I'm thinking
it's probably a good idea.

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:04.837
(Laughter)

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.420
And then Brian said, "Here's Tony."

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.938
And a man was walking in.

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:13.529
And he wasn't overweight,
he was in very good physical shape.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.856
And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.270
he was wearing a pinstripe suit.

00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:20.290
And he had his arm outstretched

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:22.374
like someone out of The Apprentice.

00:04:22.398 --> 00:04:25.680
He looked like a man
who wanted to wear an outfit

00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:29.475
that would convince me
that he was very sane.

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:31.414
And he sat down.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.343
And I said, "So is it true
that you faked your way in here?"

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:38.207
And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
I beat someone up when I was 17.

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.313
And I was in prison awaiting trial,

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:41.652
and my cellmate said to me,

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:43.160
'You know what you have to do?

00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:44.559
Fake madness.

00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:48.783
Tell them you're mad, you'll get
sent to some cushy hospital.

00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:52.638
Nurses will bring you pizzas,
you'll have your own PlayStation.'"

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:54.354
I said, "Well, how did you do it?"

00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:57.121
He said, "Well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.

00:04:57.145 --> 00:04:59.432
And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:03.559
in which people get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.532
So I said to the psychiatrist,

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:09.321
'I get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.'"

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:10.770
And I said, "What else?"

00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:13.447
He said, "Oh, yeah.
I told the psychiatrist

00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.755
that I wanted to watch women as they died,

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.944
because it would make
me feel more normal."

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:20.690
I said, "Where'd you get that from?"

00:05:20.714 --> 00:05:23.498
He said, "Oh, from a biography
of Ted Bundy that they had

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:24.715
at the prison library."

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.976
Anyway, he faked madness
too well, he said.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.470
And they didn't send him
to some cushy hospital.

00:05:31.494 --> 00:05:33.075
They sent him to Broadmoor.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.136
And the minute he got there,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.266
said he took one look at the place,
asked to see the psychiatrist,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.808
said, "There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.241
I'm not mentally ill."

00:05:43.032 --> 00:05:45.298
I said, "How long have you been here for?"

00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:47.668
He said, "Well, if I'd just
done my time in prison

00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:50.395
for the original crime,
I'd have got five years.

00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:53.287
I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."

00:05:56.171 --> 00:06:00.200
Tony said that it's a lot harder
to convince people you're sane

00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:02.708
than it is to convince them you're crazy.

00:06:02.732 --> 00:06:04.955
He said, "I thought
the best way to seem normal

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.599
would be to talk to people
normally about normal things

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:09.501
like football or what's on TV.

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:11.263
I subscribe to New Scientist,

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.954
and recently they had an article

00:06:12.978 --> 00:06:17.338
about how the U.S. Army was training
bumblebees to sniff out explosives.

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:18.781
So I said to a nurse,

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:21.404
'Did you know that the U.S. Army
is training bumblebees

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:22.756
to sniff out explosives?'

00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:26.302
When I read my medical notes,
I saw they'd written:

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:29.658
'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"

00:06:29.682 --> 00:06:31.236
(Laughter)

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.367
He said, "You know, they're always
looking out for nonverbal clues

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:36.131
to my mental state.

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:38.792
But how do you sit in a sane way?

00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:41.088
How do you cross your legs in a sane way?

00:06:41.112 --> 00:06:42.620
It's just impossible."

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:44.193
When Tony said that to me,

00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:47.726
I thought to myself,
"Am I sitting like a journalist?

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.416
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"

00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:56.404
He said, "You know, I've got
the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,

00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:58.817
and I've got the 'Tiptoe
Through the Tulips' rapist

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:00.208
on the other side of me.

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:03.681
So I tend to stay in my room a lot
because I find them quite frightening.

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:05.966
And they take that as a sign of madness.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.505
They say it proves
that I'm aloof and grandiose."

00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:13.749
So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
to hang out with serial killers

00:07:13.773 --> 00:07:15.360
be a sign of madness.

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:18.460
Anyway, he seemed completely normal
to me, but what did I know?

00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:21.994
And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.

00:07:22.018 --> 00:07:23.592
I said, "What's the story?"

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:27.127
And he said, "Yep.
We accept that Tony faked madness

00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.917
to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations --

00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:33.092
that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with --

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:35.734
just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.

00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:37.963
However, we have assessed him,

00:07:37.987 --> 00:07:40.400
and we've determined that what he is

00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:41.812
is a psychopath."

00:07:42.243 --> 00:07:44.051
And in fact, faking madness

00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:48.441
is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:50.883
It's on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.987
So, faking your brain going wrong

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:56.243
is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.839
And I spoke to other experts,

00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:01.802
and they said the pinstripe
suit -- classic psychopath --

00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:04.104
speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:

00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:07.472
glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:11.581
And I said, "Well, but why didn't
he hang out with the other patients?"

00:08:11.605 --> 00:08:15.535
Classic psychopath -- it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:19.442
So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:22.491
was evidence, according to his clinician,

00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:24.339
that he was mad in this new way.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.093
He was a psychopath.

00:08:26.117 --> 00:08:29.642
And his clinician said to me, "If you
want to know more about psychopaths,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:32.871
you can go on a psychopath-spotting course

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.782
run by Robert Hare, who invented
the psychopath checklist."

00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:36.966
So I did.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.033
I went on a psychopath-spotting course,

00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:43.234
and I am now a certified --

00:08:43.258 --> 00:08:47.517
and I have to say, extremely adept --
psychopath spotter.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.439
So, here's the statistics:

00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:55.585
One in a hundred regular people
is a psychopath.

00:08:56.255 --> 00:09:00.088
So there's 1,500 people in his room.

00:09:00.112 --> 00:09:03.155
Fifteen of you are psychopaths.

00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:10.073
Although that figure rises to four percent
of CEOs and business leaders,

00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:12.832
so I think there's a very good chance

00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:17.970
there's about 30 or 40
psychopaths in this room.

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:20.428
It could be carnage
by the end of the night.

00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:24.908
(Laughter)

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:29.828
Hare said the reason why
is because capitalism at its most ruthless

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:32.496
rewards psychopathic behavior --

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.457
the lack of empathy, the glibness,

00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:39.839
cunning, manipulative.

00:09:39.863 --> 00:09:42.828
In fact, capitalism, perhaps
at its most remorseless,

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:46.631
is a physical manifestation
of psychopathy.

00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:52.230
It's like a form of psychopathy
that's come down to affect us all.

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:55.438
Hare said, "You know what?
Forget about some guy at Broadmoor

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.277
who may or may not have faked madness.

00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.922
Who cares? That's not a big story.

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:01.839
The big story," he said,
"is corporate psychopathy.

00:10:01.863 --> 00:10:05.694
You want to go and interview yourself
some corporate psychopaths."

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:09.399
So I gave it a try.
I wrote to the Enron people.

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:11.769
I said, "Could I come
and interview you in prison,

00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:13.563
to find out it you're psychopaths?"

00:10:13.587 --> 00:10:14.817
(Laughter)

00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:16.117
And they didn't reply.

00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:17.691
(Laughter)

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:19.612
So I changed tack.

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.912
I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:26.475
the asset stripper from the 1990s.

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:28.706
He would come into failing businesses

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.765
and close down 30 percent
of the workforce,

00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:33.933
just turn American towns into ghost towns.

00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:35.410
And I emailed him and I said,

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:38.228
"I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly

00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:40.263
that makes you ... special,

00:10:40.287 --> 00:10:44.648
and interested in the predatory
spirit, and fearless.

00:10:44.672 --> 00:10:48.124
Can I come and interview you
about your special brain anomaly?"

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.966
And he said, "Come on over!"

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.351
(Laughter)

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:54.427
So I went to Al Dunlap's
grand Florida mansion.

00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:59.159
It was filled with sculptures
of predatory animals.

00:10:59.522 --> 00:11:03.161
There were lions and tigers --
he was taking me through the garden --

00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:05.877
there were falcons and eagles,

00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:08.405
he was saying, "Over there
you've got sharks and --"

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:10.642
he was saying this
in a less effeminate way --

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:14.868
"You've got more sharks
and you've got tigers."

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:18.066
It was like Narnia.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.568
(Laughter)

00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:23.238
And then we went into his kitchen.

00:11:24.032 --> 00:11:28.184
Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
to save failing companies,

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:30.631
he'd close down 30 percent
of the workforce.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:33.834
And he'd quite often
fire people with a joke.

00:11:33.858 --> 00:11:36.203
Like, for instance,
one famous story about him,

00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:39.679
somebody came up to him and said,
"I've just bought myself a new car."

00:11:39.703 --> 00:11:41.711
And he said, "Well,
you may have a new car,

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:45.240
but I'll tell you what you
don't have -- a job."

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:47.958
So in his kitchen --

00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:50.940
he was in there with his wife, Judy,
and his bodyguard, Sean --

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:53.020
and I said, "You know
how I said in my email

00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:56.680
that you might have a special brain
anomaly that makes you special?"

00:11:56.704 --> 00:11:59.606
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing
theory, it's like Star Trek.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.842
You're going where
no man has gone before."

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:04.970
And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)

00:12:04.994 --> 00:12:06.323
(Laughter)

00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:09.510
Some psychologists might say

00:12:09.534 --> 00:12:12.212
that this makes you --"
(Mumbles)

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:13.863
(Laughter)

00:12:13.887 --> 00:12:15.361
And he said, "What?"

00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:17.405
And I said, "A psychopath."

00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:21.808
And I said, "I've got a list
of psychopathic traits in my pocket.

00:12:21.832 --> 00:12:23.991
Can I go through them with you?"

00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.746
And he looked intrigued despite himself,

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.145
and he said, "Okay, go on."

00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:31.552
And I said, "Okay.
Grandiose sense of self-worth."

00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:34.352
Which I have to say, would
have been hard for him to deny,

00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:37.760
because he was standing
under a giant oil painting of himself.

00:12:37.784 --> 00:12:41.935
(Laughter)

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:44.992
He said, "Well, you've
got to believe in you!"

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:47.904
And I said, "Manipulative."

00:12:47.928 --> 00:12:49.621
He said, "That's leadership."

00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:50.646
(Laughter)

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.076
And I said, "Shallow affect,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.372
an inability to experience
a range of emotions."

00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:59.002
He said, "Who wants to be weighed
down by some nonsense emotions?"

00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:01.197
So he was going down
the psychopath checklist,

00:13:01.221 --> 00:13:04.422
basically turning it
into "Who Moved My Cheese?"

00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:07.538
(Laughter)

00:13:07.562 --> 00:13:10.982
But I did notice something happening
to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.

00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:13.903
Whenever he said anything to me
that was kind of normal --

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:16.870
like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,

00:13:16.894 --> 00:13:18.800
he said he got accepted into West Point,

00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:21.679
and they don't let
delinquents in West Point.

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:24.419
He said "no" to many short-term
marital relationships.

00:13:24.443 --> 00:13:26.103
He's only ever been married twice.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:29.074
Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers

00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:31.538
that he once threatened her with a knife

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:34.279
and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,

00:13:34.303 --> 00:13:36.345
but people say stupid things to each other

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:38.424
in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,

00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:41.469
and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.

00:13:41.493 --> 00:13:45.191
So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,

00:13:45.215 --> 00:13:48.358
I thought to myself, well I'm not
going to put that in my book.

00:13:48.868 --> 00:13:52.172
And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:55.672
had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.

00:13:55.696 --> 00:14:00.640
Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked "Psychopath."

00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:05.374
I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.

00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:06.600
And I realized, my God --

00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:08.627
this is what I've been doing for 20 years.

00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:10.273
It's what all journalists do.

00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:13.757
We travel across the world
with our notepads in our hands,

00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:15.576
and we wait for the gems.

00:14:16.242 --> 00:14:20.575
And the gems are always
the outermost aspects

00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:22.228
of our interviewee's personality.

00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:25.726
And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.277
and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.

00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:33.206
And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.507
certain mental disorders hugely.

00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:37.873
Childhood bipolar --

00:14:37.897 --> 00:14:41.452
children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar

00:14:41.476 --> 00:14:43.906
because they have temper tantrums,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.644
which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:51.496
When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.

00:14:52.697 --> 00:14:55.470
He said, "Why haven't you
been returning my calls?"

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:58.843
I said, "Well, they say
that you're a psychopath."

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:00.821
And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."

00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:02.004
He said, "You know what?

00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:04.700
One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,

00:15:04.724 --> 00:15:07.585
but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.

00:15:07.609 --> 00:15:09.975
So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:11.739
they say, 'Typical of the psychopath

00:15:11.763 --> 00:15:15.140
to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn't.'

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:18.232
It's like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down."

00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:21.816
He said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.080
Will you come to it?"

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.157
So I said okay.

00:15:25.783 --> 00:15:27.267
So I went to his tribunal.

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:32.043
And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.

00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:35.906
They decided that he shouldn't
be held indefinitely

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.620
because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean

00:15:39.644 --> 00:15:44.175
that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.390
So they let him go.

00:15:46.414 --> 00:15:48.435
And outside in the corridor he said to me,

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:49.614
"You know what, Jon?

00:15:50.101 --> 00:15:52.064
Everyone's a bit psychopathic."

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.147
He said, "You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am."

00:15:57.276 --> 00:15:59.288
I said, "What are you going to do now?"

00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:01.495
He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.197
There's a woman there that I fancy.

00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:07.176
But she's married, so I'm going to have
to get her split up from her husband."

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.957
(Laughter)

00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:14.368
Anyway, that was two years ago,

00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:15.970
and that's where my book ended.

00:16:15.994 --> 00:16:20.556
And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.621
Nothing bad happened.

00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:24.784
He was living with a girl outside London.

00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:26.906
He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.956
making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.536
but isn't necessarily ominous.

00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:34.119
Unfortunately, after 20 months,

00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:36.853
he did go back to jail for a month.

00:16:36.877 --> 00:16:41.033
He got into a "fracas"
in a bar, he called it.

00:16:41.364 --> 00:16:44.005
Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:47.917
but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:49.546
it wasn't too bad.

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:51.890
And then he phoned me.

00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:57.298
And you know what, I think
it's right that Tony is out.

00:16:58.158 --> 00:17:01.313
Because you shouldn't define
people by their maddest edges.

00:17:01.337 --> 00:17:05.173
And what Tony is,
is he's a semi-psychopath.

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:10.322
He's a gray area in a world
that doesn't like gray areas.

00:17:11.056 --> 00:17:15.053
But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.

00:17:16.052 --> 00:17:18.473
It's where you find the humanity,

00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:20.371
and it's where you find the truth.

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.489
And Tony said to me,

00:17:23.513 --> 00:17:27.385
"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:30.709
I just want to thank you
for everything you've done for me."

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:32.024
And I didn't go.

00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:34.754
What would you have done?

00:17:35.761 --> 00:17:37.113
Thank you.

00:17:37.137 --> 00:17:43.784
(Applause)
