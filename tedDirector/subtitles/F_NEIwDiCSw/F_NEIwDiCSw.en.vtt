00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
to presenting great American lives,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
amazing people.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And that's what it's about.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.260
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I started to worry about the fact

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and they're amazing people,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and we want to deliver them to future generations.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
So, how do we do that?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
my being a brush in the hand

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
the great hits of that program,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
as to give you this whole notion

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
what you try to find out about them,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Now, I had two preconditions.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
One was that they be American.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
it's created to look at American lives.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
That was easy, but then I made the decision,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
maybe arbitrary,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that they needed to be people of a certain age,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
which at that point, when I created this program,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
seemed really old.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And why did I do that?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And I thought really what we need is an elders program

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
the more convinced I am that that's true.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
It's amazing what people will say when they know

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
how the story turned out.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
That's the one advantage that older people have.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
but they also have some disadvantages,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
but the one thing they or we have is that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
we've reached the point in life

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
where we know how the story turned out.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So, we can then go back in our lives,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and begin to reflect on how we got there.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
All of those accidents that wound up

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
creating the life narrative that we inherited.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So, I thought okay, now,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
what is it going to take to make this work?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
There are the journalist interviews,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
which are the interrogation that is expected.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
This is somewhat against resistance

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Then there's the celebrity interview,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
as Nixon in that process.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Fair enough.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
But I wanted interviews that were different.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.260
which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and to be an agent of their self-revelation.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
By the way, this was always done in public.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
This was not an oral history program.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.260
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I didn't know it coming into it.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And the only reason I really know that

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.260
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And he had never appeared in public since that point.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
This was not a devastating stroke,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
but it did affect his speaking and so forth.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And I thought it was worth a chance,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
he thought it was worth a chance,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and so we got up on the stage,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and we had an hour conversation about his life,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and after that a woman rushed up to me,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
essentially did,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
When he started a sentence, particularly

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
in the early parts of the interview,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and paused, you gave him the word,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and by the end of it,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I didn't know what was going on,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
or empathy, at any rate,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
is what's critical to this kind of interview.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
But then I began to think of other things.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Who makes a great interview in this context?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
It had nothing to do with their intellect,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
the quality of their intellect.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Some of them were very brilliant,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
some of them were,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
but it was never about that.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
It was about their energy.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and extraordinary lives.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
I'm convinced of it.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
These were people through their 90s.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
In fact, the first person I interviewed

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
was George Abbott, who was 97,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and Abbott was filled with the life force --

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And so he filled the room,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and we had an extraordinary conversation.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
because he was famous for being silent,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
for never ever saying anything

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
except maybe a word or two.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.260
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
He subsequently got married again at 102,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
But after the interview, I got a call,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
very gruff voice, from a woman.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
I didn't know who she was,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and I could never do it."

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And then she made me go up with the tape of it

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So, you know, you want energy,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
you want the life force,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
but you really want them also to think

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that they have a story worth sharing.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The worst interviews that you can ever have

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
are with people who are modest.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
because all of these people have been assembled

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.260
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Didn't matter." Whatever.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Awful.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
They have to think that they did something

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
and that they want to share it with you.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.260
But it comes down, in the end,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:01.260
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
All of us are public and private beings,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
there's no point in it.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and we all have infomercials about our lives.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
We know the great lines, we know the great moments,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
we know what we're not going to share,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Mike Wallace's old interviews --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:44.260
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and the more public they had been,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.260
the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that happened in this interview series.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.260
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and particularly certain people.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
It'll be your generational determinant

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
as to whether her name means much to you.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
She did so much. She was a playwright.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
She did an extraordinary play called "The Women."

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
She was a congresswoman

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
when there weren't very many congresswomen.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
She was editor of Vanity Fair,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
one of the great phenomenal women of her day.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And, incidentally, I call her

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
She was sort of adored on the Right

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And, in fact, when we did the interview --

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
I did the living self-portrait with her --

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
there were three former directors of the CIA

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
basically sitting at her feet,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
just enjoying her presence.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.260
because I always have preliminary talks with these people

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
We never talk before that because if you talk before,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
you don't get it on the stage.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.260
So she and I had a delightful conversation.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
We were on the stage and then --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
by the way, spectacular.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
She was in a great evening gown.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
She was 80, almost that day of the interview,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and there she was and there I was,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and I just proceeded into the questions.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and I was basically up there -- any of you

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
in the moderate-to-full entertainment world

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
know what it is to die onstage.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And I began to wonder what was going on,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and you think while you talk,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and basically, I thought, I got it.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
When we were alone, I was her audience.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Now I'm her competitor for the audience.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and so then I asked her a question --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:20.260
I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and again, characteristically,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And then she turned to me and said,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
"And you know what those young actors did?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Just withering in her contempt.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And I said, "I'm learning."

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
(Laughter)

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
of what her life really was like.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Again, a remarkable person.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
I'm attracted to her.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.260
And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And she was in horrible pain.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
We all knew that.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
She stayed in her room.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
The usual sort of thing.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Then at a certain moment, the door opened

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.260
The public self, the beauty, the intellect,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and she walked around and talked to every person there

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and then went back into the room and was never seen again.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.260
She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and this is just a brief reference.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
It wasn't this arm-wrestle,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
but it was a little surprising for the person involved.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And we were sitting there,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and almost toward the beginning of the interview,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.260
I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:42.260
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Was yours unhappy?"

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And he looked at me, you know, as if to say,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And then he turned to me, not stupidly,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and he said, "What was your childhood like?"

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
which is why I'm not funny."

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
(Laughter)

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
His father was an SOB,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.260
and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
but then we were off and running.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.260
So the question is:

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Now, these are arm wrestle questions,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
but I want to tell you about questions

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
that are more related to empathy

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and that really, very often, are the questions

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.260
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.260
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.260
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.260
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and by the way, at one point I asked him,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
"Would you like to have met him?"

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And he said, "Well, of course,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
because I got to read all of his letters."

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:15.260
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And I asked him one question.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.260
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and connecting with him,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.260
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
He said, "You know, I've read everything,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And he basically was saying that this was a man

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
who lied more than he wished he had,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
because he saw the letters.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.260
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260
so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and he and she had exactly the relationship

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
She was the New Englander and abrasive,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and he was this courtly fellow.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
But really the most important question I ever asked,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
and most of the times when I talk about it,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:44.260
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
but I promise you it was the right question.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
This was to Agnes de Mille.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.260
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
transforming the American theater.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
An amazing woman.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.260
At the time that I proposed to her that --

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
but proposed to her that she come on.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
She said, "Come to my apartment."

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
She lived in New York.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.260
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
and then we'll decide whether we proceed."

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.260
And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
and she called out to me, and she was in bed.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
I had known that she had had a stroke,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
and that was some 10 years before.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
but -- I speak of the life force --

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
her hair was askew.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
And she was sitting there surrounded by books,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.260
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:59.260
was her will, which she had by her side.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.260
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.260
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.260
and I change it all the time

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
just because I want to."

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.260
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
She agreed.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
She was, of course, done up for the occasion,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.260
but this was a woman in great physical distress.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
And we had a conversation,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
and then I asked her this unthinkable question.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:52.260
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
And the audience just -- you know,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
they're always on the side of the interviewee,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
and they felt that this was a kind of assault,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
but this was the question she had

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
wanted somebody to ask her whole life.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.260
And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260
and she turned to the audience and

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.260
described herself as the fair demoiselle

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:25.260
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
and then she said, "And then puberty hit."

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
And she began to talk about things that had happened

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
to her body and her face,

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.260
and how she could no longer count on her beauty,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:43.260
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
for whom all the ballet lessons were given.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.260
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.260
and in that process, she made a number of decisions.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.260
First of all, was that dance, even though

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.260
it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
And secondly, she had better be,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
although she did dance for a while, a choreographer

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.260
because then her looks didn't matter.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:11.260
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.260
It was an amazing privilege to do this series.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:22.260
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
The key point was empathy

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.260
because everybody in their lives

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.260
is really waiting for people to ask them questions,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.260
so that they can be truthful about who they are

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.260
and how they became what they are,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.260
and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.260
Just be that way with your friends

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.260
and particularly the older members of your family.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
Thank you very much.
