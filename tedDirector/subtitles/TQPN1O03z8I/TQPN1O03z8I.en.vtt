00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
It's a simple idea about nature.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I want to say a word for nature

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.330
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.330
and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.330
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
and to the other species on whom we depend.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.330
looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
but I've tried to take it to some new places.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
Let me tell you where I got it.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.330
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
it was the first week of May --

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
they're just white clouds above.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
I was here, planting my chunks,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
cutting up potatoes and planting it,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
and the bees were working on this tree;

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And one of the things I really like about gardening

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
is that it doesn't take all your concentration,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
working alongside that bumblebee,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.330
was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
How was our role in this garden similar and different?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.330
both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
thought we were calling the shots.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant --

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was --

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
brought it, and I was planting it.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.330
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.330
I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
But that day, it occurred to me:

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
but we know better.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.330
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits --

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.330
color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.330
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
and also picking up some powder on its leg,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
and going off to the next blossom.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
The bee is not calling the shots.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And I realized then, I wasn't either.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
I had been seduced by that potato and not another

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.330
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
but as a co-evolutionary development

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.330
in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.330
figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
The competition of grasses, right?

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And suddenly everything looked different.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book;

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.330
this was a book about gardening --

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.330
that lawns were nature under culture's boot,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
that they were totalitarian landscapes,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
and never letting it set seed or die or have sex.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
And that's what the lawn was.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.330
I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
who they compete with for sunlight."

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
which in New England happens very, very quickly.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
So I started looking at things this way

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.330
And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.330
and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees --

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.330
that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry --

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.330
a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.330
And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit --

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
is what does it get us?

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.330
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.330
Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.330
rather than its destruction?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
And I would submit that this idea does this.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.330
besides some entertaining insights about human desire.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.330
As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
helps us deal with this weird anomaly,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.330
which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.330
which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.330
We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
we figured out we are just one species among many;

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.330
evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
we are acted upon as well as acting;

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.330
we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
none of us really believes this.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.330
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes --

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.330
who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
that the world is divided into subjects and objects;

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
that there is nature on one side, culture on another.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.330
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.330
you realize that the real literary conceit is that --

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.330
is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.330
the idea that consciousness is everything --

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
and that's another very important thing it does.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Looking at the world from other species' points of view

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.330
You suddenly realize that consciousness --

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
which we value and we consider

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
the crowning achievement of nature,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
But, you know, there's a comedian who said,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.330
"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Well, consciousness."

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.330
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
and they're just as interesting.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
I'll give you two examples, also from the garden:

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.330
lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
and summons another species of mite

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:50.330
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
they have biochemistry.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.330
And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.330
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.330
and we came out with only 23,000.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:21.330
Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
So who's the more sophisticated species?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.330
Well, we're all equally sophisticated.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
We've been evolving just as long,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
just along different paths.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:39.330
So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.330
is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.330
help us think ecologically.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
Now, the other use of this is practical.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.330
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.330
to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:21.330
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.330
(Laughter)

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
and there will be that much more habitat

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
So it helped me understand industrial agriculture,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
which of course is a Cartesian system.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
or the fuel or whatever we want.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
I went looking for a farm where these ideas

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.330
And that is this:

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
the farm is called Polyface, which means ...

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:35.330
such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
what else does he have?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
are all performing ecological services for one another,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
and they take care of pests for one another.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:59.330
and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.330
And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
this is a different way to think about nature

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
So, one day, cattle in a pen.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
relatively new, hooked to a car battery;

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
He waits three days,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards --

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
but it houses 350 chickens.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:55.330
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.330
turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
clucking, gossiping as chickens will --

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.330
and they make a beeline for the cow patties.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
And what they're doing is very interesting:

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
they're digging through the cow patties

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.330
for the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And the reason he's waited three days

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.330
is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and he'll have a huge fly problem.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:29.330
But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.330
and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
and in the process they're spreading the manure out.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.330
Very useful second ecosystem service.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
And third, while they're in this paddock

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
they are, of course, defecating madly

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
They then move out to the next one,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:07.330
and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.330
like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.330
So, it's a very productive system.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.330
he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
an immense amount of food.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.330
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
again, give each species what it wants,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.330
let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Put that in play.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
What happens to the grass when you do this?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:01.330
When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
and it immediately does something very interesting.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.330
and plants need to keep the root mass

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.330
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
And the species in the soil go to work

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them --

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:34.330
the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
This is how soil is created.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.330
It's created from the bottom up.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
This is how the prairies were built,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
the relationship between bison and grasses.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
And what I realized when I understood this --

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.330
he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.330
because grass is really the keystone species of such a system --

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:08.330
is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:14.330
which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
More for us, less for nature.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.330
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.330
there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
There are a lot of farmers doing this today.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
This is well beyond organic agriculture,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.330
which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:45.330
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:52.330
take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.330
-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.330
which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time --

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.330
that we can take the food we need from the Earth

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.330
and actually heal the Earth in the process.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.330
This is a way to reanimate the world,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.330
When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.330
the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
are something to be very hopeful about.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:26.330
Thank you very much.
