00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Well, this is 2009.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
are anxious to celebrate this.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
on almost every aspect

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
of Darwin and his life,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
and how he changed our thinking.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I say almost every aspect,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
because there is one aspect of this story

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
which they have thrown no light on.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
and to talk about something else.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
So I'm going to talk about it.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
very, very closely related.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
there's a chimp, there's a man;

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
they're astoundingly different,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
no resemblance at all.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
about culture or psychology, or behavior.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
measurable physical differences.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
They, that one,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
is hairy and walking on four legs.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
That one is a naked biped. Why?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
I mean --

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
(Laughter)

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
there's a reason for that.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
If we changed so much, something must have happened.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
What happened?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Everybody knew the answer.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
They knew what happened.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
our ancestors went out onto the plain.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
That explained everything.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
or to chase after animals,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
or to free our hands for weapons.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And we got so overheated in the chase

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Everybody knew that, for generations.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
at the accompanying microfauna

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
And they weren't savanna species.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
fossilized pollen.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
Shock, horror.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
Some of it even came from lianas,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So we're left with a situation where

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
we know that our earliest ancestors

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
were moving around on four legs in the trees,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160
before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
This is not something I've made up.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
It's not a minority theory.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Everybody agrees with it.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
and spoke to University College London.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
forget about it. It was wrong.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
We've got to go back to square one and start again."

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.160
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
You've got this beautiful paradigm.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
You've believed it through generations.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Nobody has questioned it.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
And now it's whipped away from under you.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
Well, we know the answer because

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Thomas S. Kuhn

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
wrote a seminal treatise

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
about this back in 1962.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
He said what scientists do

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
when a paradigm fails

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
(Laughter)

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
So they say, "Yes it's wrong,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
but supposing it was right ..."

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
(Laughter)

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160
And the only other option open to them

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
is to stop asking the questions.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
So that is what they have done now.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
It's what we ought to be doing.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Aaron Filler from Harvard said,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
And we just record what we see."

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
He knew all about that kind of science.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
And he called it hypothesis-free science.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
And if you're going to say,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
And the irony of it is,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
There was one waiting in the wings.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
It had been waiting there since 1960

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
said, "I think what happened,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
perhaps our ancestors

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
had a more aquatic existence

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
for some of the time."

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
He kept it to himself for 30 years.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
You've exposed us to public ridicule!

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
You must never do that again."

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And at that time, it became set in stone:

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
the aquatic theory should be dumped

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
with the UFOs and the yetis,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
as part of the lunatic fringe of science.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Well I don't think that.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
I'd like to talk about just a handful

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
of what have been called the

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
hallmarks of mankind,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
the things that made us different from everybody else,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
and all our relatives.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Let's look at our naked skin.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
It's obvious that most of the things we think about

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.160
the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
could that be why we are naked?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
I mean, look at the elephant.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
So back in 1982 I said,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
Peals of merry laughter!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.160
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
have aquatic ancestors.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.160
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.160
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
because look at the sea otter.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
But you can say

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
that every animal that has become naked

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
And take bipedality.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.160
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
are capable of walking on two legs,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
if they want to, for a short time.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
There is only one circumstance in which they

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
always, all of them, walk on two legs,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and that is when they are wading through water.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Do you think that's significant?

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
David Attenborough thinks it's significant,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Look at the fat layer.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
Why should it be there?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
the fat that in most land mammals

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
is deposited inside the body wall,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.160
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
has started to migrate to the outside,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
In the whale it's complete:

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
We cannot avoid the suspicion

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
that in our case it's started to happen.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
We have got skin lined with this layer.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
It's the only possible explanation of why humans,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
if they're very unlucky,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
can become grossly obese,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
The question of why we can speak.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
We can speak.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.160
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.160
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
are the diving animals and the diving birds.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.160
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
Trying to imagine a diver

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Try to imagine a gorilla

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
performing the same maneuver,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
and you can see that, compared with gorilla,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.160
this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
and it is not lunatic fringe.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
And the ironic thing about it is that

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
they are not staving off the aquatic theory

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
to protect a theory of their own,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
which they've all agreed on, and they love.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
There is nothing there.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
They are staving off the aquatic theory

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
to protect a vacuum.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
(Laughter)

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.160
(Applause)

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
How do they react when I say these things?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
is, "But it was investigated.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160
when Hardy put forward his article."

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
I don't believe it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
of any incident of that kind,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
It's never been done.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
I ask people sometimes, and they say,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
"I like the aquatic theory!

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
They say "Well ...

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:32.160
(Applause)

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And if you've got a scientific problem like that,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
you can't solve it by holding a head count,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160
(Laughter)

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
Some of them have come over.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
Anybody else out there? Come on in.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
The water is lovely.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
(Applause)

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And now we've got to look to the future.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.160
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
That would be very sad.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
The second thing that could happen

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
is that some young genius will arrive,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and say, "I've found it.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
No sign of that happening either.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
I don't think there is a third option.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
So the third thing that might happen is

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
a very beautiful thing.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
If you look back at the early years of the last century,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.160
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
between the believers in Mendel,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
and the believers in Darwin.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
It ended with a new synthesis:

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
blending together.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And I think the same thing will happen here.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
You'll get a new synthesis.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
will be blended together.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
And we can move forward from there,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
and really get somewhere.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
That would be a beautiful thing.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:36.160
(Laughter)

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.160
(Laughter)

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
what's holding it up?

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
I can tell you that in three words.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.160
Academia says no.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
They decided in 1960,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
And it's not easy to change their minds.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
The professional journals

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
won't touch it with a barge pole.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
The textbooks don't mention it.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
let alone look for a reason to it.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
won't touch it with a barge pole.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
So we never hear the case put for it,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
except in jocular references

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
to people on the lunatic fringe.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.160
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
Somebody up there

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
is issuing the commandment,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
And if you hope to make progress in this profession,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.160
and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
because it will get in your way."

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
So I get the impression that some parts

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
of the scientific establishment

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
are morphing into a kind of priesthood.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
But you know, that makes me feel good,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
because Richard Dawkins has told us

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
how to treat a priesthood.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
(Laughter)

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
all the excessive awe and reverence

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
it's been trained to receive."

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Right. I'll go ahead with that.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
And secondly, he says,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
I'll go along with that too.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
Thank you very much.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:17:04.160
(Applause)
