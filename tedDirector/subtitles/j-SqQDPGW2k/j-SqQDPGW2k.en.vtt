00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.075
This is a tuberculosis ward,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.916
and at the time this picture was taken
in the late 1800s,

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.556
one in seven of all people

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.340
died from tuberculosis.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.540
We had no idea
what was causing this disease.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.196
The hypothesis was actually

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.476
it was your constitution
that made you susceptible.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.236
And it was a highly romanticized disease.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.076
It was also called consumption,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.236
and it was the disorder of poets

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.996
and artists and intellectuals.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.756
And some people actually thought
it gave you heightened sensitivity

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.980
and conferred creative genius.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.836
By the 1950s,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.436
we instead knew
that tuberculosis was caused

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.836
by a highly contagious
bacterial infection,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.036
which is slightly less romantic,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.316
but that had the upside

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.676
of us being able to maybe
develop drugs to treat it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.716
So doctors had discovered
a new drug, iproniazid,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.116
that they were optimistic
might cure tuberculosis,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.916
and they gave it to patients,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.716
and patients were elated.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.236
They were more social, more energetic.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.860
One medical report actually says
they were "dancing in the halls."

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.116
And unfortunately,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.860
this was not necessarily
because they were getting better.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.620
A lot of them were still dying.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.260
Another medical report describes them
as being "inappropriately happy."

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.820
And that is how the first
antidepressant was discovered.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.036
So accidental discovery
is not uncommon in science,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.196
but it requires more
than just a happy accident.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.660
You have to be able to recognize it
for discovery to occur.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.236
As a neuroscientist,
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.676
about my firsthand experience

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.916
with whatever you want to call
the opposite of dumb luck --

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.556
let's call it smart luck.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.300
But first, a bit more background.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.116
Thankfully, since the 1950s,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.116
we've developed some other drugs
and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.795
And at least in the United States,
though not necessarily in other countries,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.316
we have closed our sanitoriums

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.020
and probably most of you
are not too worried about TB.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.556
But a lot of what was true
in the early 1900s

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.436
about infectious disease,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.100
we can say now
about psychiatric disorders.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.836
We are in the middle
of an epidemic of mood disorders

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.620
like depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.156
One in four of all adults
in the United States

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.660
suffers from mental illness,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.316
which means that if you haven't
experienced it personally

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.636
or someone in your family hasn't,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.916
it's still very likely
that someone you know has,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.580
though they may not talk about it.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.516
Depression has actually now surpassed

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.396
HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.676
as the leading cause
of disability worldwide.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.316
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.396
we don't know what causes it.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.356
Once it's developed, it's chronic,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.876
lasts a lifetime,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.220
and there are no known cures.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.876
The second antidepressant we discovered,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.356
also by accident, in the 1950s,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.580
from an antihistamine
that was making people manic,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.060
imipramine.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.876
And in both the case of the tuberculosis
ward and the antihistamine,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.596
someone had to be able to recognize

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.036
that a drug that was designed
to do one thing --

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.636
treat tuberculosis
or suppress allergies --

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.396
could be used to do
something very different --

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.620
treat depression.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.396
And this sort of repurposing
is actually quite challenging.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.356
When doctors first saw
this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.836
they didn't really recognize
what they saw.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.716
They were so used to thinking about it

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.516
from the framework
of being a tuberculosis drug

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.596
that they actually just listed it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.396
as a side effect, an adverse side effect.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.571
As you can see here,

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:17.620
a lot of these patients in 1954
are experiencing severe euphoria.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.516
And they were worried
that this might somehow interfere

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.396
with their recovering from tuberculosis.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.676
So they recommended that iproniazid
only be used in cases of extreme TB

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.380
and in patients that were
highly emotionally stable,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.116
which is of course the exact opposite
of how we use it as an antidepressant.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.596
They were so used to looking at it
from the perspective of this one disease,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.540
they could not see the larger implications
for another disease.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.076
And to be fair,
it's not entirely their fault.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.876
Functional fixedness
is a bias that affects all of us.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.356
It's a tendency to only
be able to think of an object

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.980
in terms of its traditional
use or function.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.636
And mental set is another thing. Right?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.676
That's sort of this preconceived framework

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.476
with which we approach problems.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.756
And that actually makes repurposing
pretty hard for all of us,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.316
which is, I guess, why they gave
a TV show to the guy who was,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.140
like, really great at repurposing.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.540
(Laughter)

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.516
So the effects in both the case
of iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.916
they were so strong --

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.156
there was mania,
or people dancing in the halls.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.316
It's actually not that surprising
they were caught.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.820
But it does make you wonder
what else we've missed.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.196
So iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.636
they're more than just
a case study in repurposing.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.636
They have two other things in common
that are really important.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.156
One, they have terrible side effects.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.796
That includes liver toxicity,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.796
weight gain of over 50 pounds,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.596
suicidality.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.796
And two, they both
increase levels of serotonin,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.156
which is a chemical signal in the brain,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.380
or a neurotransmitter.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.876
And those two things together,
right, one or the two,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.516
may not have been that important,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.276
but the two together meant
that we had to develop safer drugs,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.820
and that serotonin seemed
like a pretty good place to start.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.556
So we developed drugs
to more specifically focus on serotonin,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.236
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.996
the most famous of which is Prozac.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.996
And that was 30 years ago,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.220
and since then we have mostly
just worked on optimizing those drugs.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.956
And the SSRIs, they are better
than the drugs that came before them,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.076
but they still have a lot of side effects,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.996
including weight gain, insomnia,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.220
suicidality --

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.436
and they take a really long time to work,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.996
something like four to six weeks
in a lot of patients.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.196
And that's in the patients
where they do work.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.076
There are a lot of patients
where these drugs don't work.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.476
And that means now, in 2016,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.316
we still have no cures
for any mood disorders,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.396
just drugs that suppress symptoms,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.476
which is kind of the difference between
taking a painkiller for an infection

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.916
versus an antibiotic.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.796
A painkiller will make you feel better,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.900
but is not going to do anything
to treat that underlying disease.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.036
And it was this flexibility
in our thinking

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.996
that let us recognize
that iproniazid and imipramine

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.116
could be repurposed in this way,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.116
which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.140
which we then, ironically, fixated on.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.516
This is brain signaling, serotonin,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.796
from an SSRI commercial.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.180
In case you're not clear,
this is a dramatization.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.716
And in science, we try
and remove our bias, right,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.116
by running double-blinded experiments

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.836
or being statistically agnostic
as to what our results will be.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.156
But bias creeps in more insidiously
in what we choose to study

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.900
and how we choose to study it.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.836
So we've focused on serotonin now
for the past 30 years,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.100
often to the exclusion of other things.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.220
We still have no cures,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.596
and what if serotonin
isn't all there is to depression?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.676
What if it's not even the key part of it?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.876
That means no matter how much time

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.636
or money or effort we put into it,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.580
it will never lead to a cure.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.076
In the past few years,
doctors have discovered

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.020
probably what is the first truly new
antidepressant since the SSRIs,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.836
Calypsol,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.316
and this drug works very quickly,
within a few hours or a day,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.236
and it doesn't work on serotonin.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.940
It works on glutamate,
which is another neurotransmitter.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.876
And it's also repurposed.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.980
It was traditionally used
as anesthesia in surgery.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.196
But unlike those other drugs,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.036
which were recognized pretty quickly,

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.756
it took us 20 years

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.436
to realize that Calypsol
was an antidepressant,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.316
despite the fact that it's actually
a better antidepressant,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.956
probably, than those other drugs.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.076
It's actually probably because of the fact
that it's a better antidepressant

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.995
that it was harder for us to recognize.

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:54.100
There was no mania to signal its effects.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.676
So in 2013, up at Columbia University,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.276
I was working with my colleague,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.276
Dr. Christine Ann Denny,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.100
and we were studying Calypsol
as an antidepressant in mice.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.476
And Calypsol has, like,
a really short half-life,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.556
which means it's out of your body
within a few hours.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.996
And we were just piloting.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.276
So we would give an injection to mice,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.596
and then we'd wait a week,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.300
and then we'd run
another experiment to save money.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.156
And one of the experiments I was running,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.836
we would stress the mice,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.076
and we used that as a model of depression.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.436
And at first it kind of just looked
like it didn't really work at all.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.980
So we could have stopped there.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.436
But I have run this model
of depression for years,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.356
and the data just looked kind of weird.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.236
It didn't really look right to me.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.476
So I went back,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.996
and we reanalyzed it

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.836
based on whether or not they had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.060
a week beforehand.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.956
And it looked kind of like this.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.116
So if you look at the far left,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.636
if you put a mouse in a new space,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.916
this is the box, it's very exciting,

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.076
a mouse will walk around and explore,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.396
and you can see that pink line
is actually the measure of them walking.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.596
And we also give it
another mouse in a pencil cup

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.676
that it can decide to interact with.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.916
This is also a dramatization,
in case that's not clear.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.636
And a normal mouse will explore.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.900
It will be social.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.996
Check out what's going on.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.916
If you stress a mouse
in this depression model,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.220
which is the middle box,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.996
they aren't social, they don't explore.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.300
They mostly just kind of hide
in that back corner, behind a cup.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.116
Yet the mice that had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol,

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.340
here on your right,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.020
they were exploring, they were social.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.220
They looked like they
had never been stressed at all,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.220
which is impossible.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.980
So we could have just stopped there,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.076
but Christine had also used
Calypsol before as anesthesia,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.676
and a few years ago she had seen

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.076
that it seemed to have
some weird effects on cells

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.316
and some other behavior

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.356
that also seemed to last
long after the drug,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.636
maybe a few weeks.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.916
So we were like, OK,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.116
maybe this is not completely impossible,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.636
but we were really skeptical.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.196
So we did what you do in science
when you're not sure,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.420
and we ran it again.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.476
And I remember being in the animal room,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.156
moving mice from box to box
to test them,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.796
and Christine was actually sitting
on the floor with the computer in her lap

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.236
so the mice couldn't see her,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.516
and she was analyzing
the data in real time.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.916
And I remember us yelling,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.236
which you're not supposed to do
in an animal room where you're testing,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.836
because it had worked.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.236
It seemed like these mice
were protected against stress,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.316
or they were inappropriately happy,
however you want to call it.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.780
And we were really excited.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.300
And then we were really skeptical,
because it was too good to be true.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.060
So we ran it again.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.476
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.916
and we ran it again
in a physiological model,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.156
where all we did was give stress hormones.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.796
And we had our undergrads run it.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.940
And then we had our collaborators
halfway across the world in France run it.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.996
And every time someone ran it,
they confirmed the same thing.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.836
It seemed like
this one injection of Calypsol

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.620
was somehow protecting
against stress for weeks.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.036
And we only published this a year ago,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.140
but since then other labs
have independently confirmed this effect.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.860
So we don't know what causes depression,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.156
but we do know that stress
is the initial trigger

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.516
in 80 percent of cases,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.756
and depression and PTSD
are different diseases,

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.796
but this is something
they share in common.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.636
Right? It is traumatic stress

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.556
like active combat or natural disasters

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.036
or community violence or sexual assault

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.340
that causes post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:44.596
and not everyone that is exposed to stress
develops a mood disorder.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.516
And this ability to experience
stress and be resilient

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.700
and bounce back and not develop
depression or PTSD

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.756
is known as stress resilience,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.636
and it varies between people.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.996
And we have always thought of it
as just sort of this passive property.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.556
It's the absence of susceptibility factors

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.660
and risk factors for these disorders.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.500
But what if it were active?

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.916
Maybe we could enhance it,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.100
sort of akin to putting on armor.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.820
We had accidentally discovered
the first resilience-enhancing drug.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.516
And like I said, we only gave
a tiny amount of the drug,

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.116
and it lasted for weeks,

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.356
and that's not like anything
you see with antidepressants.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.700
But it is actually kind of similar
to what you see in immune vaccines.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.116
So in immune vaccines,
you'll get your shots,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.516
and then weeks, months, years later,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.876
when you're actually exposed to bacteria,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.356
it's not the vaccine in your body
that protects you.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.756
It's your own immune system

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.916
that's developed resistance and resilience
to this bacteria that fights it off,

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.076
and you actually never get the infection,

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.156
which is very different
from, say, our treatments. Right?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.996
In that case, you get the infection,
you're exposed to the bacteria,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.876
you're sick, and then you take,
say, an antibiotic which cures it,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.140
and those drugs are actually working
to kill the bacteria.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.276
Or similar to as I said before,
with this palliative,

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.156
you'll take something
that will suppress the symptoms,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.876
but it won't treat
the underlying infection,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.236
and you'll only feel better
during the time in which you're taking it,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.196
which is why you have to keep taking it.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.916
And in depression and PTSD --

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.916
here we have your stress exposure --

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.556
we only have palliative care.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.076
Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.956
and that is why you basically
have to keep taking them

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.676
for the life of the disease,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.900
which is often
the length of your own life.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.156
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing
drugs "paravaccines,"

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.716
which means vaccine-like,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.236
because it seems
like they might have the potential

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.076
to protect against stress

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.516
and prevent mice from developing

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.300
depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.220
Also, not all antidepressants
are also paravaccines.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.916
We tried Prozac as well,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.300
and that had no effect.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.076
So if this were to translate into humans,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.676
we might be able to protect people

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.956
who are predictably at risk

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.836
against stress-induced disorders
like depression and PTSD.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.996
So that's first responders
and firefighters,

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.156
refugees, prisoners and prison guards,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.260
soldiers, you name it.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.020
And to give you a sense
of the scale of these diseases,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.676
in 2010, the global burden of disease

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.540
was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.596
and since they are chronic,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.836
that cost is compounding
and is therefore expected to rise

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.100
up to six trillion dollars
in just the next 15 years.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.039
As I mentioned before,

00:15:46.064 --> 00:15:50.140
repurposing can be challenging
because of our prior biases.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.380
Calypsol has another name,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.300
ketamine,

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.940
which also goes by another name,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.876
Special K,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.300
which is a club drug and drug of abuse.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.636
It's still used across the world
as an anesthetic.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.516
It's used in children.
We use it on the battlefield.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.516
It's actually the drug of choice
in a lot of developing nations,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.396
because it doesn't affect breathing.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.100
It is on the World Health Organization
list of most essential medicines.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.140
If we had discovered ketamine
as a paravaccine first,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.676
it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.556
but as is, we have to compete
with our functional fixedness

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.380
and mental set that kind of interfere.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.556
Fortunately, it's not
the only compound we have discovered

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.020
that has these prophylactic,
paravaccine qualities,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.900
but all of the other drugs
we've discovered,

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.956
or compounds if you will,
they're totally new,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.596
they have to go through
the entire FDA approval process --

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.196
if they make it before
they can ever be used in humans.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.876
And that will be years.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.156
So if we wanted something sooner,

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.556
ketamine is already FDA-approved.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.276
It's generic, it's available.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.460
We could develop it for a fraction
of the price and a fraction of the time.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.756
But actually, beyond
functional fixedness and mental set,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.356
there's a real other challenge
to repurposing drugs,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.579
which is policy.

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:20.395
There are no incentives in place

00:17:20.419 --> 00:17:24.155
once a drug is generic and off patent
and no longer exclusive

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:26.516
to encourage pharma companies
to develop them,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.969
because they don't make money.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.500
And that's not true for just ketamine.
That is true for all drugs.

00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:38.236
Regardless, the idea itself
is completely novel in psychiatry,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.156
to use drugs to prevent mental illness

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.540
as opposed to just treat it.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.796
It is possible that 20, 50,
100 years from now,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.916
we will look back now
at depression and PTSD

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.156
the way we look back
at tuberculosis sanitoriums

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.380
as a thing of the past.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.420
This could be the beginning of the end
of the mental health epidemic.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.580
But as a great scientist once said,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.156
"Only a fool is sure of anything.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.220
A wise man keeps on guessing."

00:18:16.044 --> 00:18:17.284
Thank you, guys.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.846
(Applause)
