00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.856
There's a man out there, somewhere,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.856
who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.256
or at least he did 20 years ago.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.096
I don't know anything else about him,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.016
except that he once saved my life

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.680
by putting his own life in danger.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.976
This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.776
to bring me back to safety

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.576
after a car accident
that could have killed me.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.256
And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.256
but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.920
to understand why he did it,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.536
what forces within him
caused him to make the choice

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.416
that I owe my life to,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.056
to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.120
In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.856
But first let me tell you what happened.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.336
That night, I was 19 years old

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.736
and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.576
down the Interstate 5 freeway,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.136
when a little dog
darted out in front of my car.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.496
And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.880
which is swerve to avoid it.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.920
And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.056
I hit the dog anyways,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.696
and that sent the car into a fishtail,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.296
and then a spin across the freeway,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.896
until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.856
faced backwards into oncoming traffic

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.240
and then the engine died.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.040
And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.096
but I didn't

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.856
because of the actions
of that one brave man

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.376
who must have made the decision

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.416
within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.696
to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.656
in the dark

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.656
to save my life.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.576
And then after he got my car working again

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.216
and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.776
he drove off again.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.136
He never even told me his name,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.320
and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.376
So before I go any further,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.856
I really want to take a moment

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.680
to stop and say thank you
to that stranger.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.000
(Applause)

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.136
I tell you all of this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.376
because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.016
I became a psychology researcher,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.816
and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.176
Where does it come from,
and how does it develop,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.440
and what are the extreme forms
that it can take?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.296
These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.560
of human social nature.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.416
A lot of people,
and this includes everybody

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.336
from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.616
believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.816
that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.136
But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.656
do selfless things,
like helping other people

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.120
at enormous risk and cost to themselves?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.176
Answering this question

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.296
requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.696
and what might make people
who engage in such acts

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.576
different than other people.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.680
But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.736
The actions of the man who rescued me

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.736
meet the most stringent
definition of altruism,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.376
which is a voluntary, costly behavior

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.840
motivated by the desire
to help another individual.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.760
So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.120
What could possibly
explain an action like that?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.056
One answer is compassion, obviously,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.880
which is a key driver of altruism.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.136
But then the question becomes,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.920
why do some people
seem to have more of it than others?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.016
And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.240
are different in fundamental ways.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.016
But to figure out how,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160
I actually started from the opposite end,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.360
with psychopaths.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.776
A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.816
like the desire to help other people,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.976
is to study people
in whom that desire is missing,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.120
and psychopaths are exactly such a group.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.576
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.696
with strongly genetic origins,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.616
and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.164
and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.296
Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.935
conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.096
of psychopathic adolescents,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.976
and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.296
have shown that people
who are psychopathic

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.240
pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.776
First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.576
they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.816
And in particular,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.736
they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.456
And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.096
and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.376
in people who see them,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.096
so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.240
also tend to be insensitive to these cues.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.736
The part of the brain

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.656
that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.936
is called the amygdala.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.376
There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.256
and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.656
And whereas healthy adults and children

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.296
usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.456
when they look at fearful expressions,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.616
psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.296
Sometimes they don't react at all,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.940
which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.376
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.000
by about 18 or 20 percent.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.736
So all of these findings
are reliable and robust,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.216
and they're very interesting.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.896
But remember that my main interest

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.456
is not understanding
why people don't care about others.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.040
It's understanding why they do.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.176
So the real question is,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.456
could extraordinary altruism,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.696
which is the opposite of psychopathy

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.136
in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.176
emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.440
A sort of antipsychopathic brain,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.976
better able to recognize
other people's fear,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.416
an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280
and maybe larger than average as well?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.936
As my research has now shown,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.416
all three things are true.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.696
And we discovered this

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.736
by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.416
These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.640
to a complete stranger.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.696
So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.336
so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.416
and transplanted into a very ill stranger

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.480
that they've never met and may never meet.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.840
"Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.896
And the answer may be

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.176
that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.000
have certain special characteristics.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.256
They are better at recognizing
other people's fear.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.696
They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.376
This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.336
And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.696
was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.616
And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.856
by about eight percent.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.616
So together, what these data suggest

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.256
is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.816
that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.336
and at the other by people
who are very compassionate

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.280
and driven to acts of extreme altruism.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.696
But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.416
is not just that they're
more compassionate than average.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.656
They are,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.576
but what's even more unusual about them

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.696
is that they're compassionate
and altruistic

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.656
not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.656
of friends and family. Right?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.936
Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.160
is not extraordinary.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.216
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.456
even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.416
to people who are outside
their social circle altogether,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.976
total strangers,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.600
just like the man who rescued me.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.456
And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.856
how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.216
that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.736
And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.816
I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.816
when so many other people don't?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.256
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.896
who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.760
What is it that makes you so special?"

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.680
And what do they say?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.320
They say, "Nothing.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.976
There's nothing special about me.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.799
I'm just the same as everybody else."

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.296
And I think that's actually
a really telling answer,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.160
because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.216
they look more like this.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.480
They have no center.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.736
These altruists literally
don't think of themselves

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.016
as being at the center of anything,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.000
as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.216
When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.960
she said, "Because it's not about me."

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.776
Another said,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.056
"I'm not different. I'm not unique.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.416
Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you."

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.536
I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.416
is humility,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.536
which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.080
makes men as angels.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.816
And why is that?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.616
It's because if there's
no center of your circle,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.176
there can be no inner rings
or outer rings,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.096
nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.320
than anybody else.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.416
And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.680
from the average person.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.976
But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.976
and maybe even most people.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.256
And I think this
because at the societal level,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.000
expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.376
The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.656
that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.136
of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.216
which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.760
from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.296
And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.416
A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.936
how normal and ordinary it is

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.256
for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.920
to complete strangers today.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.816
Is it possible that
a hundred years from now

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.416
people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.896
is just as normal and ordinary

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.936
as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.160
Maybe.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.696
So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.496
In part it seems to be

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.720
increases in wealth
and standards of living.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.336
As societies become
wealthier and better off,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.976
people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.856
and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.600
from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.416
But all of these changes also yield

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.656
a strange and paradoxical result,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.216
which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.456
which it is,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.176
there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.240
and more cruel, which it's not.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.896
And I don't know exactly why this is,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.496
but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.696
about the suffering
of strangers in distant places,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.136
and so we now care a lot more

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.360
about the suffering
of those distant strangers.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.936
But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.416
that the roots of altruism and compassion

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.456
are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.176
maybe even more so,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.256
and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.376
to the suffering of distant others,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.176
I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.976
from the center of the circle

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.056
and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.880
is within reach for almost everyone.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.296
Thank you.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.898
(Applause)
