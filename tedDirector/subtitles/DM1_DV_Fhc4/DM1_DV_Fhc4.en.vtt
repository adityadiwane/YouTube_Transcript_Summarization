00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
I'd like to start by asking you all
to go to your happy place, please.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.640
Yes, your happy place,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.600
I know you've got one even if it's fake.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.840
(Laughter)

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.160
OK, so, comfortable?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.400
Good.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.393
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer
the following questions.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.480
Is there any strip lighting
in your happy place?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.640
Any plastic tables?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.360
Polyester flooring?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.200
Mobile phones?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.720
No?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.665
I think we all know that our happy place

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.480
is meant to be
somewhere natural, outdoors --

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.119
on a beach, fireside.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.680
We'll be reading or eating or knitting.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.640
And we're surrounded
by natural light and organic elements.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.280
Natural things make us happy.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
And happiness is a great motivator;
we strive for happiness.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.800
Perhaps that's why
we're always redesigning everything,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.520
in the hopes that our solutions
might feel more natural.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.320
So let's start there --

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.760
with the idea that good design
should feel natural.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.319
Your phone is not very natural.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.576
And you probably think
you're addicted to your phone,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.840
but you're really not.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.280
We're not addicted to devices,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.400
we're addicted to the information
that flows through them.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.640
I wonder how long you would be
happy in your happy place

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.800
without any information
from the outside world.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.806
I'm interested in how we access
that information,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.840
how we experience it.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.880
We're moving from a time
of static information,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.880
held in books and libraries and bus stops,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.160
through a period of digital information,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.440
towards a period of fluid information,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.680
where your children will expect to be able
to access anything, anywhere at any time,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.600
from quantum physics
to medieval viticulture,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.480
from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.840
just like switching on a lightbulb --

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.080
Imagine that.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.800
Humans also like simple tools.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.440
Your phone is not a very simple tool.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.120
A fork is a simple tool.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.360
(Laughter)

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.199
And we don't like them made of plastic,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.907
in the same way I don't really like
my phone very much --

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:26.531
it's not how I want
to experience information.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.560
I think there are better solutions
than a world mediated by screens.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000
I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.040
and I don't think any of us feel that good

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.720
about how much time
we spend slouched over them.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.400
Fortunately,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.202
the big tech companies seem to agree.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.960
They're actually heavily invested
in touch and speech and gesture,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.760
and also in senses --

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520
things that can turn
dumb objects, like cups,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.360
and imbue them with the magic
of the Internet,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.760
potentially turning this digital cloud

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.360
into something we might touch and move.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.480
The parents in crisis over screen time

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.640
need physical digital toys
teaching their kids to read,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.440
as well as family-safe app stores.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.680
And I think, actually,
that's already really happening.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.760
Reality is richer than screens.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.560
For example, I love books.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.440
For me they are time machines --
atoms and molecules bound in space,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.440
from the moment of their creation
to the moment of my experience.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000
But frankly,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.400
the content's identical on my phone.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.760
So what makes this
a richer experience than a screen?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.400
I mean, scientifically.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.280
We need screens, of course.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.640
I'm going to show film,
I need the enormous screen.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.400
But there's more than you can do
with these magic boxes.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.640
Your phone is not
the Internet's door bitch.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.880
(Laughter)

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.760
We can build things --
physical things,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.280
using physics and pixels,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.987
that can integrate the Internet
into the world around us.

00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.531
And I'm going to show you
a few examples of those.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.400
A while ago, I got to work
with a design agency, Berg,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.240
on an exploration of what the Internet
without screens might actually look like.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.320
And they showed us a range ways

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.279
that light can work with simple senses
and physical objects

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.600
to really bring the Internet to life,
to make it tangible.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.960
Like this wonderfully mechanical
YouTube player.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.960
And this was an inspiration to me.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.520
Next I worked with
the Japanese agency, AQ,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.880
on a research project into mental health.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.301
We wanted to create an object

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:53.040
that could capture the subjective data
around mood swings

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.480
that's so essential to diagnosis.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.120
This object captures your touch,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.000
so you might press it
very hard if you're angry,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.160
or stroke it if you're calm.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.800
It's like a digital emoji stick.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.000
And then you might revisit
those moments later,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.760
and add context to them online.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.640
Most of all,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.160
we wanted to create
an intimate, beautiful thing

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.120
that could live in your pocket

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.360
and be loved.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.896
The binoculars are actually
a birthday present

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.063
for the Sydney Opera House's
40th anniversary.

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:29.040
Our friends at Tellart in Boston
brought over a pair of street binoculars,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.557
the kind you might find
on the Empire State Building,

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.400
and they fitted them with 360-degree views

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.040
of other iconic world heritage sights --

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.760
(Laughter)

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800
using Street View.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.880
And then we stuck them under the steps.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.600
So, they became this very physical,
simple reappropriation,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.680
or like a portal to these other icons.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.640
So you might see Versailles
or Shackleton's Hut.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.720
Basically, it's virtual
reality circa 1955.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.800
(Laughter)

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.880
In our office we use
hacky sacks to exchange URLs.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.680
This is incredibly simple,
it's like your Opal card.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.480
You basically put a website
on the little chip in here,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.040
and then you do this and ... bosh! --

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.400
the website appears on your phone.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.920
It's about 10 cents.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.056
Treehugger is a project
that we're working on

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.480
with Grumpy Sailor and Finch,
here in Sydney.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.400
And I'm very excited
about what might happen

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.240
when you pull the phones apart
and you put the bits into trees,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.160
and that my children
might have an opportunity

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.800
to visit an enchanted forest
guided by a magic wand,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.840
where they could talk to digital fairies
and ask them questions,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.080
and be asked questions in return.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.320
As you can see,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360
we're at the cardboard stage
with this one.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.560
(Laughter)

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.800
But I'm very excited

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.720
by the possibility of getting kids
back outside without screens,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.680
but with all the powerful magic
of the Internet at their fingertips.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.840
And we hope to have something like this
working by the end of the year.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.280
So let's recap.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840
Humans like natural solutions.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.920
Humans love information.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.240
Humans need simple tools.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.600
These principles should underpin
how we design for the future,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.520
not just for the Internet.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.680
You may feel uncomfortable about the age
of information that we're moving into.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.160
You may feel challenged,
rather than simply excited.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200
Guess what? Me too.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.080
It's a really extraordinary period
of human history.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.680
We are the people
that actually build our world,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.966
there are no artificial intelligences...

00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.415
yet.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.320
(Laughter)

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.760
It's us -- designers, architects,
artists, engineers.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.280
And if we challenge ourselves,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.240
I think that actually
we can have a happy place

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.760
filled with the information we love

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.600
that feels as natural and as simple
as switching on lightbulb.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.355
And although it may seem inevitable,

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:11.720
that what the public wants
is watches and websites and widgets,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.920
maybe we could give a bit of thought
to cork and light and hacky sacks.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.280
Thank you very much.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.720
(Applause)
