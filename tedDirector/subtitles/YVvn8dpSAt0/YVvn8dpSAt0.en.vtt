00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.136
We're going to go on a dive
to the deep sea,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.136
and anyone that's had
that lovely opportunity

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.841
knows that for about
two and half hours on the way down,

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.560
it's a perfectly positively
pitch-black world.

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:27.576
And we used to see the most mysterious
animals out the window

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.963
that you couldn't describe:

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.586
these blinking lights -- a world
of bioluminescence, like fireflies.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.743
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean
Research and Conservation Association --

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.526
was able to come up with a camera

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.036
that could capture some
of these incredible animals,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.436
and that's what you're seeing
here on the screen.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.353
That's all bioluminescence.
Like I said: just like fireflies.

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:48.632
There's a flying turkey under a tree.

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:49.666
(Laughter)

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.838
I'm a geologist by training.

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:54.314
But I love that.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.589
And you see, some of the bioluminescence
they use to avoid being eaten,

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.136
some they use to attract prey,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.911
but all of it,
from an artistic point of view,

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:04.336
is just positively amazing.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.136
And a lot of what goes on inside --

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.494
There's a fish with glowing eyes,
pulsating eyes.

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:11.136
Some of the colors
are designed to hypnotize,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.620
these lovely patterns.

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.136
And then this last one,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.136
one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.136
Just absolutely amazing,
every single dive.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.223
That's the unknown world,
and today we've only explored

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.973
about 3 percent
of what's out there in the ocean.

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:29.603
Already we've found
the world's highest mountains,

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:31.136
the world's deepest valleys,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.237
underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.547
a lot of that we shared
with you from the stage.

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.236
And in a place
where we thought no life at all,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.836
we find more life, we think,
and diversity and density

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.343
than the tropical rainforest,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.392
which tells us that we don't know
much about this planet at all.

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:46.745
There's still 97 percent,

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.870
and either that 97 percent is empty
or just full of surprises.

00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:51.945
But I want to jump up to shallow water now

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.655
and look at some creatures
that are positively amazing.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.236
Cephalopods -- head-foots.

00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:59.512
As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.613
(Laughter)

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:01.836
This is an octopus.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.037
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon
at the Marine Biological Lab,

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.236
and it's just fascinating
how cephalopods can,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.814
with their incredible eyes,
sense their surroundings,

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.614
look at light, look at patterns.

00:02:11.638 --> 00:02:14.136
Here's an octopus moving across the reef,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.961
finds a spot to settle down, curls up
and then disappears into the background.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:19.886
Tough thing to do.

00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:23.436
In the next bit, we're going
to see a couple squid.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.133
Now males, when they fight,

00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:27.334
if they're really aggressive,
they turn white.

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:28.936
And these two males are fighting.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.033
They do it by bouncing
their butts together,

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:32.677
which is an interesting concept.

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.436
Now, here's a male on the left
and a female on the right,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.136
and the male has managed
to split his coloration

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.213
so the female only always sees
the kinder, gentler squid in him.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:45.136
(Laughter)

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.136
Let's take a look at it again.
Watch the coloration:

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.136
white on the right, brown on the left.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.871
He takes a step back,

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:56.609
he's keeping off the other
males by splitting his body,

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.336
and comes up on the other side --

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.424
Bingo!

00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:02.501
Now, I'm told that's not not just
a squid phenomenon with males,

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:03.775
but I don't know.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.136
(Laughter)

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.058
Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:08.946
This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.442
And there he is,
his droopy little eyes up here.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.398
But they can do
pretty amazing things, too.

00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:18.136
Here we're going to see
one backing into a crevice,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.136
and watch his tentacles --

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.136
he just pulls them in,
makes them look just like algae.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.334
Disappears right into the background.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:27.827
Positively amazing.

00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.251
Here's two males fighting.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.736
Once again, they're smart enough,
these cephalopods;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.336
they know not to hurt each other.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.236
But look at the patterns
that they can do with their skin.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.136
That's an amazing thing.

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:40.956
Here's an octopus.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.412
Sometimes they don't want
to be seen when they move,

00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:44.946
because predators can see them.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.046
This guy can make himself
look like a rock,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.246
and, looking at his environment,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.265
can actually slide across the bottom,

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.266
using the waves and the shadows
so he can't be seen.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.603
His motion blends
right into the background --

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.660
the moving rock trick.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.436
So, we're learning
lots new from the shallow water.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.637
Still exploring the deep,
but learning lots from the shallow water.

00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:07.924
There's a good reason why:

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:10.860
the shallow water's full of predators
-- here's a barracuda --

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.936
and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.136
you need to really understand
how to use your surroundings to hide.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.937
In the next scene, you're going to see
a nice coral bottom.

00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:21.001
And you see that an octopus
would stand out

00:04:21.025 --> 00:04:23.608
very easily there if you couldn't
use your camouflage,

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:25.733
use your skin to change color and texture.

00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:28.136
Here's some algae in the foreground --

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.911
and an octopus.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:32.335
Ain't that amazing?

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:38.136
Now, Roger spooked him,
so he took off in a cloud of ink,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.136
and when he lands, the octopus says,
"Oh, I've been seen.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.637
The best thing to do is to get
as big as I can get."

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.136
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.137
So, he's bluffing.
Let's do it backwards.

00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.737
I thought he was joking
when he first showed it to me.

00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:53.422
I thought it was all graphics.
So here it is in reverse.

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:55.636
Watch the skin color;
watch the skin texture.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.336
Just an amazing animal,
it can change color and texture

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.694
to match the surroundings.

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:02.136
Watch him blend right into this algae.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.136
One, two, three.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.901
(Applause)

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:12.901
And now he's gone, and so am I.
Thank you very much.

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:15.925
(Applause)
