00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:17.083
It was November 1, 2002,

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.958
my first day as a principal,

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:26.469
but hardly my first day
in the school district of Philadelphia.

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:30.176
I graduated from
Philadelphia public schools,

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.375
and I went on to teach
special education for 20 years

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:37.792
in a low-income, low-performing school

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:39.783
in North Philadelphia,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:41.875
where crime is rampant

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.625
and deep poverty is
among the highest in the nation.

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.559
Shortly after I walked into my new school,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:54.500
a huge fight broke out among the girls.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.025
After things were quickly under control,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.518
I immediately called a meeting

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.809
in the school's auditorium

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:08.768
to introduce myself
as the school's new principal.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:11.708
(Applause)

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.333
I walked in angry,

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:16.522
a little nervous --

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:17.684
(Laughter) --

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.458
but I was determined

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.292
to set the tone for my new students.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.917
I started listing as forcefully as I could

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.600
my expectations for their behavior

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:34.083
and my expectations
for what they would learn in school.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.125
When, all of a sudden,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.042
a girl way in the back of the auditorium,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.042
she stood up

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.625
and she said, "Miss!

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:46.792
Miss!"

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.500
When our eyes locked, she said,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.868
"Why do you keep calling this a school?

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.375
This is not a school."

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.417
In one outburst,

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.583
Ashley had expressed what I felt

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.917
and never quite was able to articulate

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:14.893
about my own experience
when I attended a low-performing school

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:18.750
in the same neighborhood,
many, many, many years earlier.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.625
That school was definitely not a school.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.875
Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:35.625
I was entering my third
low-performing school as principal.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.625
I was to be Strawberry Mansion's
fourth principal in four years.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.125
It was labeled "low-performing
and persistently dangerous"

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.601
due to its low test scores

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.351
and high number of weapons,

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.917
drugs, assaults and arrests.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.726
Shortly as I approached the door
of my new school

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.518
and attempted to enter,

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:06.750
and found the door locked with chains,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:10.851
I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.833
going, "Miss! Miss!

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.958
This is not a school."

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.958
The halls were dim and dark
from poor lighting.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.018
There were tons of piles
of broken old furniture

00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:27.309
and desks in the classrooms,

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.833
and there were thousands
of unused materials and resources.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.042
This was not a school.

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.083
As the year progressed,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.125
I noticed that the classrooms
were nearly empty.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.042
The students were just scared:

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.750
scared to sit in rows in fear
that something would happen;

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:56.333
scared because they were often teased
in the cafeteria for eating free food.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:04:01.417
They were scared from all the fighting
and all the bullying.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:05.250
This was not a school.

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:10.101
And then, there were the teachers,

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:14.375
who were incredibly afraid
for their own safety,

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:20.476
so they had low expectations
for the students and themselves,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.809
and they were totally
unaware of their role

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.042
in the destruction
of the school's culture.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.541
This was the most troubling of all.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.625
You see, Ashley was right,

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.708
and not just about her school.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.809
For far too many schools,

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.893
for kids who live in poverty,

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.750
their schools are really
not schools at all.

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:47.292
But this can change.

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.625
Let me tell you how it's being done
at Strawberry Mansion High School.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:57.375
Anybody who's ever worked
with me will tell you

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.958
I am known for my slogans.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.625
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.530
So today, I am going to use three

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:08.887
that have been paramount
in our quest for change.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.667
My first slogan is:

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.833
if you're going to lead, lead.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.870
I always believed

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:21.768
that what happens in a school
and what does not happen in a school

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:23.250
is up to the principal.

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.417
I am the principal,

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:29.458
and having that title required me to lead.

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.822
I was not going to stay in my office,

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:35.667
I was not going to delegate my work,

00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:39.136
and I was not going to be afraid
to address anything

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.060
that was not good for children,

00:05:41.084 --> 00:05:44.058
whether that made me liked or not.

00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:46.941
I am a leader,

00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:50.063
so I know I cannot do anything alone.

00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:53.451
So, I assembled
a top-notch leadership team

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:56.559
who believed in the possibility
of all the children,

00:05:56.583 --> 00:06:00.432
and together, we tackled the small things,

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:05.059
like resetting every single
locker combination by hand

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:07.997
so that every student
could have a secure locker.

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:12.015
We decorated every
bulletin board in that building

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.892
with bright, colorful,
and positive messages.

00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:18.555
We took the chains off
the front doors of the school.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.674
We got the lightbulbs replaced,

00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:23.854
and we cleaned
every classroom to its core,

00:06:23.878 --> 00:06:28.353
recycling every, every textbook
that was not needed,

00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:32.307
and discarded thousands
of old materials and furniture.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:35.568
We used two dumpsters per day.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:39.432
And, of course, of course,

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:41.392
we tackled the big stuff,

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:45.779
like rehauling the entire school budget

00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:50.658
so that we can reallocate funds
to have more teachers and support staff.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:57.268
We rebuilt the entire
school day schedule from scratch

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:01.171
to add a variety of start and end times,

00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:04.347
remediation, honors courses,

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:08.392
extracurricular activities,
and counseling,

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.249
all during the school day.

00:07:11.717 --> 00:07:13.650
All during the school day.

00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:19.208
We created a deployment plan

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:26.121
that specified where every single
support person and police officer would be

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:27.549
every minute of the day,

00:07:27.573 --> 00:07:31.476
and we monitored
at every second of the day,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.275
and, our best invention ever,

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:37.933
we devised a schoolwide
discipline program

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.692
titled "Non-negotiables."

00:07:40.137 --> 00:07:41.841
It was a behavior system --

00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:48.775
designed to promote
positive behavior at all times.

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.317
The results?

00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:55.213
Strawberry Mansion was removed
from the Persistently Dangerous List

00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:57.676
our first year after being --

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.613
(Applause) --

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.215
after being on the Persistently
Dangerous List for five consecutive years.

00:08:08.732 --> 00:08:12.732
Leaders make the impossible possible.

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:15.993
That brings me to my second slogan:

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:19.467
So what? Now what?

00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:20.573
(Laughter)

00:08:20.597 --> 00:08:24.875
(Applause)

00:08:25.483 --> 00:08:27.317
When we looked at the data,

00:08:27.718 --> 00:08:29.788
and we met with the staff,

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:31.726
there were many excuses

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.683
for why Strawberry Mansion was
low-performing and persistently dangerous.

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:40.996
They said that only 68 percent of the kids
come to school on a regular basis,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.049
100 percent of them live in poverty,

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:47.506
only one percent
of the parents participate,

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:49.804
many of the children

00:08:49.828 --> 00:08:53.376
come from incarceration
and single-parent homes,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.704
39 percent of the students
have special needs,

00:08:57.728 --> 00:09:00.140
and the state data revealed

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.993
that six percent of the students
were proficient in algebra,

00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:07.993
and 10 were proficient in literature.

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:14.743
After they got through
telling us all the stories

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:18.726
of how awful the conditions
and the children were,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.442
I looked at them,

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:24.520
and I said, "So what. Now what?

00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:26.891
What are we gonna do about it?"

00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:29.874
(Applause)

00:09:32.654 --> 00:09:37.908
Eliminating excuses at every turn
became my primary responsibility.

00:09:38.552 --> 00:09:41.614
We addressed every one of those excuses

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.194
through a mandatory
professional development,

00:09:44.194 --> 00:09:49.150
paving the way for intense focus
on teaching and learning.

00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:52.156
After many observations,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.875
what we determined was
that teachers knew what to teach

00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:00.226
but they did not know how to teach

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.217
so many children
with so many vast abilities.

00:10:03.798 --> 00:10:08.872
So, we developed a lesson
delivery model for instruction

00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:12.636
that focused on small group instruction,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.454
making it possible for all the students
to get their individual needs met

00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:18.779
in the classroom.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.383
The results?

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:25.802
After one year, state data revealed

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:30.137
that our scores have grown
by 171 percent in Algebra

00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:32.782
and 107 percent in literature.

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:35.767
(Applause)

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.582
We have a very long way to go,

00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:41.983
a very long way to go,

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:48.991
but we now approach every obstacle
with a "So What. Now What?" attitude.

00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:54.462
And that brings me
to my third and final slogan.

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.136
(Laughter)

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.989
If nobody told you they loved you today,

00:11:00.678 --> 00:11:04.285
you remember I do, and I always will.

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:06.875
My students have problems:

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:12.424
social, emotional and economic problems

00:11:12.448 --> 00:11:14.140
you could never imagine.

00:11:15.056 --> 00:11:17.394
Some of them are parents themselves,

00:11:17.418 --> 00:11:20.240
and some are completely alone.

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.893
If someone asked me my real secret

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:28.843
for how I truly keep
Strawberry Mansion moving forward,

00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:32.538
I would have to say
that I love my students

00:11:32.935 --> 00:11:35.403
and I believe in their possibilities

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:36.953
unconditionally.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.637
When I look at them,

00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:43.007
I can only see what they can become,

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:47.564
and that is because I am one of them.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:51.392
I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.

00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:57.378
I know what it feels like
to go to a school that's not a school.

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.434
I know what it feels like to wonder

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:05.108
if there's ever going to be
any way out of poverty.

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.946
But because of my amazing mother,

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:13.562
I got the ability to dream

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:16.168
despite the poverty that surrounded me.

00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:18.359
So --

00:12:18.383 --> 00:12:20.831
(Applause) --

00:12:20.855 --> 00:12:25.948
if I'm going to push my students

00:12:25.972 --> 00:12:28.745
toward their dream
and their purpose in life,

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:31.377
I've got to get to know who they are.

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:34.894
So I have to spend time with them,

00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:37.318
so I manage the lunchroom every day.

00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:38.631
(Laughter)

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:40.167
And while I'm there,

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:44.914
I talk to them
about deeply personal things,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.913
and when it's their birthday,

00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:49.866
I sing "Happy Birthday"

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.036
even though I cannot sing at all.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.092
(Laughter)

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:55.840
I often ask them,

00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:59.797
"Why do you want me to sing
when I cannot sing at all?"

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.659
(Laughter)

00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:03.867
And they respond by saying,

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.660
"Because we like feeling special."

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:11.062
We hold monthly town hall meetings

00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:14.541
to listen to their concerns,

00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:18.326
to find out what is on their minds.

00:13:18.784 --> 00:13:23.817
They ask us questions like,
"Why do we have to follow rules?"

00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:26.850
"Why are there so many consequences?"

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:30.135
"Why can't we just do what we want to do?"

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:32.390
(Laughter)

00:13:32.414 --> 00:13:36.175
They ask, and I answer
each question honestly,

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:42.907
and this exchange in listening
helps to clear up any misconceptions.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.392
Every moment is a teachable moment.

00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:50.175
My reward,

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:52.525
my reward

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:59.258
for being non-negotiable
in my rules and consequences

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.746
is their earned respect.

00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:03.967
I insist on it,

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:09.064
and because of this,
we can accomplish things together.

00:14:09.952 --> 00:14:13.567
They are clear about
my expectations for them,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.153
and I repeat those expectations
every day over the P.A. system.

00:14:19.656 --> 00:14:21.269
I remind them --

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.509
(Laughter)

00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:27.166
I remind them of those core values

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.818
of focus, tradition, excellence,

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:35.109
integrity and perseverance,

00:14:35.133 --> 00:14:37.631
and I remind them every day

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:41.447
how education can truly
change their lives.

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:45.054
And I end every announcement the same:

00:14:45.414 --> 00:14:49.267
"If nobody told you they loved you today,

00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:51.032
you remember I do,

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.026
and I always will."

00:14:54.076 --> 00:14:56.017
Ashley's words

00:14:56.893 --> 00:14:59.763
of "Miss, Miss,

00:15:00.224 --> 00:15:02.740
this is not a school,"

00:15:03.064 --> 00:15:05.646
is forever etched in my mind.

00:15:06.354 --> 00:15:11.782
If we are truly going
to make real progress

00:15:11.806 --> 00:15:13.774
in addressing poverty,

00:15:13.798 --> 00:15:15.942
then we have to make sure

00:15:16.442 --> 00:15:20.631
that every school
that serves children in poverty

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:23.260
is a real school,

00:15:23.284 --> 00:15:25.539
a school, a school --

00:15:25.563 --> 00:15:28.517
(Applause) --

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:33.240
a school that provides them with knowledge

00:15:33.264 --> 00:15:37.392
and mental training
to navigate the world around them.

00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:40.758
I do not know all the answers,

00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:47.075
but what I do know is for those
of us who are privileged

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:53.018
and have the responsibility of leading
a school that serves children in poverty,

00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:55.268
we must truly lead,

00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:58.917
and when we are faced
with unbelievable challenges,

00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:04.726
we must stop and ask ourselves,
"So what. Now what?

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.406
What are we going to do about it?"

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.549
And as we lead,

00:16:10.063 --> 00:16:11.968
we must never forget

00:16:12.677 --> 00:16:15.893
that every single one of our students

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.520
is just a child,

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.942
often scared by what the world
tells them they should be,

00:16:23.797 --> 00:16:29.782
and no matter what the rest
of the world tells them they should be,

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:33.414
we should always provide them with hope,

00:16:33.438 --> 00:16:35.984
our undivided attention,

00:16:36.656 --> 00:16:39.782
unwavering belief in their potential,

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:41.997
consistent expectations,

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:44.739
and we must tell them often,

00:16:45.117 --> 00:16:48.693
if nobody told them they loved them today,

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:51.538
remember we do, and we always will.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.057
Thank you.

00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:56.164
(Applause)

00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:05.408
Thank you, Jesus.
