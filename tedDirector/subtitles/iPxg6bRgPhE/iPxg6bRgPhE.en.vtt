00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.346
I want to talk to you today

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.633
about a difficult topic
that is close to me,

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:24.742
and closer than you might realize to you.

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:31.595
I came to the UK 21 years ago,
as an asylum-seeker.

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.599
I was 21.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.065
I was forced to leave
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.207
my home, where I was a student activist.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.934
I would love my children to be able
to meet my family in the Congo.

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.090
But I want to tell you
what the Congo has got to do with you.

00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.209
But first of all,
I want you to do me a favor.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.826
Can you all please reach into your pockets
and take out your mobile phone?

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.008
Feel that familiar weight ...

00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:16.850
how naturally your finger
slides towards the buttons.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:19.066
(Laughter)

00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:22.253
Can you imagine your world without it?

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:24.761
It connects us to our loved ones,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:28.404
our family, friends and colleagues,

00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:31.021
at home and overseas.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:33.783
It is a symbol of an interconnected world.

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:41.440
But what you hold in your hand
leaves a bloody trail,

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:44.222
and it all boils down to a mineral:

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.360
tantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.573
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor.

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:59.457
It stores energy in our mobile phones,
PlayStations and laptops.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:05.791
It is used in aerospace
and medical equipment as an alloy.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.492
It is so powerful
that we only need tiny amounts.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:14.684
It would be great
if the story ended there.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.123
Unfortunately, what you hold in your hand

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:24.860
has not only enabled incredible
technological development

00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:27.717
and industrial expansion,

00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:32.483
but it has also contributed
to unimaginable human suffering.

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:36.055
Since 1996,

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.749
over five million people have died
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:49.095
Countless women, men and children
have been raped, tortured or enslaved.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.139
Rape is used as a weapon of war,

00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:57.972
instilling fear
and depopulating whole areas.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.586
The quest for extracting this mineral

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.269
has not only aided, but it has fueled

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:10.950
the ongoing war in the Congo.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:14.886
But don't throw away your phones yet.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:20.015
Thirty thousand children are enlisted

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.189
and are made to fight in armed groups.

00:03:25.418 --> 00:03:29.375
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.435
in global health and poverty rankings.

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.380
But remarkably,

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:41.100
the UN Environmental Programme
has estimated the wealth of the country

00:03:41.124 --> 00:03:46.167
to be over 24 trillion dollars.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:55.145
The state-regulated mining
industry has collapsed,

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.834
and control over mines has splintered.

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:02.306
Coltan is easily controlled
by armed groups.

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:08.490
One well-known illicit trade route
is that across the border to Rwanda,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:12.320
where Congolese tantalum
is disguised as Rwandan.

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:16.117
But don't throw away your phones yet,

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:18.974
because the incredible irony

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:22.342
is that the technology
that has placed such unsustainable,

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.371
devastating demands on the Congo

00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:31.641
is the same technology that has brought
this situation to our attention.

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:36.981
We only know so much about the situation
in the Congo and in the mines

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:41.724
because of the kind of communication
the mobile phone allows.

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:45.763
As with the Arab Spring,

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:49.124
during the recent elections in the Congo,

00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:55.197
voters were able to send text messages
of local polling stations

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:58.689
to the headquarters
in the capital, Kinshasa.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.266
And in the wake of the result,

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:08.984
the diaspora has joined
with the Carter Center,

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.365
the Catholic Church and other observers,

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.904
to draw attention
to the undemocratic result.

00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:22.907
The mobile phone has given
people around the world

00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.208
an important tool towards gaining
their political freedom.

00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:33.212
It has truly revolutionized the way
we communicate on the planet.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:38.396
It has allowed momentous
political change to take place.

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:43.933
So, we are faced with a paradox.

00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:49.806
The mobile phone
is an instrument of freedom

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.927
and an instrument of oppression.

00:05:55.275 --> 00:06:01.646
TED has always celebrated
what technology can do for us,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.201
technology in its finished form.

00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:10.067
It is time to be asking questions
about technology.

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:11.702
Where does it come from?

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:13.678
Who makes it?

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.229
And for what?

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:21.242
Here, I am speaking directly to you,

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.005
the TED community,

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.821
and to all those who might
be watching on a screen,

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:30.198
on your phone, across the world,

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:31.578
in the Congo.

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:37.007
All the technology is in place
for us to communicate,

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:40.694
and all the technology is in place
to communicate this.

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.895
At the moment,

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.407
there is no clear fair-trade solution.

00:06:50.547 --> 00:06:53.415
But there has been
a huge amount of progress.

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:57.555
The US has recently passed legislation

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:01.403
to target bribery
and misconduct in the Congo.

00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:05.336
Recent UK legislation
could be used in the same way.

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:13.241
In February, Nokia unveiled its new policy
on sourcing minerals in the Congo,

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:20.133
and there is a petition to Apple
to make a conflict-free iPhone.

00:07:21.752 --> 00:07:26.113
There are campaigns spreading
across university campuses

00:07:26.137 --> 00:07:28.896
to make their colleges conflict-free.

00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:31.055
But we're not there yet.

00:07:31.753 --> 00:07:37.772
We need to continue
mounting pressure on phone companies

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:40.357
to change their sourcing processes.

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:45.510
When I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,

00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:46.848
I was homesick.

00:07:47.903 --> 00:07:51.976
I missed my family
and the friends I left behind.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:56.102
Communication was extremely difficult.

00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:00.431
Sending and receiving
letters took months --

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:01.961
if you were lucky.

00:08:01.985 --> 00:08:03.714
Often, they never arrived.

00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:10.775
Even if I could have afforded
the phone bills home,

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:13.191
like most people in the Congo,

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:16.230
my parents did not own a phone line.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.095
Today, my two sons --

00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:25.722
David and Daniel,

00:08:25.746 --> 00:08:30.312
can talk to my parents
and get to know them.

00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:35.963
Why should we allow

00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:42.882
such a wonderful, brilliant
and necessary product

00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:46.841
to be the cause of unnecessary suffering

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:48.055
for human beings?

00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:54.456
We demand fair-trade food
and fair-trade clothes.

00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:58.939
It is time to demand fair-trade phones.

00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:02.454
This is an idea worth spreading.

00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:04.271
Thank you.

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:10.727
(Applause)
