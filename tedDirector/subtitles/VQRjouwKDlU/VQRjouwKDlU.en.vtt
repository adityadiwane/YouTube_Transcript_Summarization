00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.416
The language I'm speaking right now

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.776
is on its way to becoming
the world's universal language,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.136
for better or for worse.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.376
Let's face it,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.256
it's the language of the internet,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.256
it's the language of finance,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.616
it's the language of air traffic control,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.016
of popular music,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.256
diplomacy --

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.720
English is everywhere.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.416
Now, Mandarin Chinese
is spoken by more people,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.936
but more Chinese people
are learning English

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.656
than English speakers
are learning Chinese.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.416
Last I heard,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.896
there are two dozen universities
in China right now

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.656
teaching all in English.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.080
English is taking over.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.376
And in addition to that,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.016
it's been predicted
that at the end of the century

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.016
almost all of the languages
that exist now --

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.296
there are about 6,000 --

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.216
will no longer be spoken.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.840
There will only be some hundreds left.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.976
And on top of that,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.576
it's at the point where
instant translation of live speech

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.720
is not only possible,
but it gets better every year.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.096
The reason I'm reciting
those things to you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.256
is because I can tell
that we're getting to the point

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.496
where a question
is going to start being asked,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.056
which is: Why should we
learn foreign languages --

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.056
other than if English
happens to be foreign to one?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.096
Why bother to learn another one
when it's getting to the point

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.600
where almost everybody in the world
will be able to communicate in one?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.376
I think there are a lot of reasons,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.736
but I first want to address

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.616
the one that you're probably
most likely to have heard of,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.976
because actually it's more
dangerous than you might think.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.736
And that is the idea

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.536
that a language channels your thoughts,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.936
that the vocabulary
and the grammar of different languages

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.776
gives everybody
a different kind of acid trip,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.016
so to speak.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.256
That is a marvelously enticing idea,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.576
but it's kind of fraught.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.056
So it's not that it's untrue completely.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.895
So for example, in French and Spanish

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:25.176
the word for table is,
for some reason, marked as feminine.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.136
So, "la table," "la mesa,"
you just have to deal with it.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.656
It has been shown

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.076
that if you are a speaker
of one of those languages

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.776
and you happen to be asked

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.856
how you would imagine a table talking,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.776
then much more often
than could possibly be an accident,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.496
a French or a Spanish speaker

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.376
says that the table would talk
with a high and feminine voice.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.536
So if you're French or Spanish,
to you, a table is kind of a girl,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.736
as opposed to if you
are an English speaker.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.576
It's hard not to love data like that,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.736
and many people
will tell you that that means

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.576
that there's a worldview that you have
if you speak one of those languages.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.896
But you have to watch out,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.376
because imagine if somebody
put us under the microscope,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.856
the us being those of us
who speak English natively.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.736
What is the worldview from English?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.496
So for example,
let's take an English speaker.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.816
Up on the screen, that is Bono.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.456
He speaks English.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.416
I presume he has a worldview.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.096
Now, that is Donald Trump.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.336
In his way,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.776
he speaks English as well.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.320
(Laughter)

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.856
And here is Ms. Kardashian,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.856
and she is an English speaker, too.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.656
So here are three speakers
of the English language.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.256
What worldview do those
three people have in common?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.376
What worldview is shaped through
the English language that unites them?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.216
It's a highly fraught concept.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.096
And so gradual consensus is becoming
that language can shape thought,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.576
but it tends to be in rather darling,
obscure psychological flutters.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.200
It's not a matter of giving you
a different pair of glasses on the world.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.016
Now, if that's the case,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.976
then why learn languages?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.536
If it isn't going to change
the way you think,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.160
what would the other reasons be?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.920
There are some.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.976
One of them is that if you
want to imbibe a culture,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.136
if you want to drink it in,
if you want to become part of it,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.056
then whether or not
the language channels the culture --

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.016
and that seems doubtful --

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.856
if you want to imbibe the culture,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.336
you have to control to some degree

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.696
the language that the culture
happens to be conducted in.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.416
There's no other way.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.936
There's an interesting
illustration of this.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.656
I have to go slightly obscure,
but really you should seek it out.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.016
There's a movie by the Canadian
film director Denys Arcand --

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.736
read out in English on the page,
"Dennis Ar-cand,"

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.096
if you want to look him up.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.176
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.336
And many of the characters

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.416
are vibrant, funny, passionate,
interesting French-Canadian,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.776
French-speaking women.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.256
There's one scene closest to the end,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.736
where they have to take a friend
to an Anglophone hospital.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.856
In the hospital,
they have to speak English.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.736
Now, they speak English
but it's not their native language,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.456
they'd rather not speak English.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.416
And they speak it more slowly,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.416
they have accents, they're not idiomatic.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.136
Suddenly these characters
that you've fallen in love with

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.560
become husks of themselves,
they're shadows of themselves.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.976
To go into a culture

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.016
and to only ever process people
through that kind of skrim curtain

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.936
is to never truly get the culture.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.736
And so to the extent that hundreds
of languages will be left,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.016
one reason to learn them

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.736
is because they are tickets
to being able to participate

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.016
in the culture of the people
who speak them,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.216
just by virtue of the fact
that it is their code.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.480
So that's one reason.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.736
Second reason:

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.176
it's been shown

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.136
that if you speak two languages,
dementia is less likely to set in,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.496
and that you are probably
a better multitasker.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.936
And these are factors that set in early,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.896
and so that ought to give you some sense

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.456
of when to give junior or juniorette
lessons in another language.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.896
Bilingualism is healthy.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.816
And then, third --

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.240
languages are just an awful lot of fun.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.536
Much more fun than we're often told.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.856
So for example,
Arabic: "kataba," he wrote,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.096
"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.136
"Uktub," write, in the imperative.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.056
What do those things have in common?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.176
All those things have in common

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.736
the consonants sitting
in the middle like pillars.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.216
They stay still,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.376
and the vowels
dance around the consonants.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.576
Who wouldn't want to roll
that around in their mouths?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.016
You can get that from Hebrew,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.696
you can get that from Ethiopia's
main language, Amharic.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.136
That's fun.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.576
Or languages have different word orders.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.816
Learning how to speak
with different word order

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.816
is like driving on the different side
of a street if you go to certain country,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.336
or the feeling that you get when you
put Witch Hazel around your eyes

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.696
and you feel the tingle.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.296
A language can do that to you.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.536
So for example,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.576
"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.096
a book that I'm sure
we all often return to,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.376
like "Moby Dick."

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.496
One phrase in it is,
"Do you know where I found him?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.176
Do you know where he was?
He was eating cake in the tub,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.416
Yes he was!"

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.776
Fine. Now, if you learn that
in Mandarin Chinese,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.056
then you have to master,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.336
"You can know, I did where him find?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.176
He was tub inside gorging cake,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.016
No mistake gorging chewing!"

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.256
That just feels good.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.576
Imagine being able to do that
for years and years at a time.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.936
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.976
Me either, but if I did,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.616
I would get to roll around in my mouth
not some baker's dozen of vowels

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.896
like English has,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.936
but a good 30 different vowels

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.856
scooching and oozing around
in the Cambodian mouth

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.216
like bees in a hive.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.760
That is what a language can get you.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.696
And more to the point,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.656
we live in an era when it's never been
easier to teach yourself another language.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.936
It used to be that you had
to go to a classroom,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.016
and there would be
some diligent teacher --

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.656
some genius teacher in there --

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.016
but that person was only
in there at certain times

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.296
and you had to go then,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.136
and then was not most times.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.560
You had to go to class.

00:08:40.974 --> 00:08:43.736
If you didn't have that,
you had something called a record.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.456
I cut my teeth on those.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.176
There was only so much data on a record,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.456
or a cassette,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.816
or even that antique object known as a CD.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.456
Other than that you had books
that didn't work,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.856
that's just the way it was.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.776
Today you can lay down --

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.256
lie on your living room floor,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.496
sipping bourbon,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.296
and teach yourself
any language that you want to

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.896
with wonderful sets
such as Rosetta Stone.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.056
I highly recommend
the lesser known Glossika as well.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.376
You can do it any time,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.000
therefore you can do it more and better.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.296
You can give yourself your morning
pleasures in various languages.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.056
I take some "Dilbert" in various
languages every single morning;

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.736
it can increase your skills.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.616
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.176
when the idea of having
any language you wanted

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.776
in your pocket,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.296
coming from your phone,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.040
would have sounded like science fiction
to very sophisticated people.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.336
So I highly recommend

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.336
that you teach yourself languages
other than the one that I'm speaking,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.536
because there's never been
a better time to do it.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.056
It's an awful lot of fun.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.896
It won't change your mind,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.096
but it will most certainly blow your mind.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.336
Thank you very much.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.161
(Applause)
