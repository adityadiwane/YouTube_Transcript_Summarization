00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.330
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:37.330
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
That is the call that chimpanzees make

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
before they go to sleep in the evening.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
from one group of nests to the next.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
from where Zeray left off yesterday.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.330
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.330
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
through DNA genetic profiling.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.330
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
It's kind of commonplace now,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.330
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And you can tell an awful lot

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
from the shape of the muscle attachments,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
something about the way they lived

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
from the various artifacts found with them.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.330
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
from that ancient, ancient past.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
you very often find people speculating about how early humans

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.330
They are more like us than any other living creature,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.330
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.330
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.330
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.330
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
And we believe that this long period of childhood

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
As the brain becomes ever more complex

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
during evolution in different forms of animals,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
in an individual's life history.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.330
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
And we believe that it's in this way

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
how these are passed from one generation to the next,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
through observation, imitation and practice,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.330
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
And they swagger and they throw rocks.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.330
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
precursors to love and true altruism.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.330
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.330
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
They are very territorially aggressive.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.330
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.330
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.330
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
as we make even more observations.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.330
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
have helped -- more than anything else --

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
This is just one photograph from the air,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.330
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.330
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and realized that outside the park, this forest,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
that a question came to my mind.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.330
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and over the lake from Congo.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:52.330
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.330
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
of the people living in the villages around the park.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.330
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
almost desert-like land up in these mountains.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
so that within two years they can again be productive.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
Most important of all, I believe,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.330
is working with small groups of women,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.330
providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
And we've got, as is the case around the world,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.330
about 95 percent of all loans returned.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Empowering women, working with education,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.330
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.330
as women's education improves, family size drops.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.330
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
And as a result of this program,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
something's happening for conservation.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:32.330
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
but when we began the TACARE program,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
asking what they were interested in.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
They began to understand

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.330
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
This is an area way outside the National Park,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
stretching out into all these very degraded lands.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And as these villages have a better standard of life,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
they are actually agreeing to put

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.330
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
so that once again, as the trees grow back,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
through which they can travel to interact --

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
as they must for genetic viability --

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
with other remnant groups outside the National Park.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
So TACARE is a success.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
around other wilderness areas

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
which are faced with extreme population pressure.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.330
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
are major problems.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
There is a great deal of poverty.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
And when you get large numbers of people

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.330
living in land that is not that fertile,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
particularly when you cut down trees,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.330
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
what's going to happen? Something's got to give.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
what are we doing to our planet?

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
said that if every person on this planet

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
we need three new planets.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.330
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.330
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
with this extraordinary brain,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
capable of the kind of technology

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.330
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
The indigenous people around the world,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
before they made a major decision,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
used to sit around and ask themselves,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
but the developed world --

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
major decisions involving millions of dollars,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
and millions of people, are often based on,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
And these decisions affect Africa.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
As I began traveling around Africa

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.330
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.330
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
talking in the United States, going to Asia.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.330
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
The earth is poisoning our foods.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.330
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
that we're going to face in this century --

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
industrial and household chemicals

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
that still are being sprayed around the world,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.330
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
The mangroves are being cut down;

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
We've talked about the soil erosion.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.330
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
leading to climate change.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
All around the world climates are mixed up.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
It's Africa that already is affected.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:54.330
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
who are too poor to buy food,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.330
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
as the last of the trees are cut down.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.330
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
So it wasn't surprising to me

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
that as I was traveling around the world

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.330
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.330
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
I asked a question. "Why?"

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.330
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
between this extraordinarily clever brain,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:51.330
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.330
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.330
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.330
And these young people, when I talk to them,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
basically they were either depressed or apathetic,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.330
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
and there's nothing we can do about it."

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
We have compromised their future.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.330
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
I feel this desperation.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
which began right here in Tanzania

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
environmental and social. It's a message of hope.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
The most important message of Roots and Shoots:

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.330
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.330
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.330
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:23.330
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
so that the poor have choice as well.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.330
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.330
It depends on how old they are, and which country,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.330
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.330
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:48.330
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
And every group chooses, between them,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
and impinge on each other.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.330
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.330
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
in other parts of the world.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.330
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
domestic animals as well.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.330
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.330
And woven throughout all of this is a message

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.330
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.330
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.330
between religions and between us and the natural world.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:41.330
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.330
We not do have more than this one planet.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.330
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.330
that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:57.330
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.330
South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.330
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.330
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.330
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.330
or just using them to feed their families,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.330
and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.330
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.330
with their vegetables and their chickens.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
It's being used in Uganda

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.330
to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.330
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.330
Once again, they're useful members of society.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.330
We have this program in prisons as well.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.330
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.330
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.330
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.330
with older kids talking to younger ones.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.330
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.330
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.330
"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.330
you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
from about one million, at the turn of the century,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.330
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.330
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.330
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.330
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.330
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.330
And I mean, think of the technologies.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:45.330
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.330
It's one of my hobbyhorses.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.330
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.330
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.330
Do we care about the planet for our children?

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.330
Do we care about their future?

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:10.330
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.330
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.330
What we buy. What we wear.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.330
And choose to make these choices with the question,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
how will this affect the environment around me?

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:29.330
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.330
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:36.330
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.330
and we join hands around the world.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.330
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:47.330
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.330
All of these technologies we can use.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.330
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.330
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.330
This change, this change. To see change

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.330
that we must have if we care about the future.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.330
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.330
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.330
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.330
And an example is the TACARE program.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.330
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.330
if you stop hacking them for firewood,

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.330
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.330
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.330
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.330
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.330
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.330
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.330
this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.330
the resilience of the human spirit,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.330
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.330
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:59.330
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.330
and take their part in changing the world.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.330
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.330
We could make a very long list,

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.330
but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.330
of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.330
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.330
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.330
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:33.330
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.330
People like this are so inspirational.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.330
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.330
And we need some environmental role models as well,

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.330
and I've been hearing some of them today.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:52.330
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.330
again, with everyone at TED.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:59.330
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.330
especially the Roots and Shoots program.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.330
And just a last word on that --

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.330
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.330
I met her today.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.330
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.330
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.330
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.330
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.330
and see just one example of how young people,

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:30.330
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.330
to make the world a better place,

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.330
truly are our hope for tomorrow.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.330
Thank you.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.330
(Applause)
