00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
about the rise of collaborative consumption.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm going to explain what it is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that this isn't a flimsy idea,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
or a short-term trend,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
but a powerful cultural and economic force

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
reinventing not just what we consume,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
but how we consume.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Hands up -- how many of you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
lying around your house

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that you probably won't use again,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Can't see all the hands,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but it looks like all of you, right?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
On our shelves at home,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
season six to be precise.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Now my husband, Chris, and I

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
love this show.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
you don't really want to watch it again,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So there it sits on our shelves

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
obsolete to us,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
but with immediate latent value to someone else.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I lived in New York for 10 years,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So how easily could I swap

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
our unwanted copy of "24"

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Now you may have noticed

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
is like an online dating service

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
for all your unwanted media.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
What it does is use the Internet

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
to create an infinite marketplace

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
to match person A's "haves"

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
with person C's "wants,"

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
whatever they may be.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
The other week, I went on one of these sites,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
appropriately called Swaptree,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and there were over 59,300 items

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that I could instantly swap

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
for my copy of "24."

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Lo and behold,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
who wanted swap his or her

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
for my copy of "24."

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So in other words, what's happening here

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
is that Swaptree

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in approximately 60 seconds.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
because it knows the way of the item.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Now there are layers of technical wonder

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
behind sites such as Swaptree,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
but that's not my interest,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and nor is swap trading, per se.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
dedicated to researching,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
inherent in these systems.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
When you think about it,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
whose real name I didn't know

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and without any money changing hands.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
happen successfully,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and the one percent that receive a negative rating,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
it's for relatively minor reasons,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
like the item didn't arrive on time.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
So what's happening here?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
An extremely powerful dynamic

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
that has huge commercial and cultural implications

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
is at play.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Namely, that technology

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is enabling

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
trust between strangers.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
We now live in a global village

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
where we can mimic the ties

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
that used to happen face to face,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
but on a scale and in ways

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that have never been possible before.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So what's actually happening

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is that social networks and real-time technologies

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
are taking us back.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We're bartering, trading,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
swapping, sharing,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
but they're being reinvented

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
into dynamic and appealing forms.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
What I find fascinating

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
is that we've actually wired our world to share,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
whether that's our neighborhood, our school,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
our office, or our Facebook network,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and that's creating an economy

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
of "what's mine is yours."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
From the mighty eBay,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
to social lending platforms such as Zopa,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that will take anyone in this audience

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
with 100 dollars to lend,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
we're sharing and collaborating again

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
in ways that I believe

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
are more hip than hippie.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now before I dig into the different systems

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
of collaborative consumption,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I'd like to try and answer the question

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that every author rightfully gets asked,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
which is, where did this idea come from?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
but actually it was a complicated web

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
of seemingly disconnected ideas.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Over the next minute,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
of all the dots that went on in my head.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
The first thing I began to notice:

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
how many big concepts were emerging --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
around how ridiculously easy it is

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to form groups for a purpose.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And linked to this crowd mania

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
were examples all around the world --

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
from the election of a president

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
on what the power of numbers could achieve.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Now, you know when you learn a new word,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and then you start to see that word everywhere?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
That's what happened to me

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
when I noticed that we are moving

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
from passive consumers

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to creators,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to highly enabled collaborators.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
What's happening

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
is the Internet is removing the middleman,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
so that anyone from a T-shirt designer

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
to a knitter

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
can make a living selling peer-to-peer.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And the ubiquitous force

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
of this peer-to-peer revolution

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I mean, it's amazing to think

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that, in every single minute of this speech,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
25 hours

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
of YouTube video will be loaded.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Now what I find fascinating about these examples

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is how they're actually tapping into

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
our primate instincts.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I mean, we're monkeys,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And we were doing so for thousands of years,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
whether it's when we hunted in packs,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
or farmed in cooperatives,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
before this big system called hyper-consumption came along

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and we built these fences

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and created out own little fiefdoms.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
But things are changing,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and one of the reasons why

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
They're growing up sharing --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
files, video games, knowledge.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
It's second nature to them.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
are like foot soldiers,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
The reason why it's happening so fast

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is because of mobile collaboration.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
We now live in a connected age

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
from a small device in our hands.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
All of this was going through my head

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
towards the end of 2008,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
when, of course, the great financial crash happened.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
and he poignantly commented

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
that 2008 is when we hit a wall,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
when Mother Nature and the market

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
both said, "No more."

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Now we rationally know

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
that an economy built on hyper-consumption

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
until actually I realized it was happening

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
because of four key drivers.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and real-time technologies,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
fundamentally changing the way we behave.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And four, a global recession

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
that has fundamentally shocked

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
consumer behaviors.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
These four drivers

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
are fusing together

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and creating the big shift --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
away from the 20th century,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
defined by hyper-consumption,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
towards the 21st century,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
defined by collaborative consumption.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
I generally believe we're at an inflection point

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
where the sharing behaviors --

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
through sites such as Flickr and Twitter

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that are becoming second nature online --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
to the way we grow food,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
we are consuming and collaborating once again.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
have actually gathered thousands of examples

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
from all around the world of collaborative consumption.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And although they vary enormously

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
in scale, maturity and purpose,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
when we dived into them,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
The first is redistribution markets.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and move it from where it's not needed

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
to somewhere, or someone, where it is.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
and redistribute --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
because they stretch the life cycle of a product

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and thereby reduce waste.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The second is collaborative lifestyles.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
This is the sharing of resources

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
of things like money, skills and time.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
I bet, in a couple of years,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that phrases like "coworking"

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
is called Landshare.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
It's a scheme in the U.K.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that matches Mr. Jones,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
with some spare space in his back garden,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Together they grow their own food.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
you wonder why it's never been done before.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Now, the third system

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
is product-service systems.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
what it does for you --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
without needing to own the product outright.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
This idea is particularly powerful

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
for things that have

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
high-idling capacity.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And that can be anything from baby goods

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
to fashions to --

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
how many of you have a power drill,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
own a power drill? Right.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
in its entire lifetime.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
(Laughter)

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
It's kind of ridiculous, right?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
(Laughter)

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
(Applause)

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
So why don't you rent the drill,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and make some money from it?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
These three systems are coming together,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
allowing people to share resources

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
without sacrificing their lifestyles,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
or their cherished personal freedoms.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
I'm not asking people

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
to share nicely in the sandpit.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
So I want to just give you an example

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
of how powerful collaborative consumption can be

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
to change behaviors.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
The average car

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Yet, that car sits idle

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
for 23 hours a day.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
So when you consider these two facts,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
it starts to make a little less sense

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
that we have to own one outright.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
So this is where car-sharing companies

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
In 2009,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Zipcar took 250 participants

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
from across 13 cities --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and they're all self-confessed car addicts

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and car-sharing rookies --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and got them to surrender their keys for a month.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Instead, these people had to walk,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
bike, take the train,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
or other forms of public transport.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
They could only use their Zipcar membership

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
when absolutely necessary.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
The results of this challenge after just one month

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
was staggering.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
just from the extra exercise.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
But my favorite statistic

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
is that 100

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
out of the 250 participants

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
did not want their keys back.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
In other words, the car addicts

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
had lost their urge to own.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Now products-service systems have been around for years.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
But I think they're entering a new age,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
because technology makes sharing

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
frictionless and fun.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
that said, "Sharing is to ownership

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
what the iPod is to the 8-track,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
what solar power is to the coal mine."

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
I believe also, our generation,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
our relationship to satisfying what we want

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
is far less tangible

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
than any other previous generation.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
I don't want a clunky answering machine;

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
I want the message it saves.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
In other words, I don't want stuff;

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
This is fueling a massive shift

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
from where usage trumps possessions --

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
"where access is better than ownership."

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Now as our possessions

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
dematerialize into the cloud,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
a blurry line is appearing

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
between what's mine, what's yours,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and what's ours.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
I want to give you one example

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that shows how fast this evolution is happening.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
This represents an eight-year time span.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
We've gone from traditional car-ownership

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
to ride-sharing platforms that match rides

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
where you can actually make money

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
to your neighbor.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Now all of these systems

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
require a degree of trust,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
and the cornerstone to this working

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
is reputation.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Now in the old consumer system,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
our reputation didn't matter so much,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
because our credit history was far more important

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
that any kind of peer-to-peer review.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
With every spammer we flag,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
with every idea we post, comment we share,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and whether we can or can't be trusted.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Let's go back to my first example,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Swaptree.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
I can see that Rondoron

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
has completed 553 trades

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
with a 100 percent success rate.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
In other words, I can trust him or her.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Now mark my words,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
it's only a matter of time

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
and see a cumulative picture

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
of our reputation capital.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And this reputation capital

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
will determine our access to collaborative consumption.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
It's a new social currency, so to speak,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
that could become as powerful as our credit rating.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Now as a closing thought,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
I believe we're actually in a period

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
where we're waking up

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
from this humongous hangover

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
of emptiness and waste,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and we're taking a leap

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to create a more sustainable system

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
built to serve our innate needs

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
for community and individual identity.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
I believe it will be referred to

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
as a revolution, so to speak --

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
when society, faced with great challenges,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
made a seismic shift

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
from individual getting and spending

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
towards a rediscovery of collective good.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
Because I really believe

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
it can disrupt outdated modes of business,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
help us leapfrog

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and teach us when enough really is enough.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Thank you very much.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
(Applause)
