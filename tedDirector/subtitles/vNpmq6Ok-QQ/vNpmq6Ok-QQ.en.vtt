00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:17.795
Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.057
You know that all over the world,

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:22.852
people fight for their freedom,

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:25.058
fight for their rights.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.219
Some battle oppressive governments.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.955
Others battle oppressive societies.

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.811
Which battle do you think is harder?

00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:39.283
Allow me to try to answer this question

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:42.363
in the few coming minutes.

00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:48.179
Let me take you back two years ago in my life.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.135
It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.

00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.819
He was five at the time.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.259
After finishing his bedtime rituals,

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.341
he looked at me and he asked a question:

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:03.572
"Mommy, are we bad people?"

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:06.032
I was shocked.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:09.189
"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.524
Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:14.107
on his face when he came from school.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.073
He wouldn't tell me what happened.

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:20.136
[But now] he was ready to tell.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:22.947
"Two boys hit me today in school.

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:26.316
They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:31.102
You and your mom should be put in jail.'"

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:34.243
I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:38.947
I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.162
But those questioning eyes of my son

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:43.987
were my moment of truth,

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.740
when it all came together.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.158
You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:54.293
for driving a car in a country

00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:59.248
where women are not supposed to drive cars.

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:01.639
Just for giving me his car keys,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.495
my own brother was detained twice,

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:07.108
and he was harassed to the point he had

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:09.096
to quit his job as a geologist,

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:12.430
leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.528
My father had to sit in a Friday sermon

00:02:14.528 --> 00:02:18.200
listening to the imam condemning women drivers

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.168
and calling them prostitutes

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.504
amongst tons of worshippers,

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:26.816
some of them our friends and family of my own father.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:30.400
I was faced with an organized defamation campaign

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.382
in the local media combined with false rumors

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:36.240
shared in family gatherings, in the streets

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.984
and in schools.

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:41.328
It all hit me.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.522
It came into focus that those kids

00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:45.816
did not mean to be rude to my son.

00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:49.886
They were just influenced by the adults around them.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:53.355
And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:57.169
for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.018
It was a punishment for daring to challenge

00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:03.715
the society's rules.

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:08.252
But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.

00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:12.048
Allow me to give you a briefing

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:14.240
about my story.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.276
It was May, 2011,

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:18.235
and I was complaining to a work colleague

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:20.069
about the harassments I had to face

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.857
trying to find a ride back home,

00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:25.341
although I have a car and an international driver's license.

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:27.466
As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.952
have been always complaining about the ban,

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:32.368
but it's been 20 years since anyone

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:34.400
tried to do anything about it,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.600
a whole generation ago.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.736
He broke the good/bad news in my face.

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:41.893
"But there is no law banning you from driving."

00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:44.097
I looked it up, and he was right.

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:46.776
There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.916
It was just a custom and traditions

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:52.932
that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.936
and imposed on women.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.024
That realization ignited the idea of June 17,

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:00.465
where we encouraged women to take the wheel

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:03.193
and go drive.

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:07.048
It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:10.254
"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."

00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:12.920
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.520
she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.134
she drove a car and she announced

00:04:17.134 --> 00:04:18.863
but she didn't record a video.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.723
We needed proof.

00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:23.584
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.

00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:25.495
And to my surprise,

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:28.384
it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.090
What happened next, of course?

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.984
I started receiving threats

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:36.546
to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:40.158
The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:42.338
That really creeped us out.

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:44.465
I was in the campaign with other Saudi women

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:46.418
and even men activists.

00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:48.882
We wanted to know how the authorities

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:52.490
would respond on the actual day, June 17,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.219
when women go out and drive.

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.277
So this time I asked my brother

00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:58.368
to come with me and drive by a police car.

00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:01.122
It went fast. We were arrested,

00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:04.806
signed a pledge not to drive again, released.

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:08.018
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,

00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:10.281
and I was sent to jail.

00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:11.906
I wasn't sure why I was sent there,

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:15.083
because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:17.370
But what I was sure of was my innocence.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.835
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:23.711
— it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house —

00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:26.693
and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.366
but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.591
"No, I'm leaving today."

00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:35.047
Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,

00:05:35.047 --> 00:05:37.351
some attacking me badly,

00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:41.076
and others supportive and even collecting signatures

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:45.319
in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.103
I was released after nine days.

00:05:47.103 --> 00:05:49.789
June 17 comes.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.479
The streets were packed with police cars

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.640
and religious police cars,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.943
but some hundred brave Saudi women

00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:58.975
broke the ban and drove that day.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.063
None were arrested. We broke the taboo.

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:07.406
(Applause)

00:06:12.407 --> 00:06:15.799
So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.984
or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,

00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:20.282
but maybe few know why.

00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:22.866
Allow me to help you answer this question.

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:26.002
There was this official study

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.046
that was presented to the Shura Council --

00:06:28.046 --> 00:06:30.310
it's the consultative council appointed

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.293
by the king in Saudi Arabia —

00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:34.334
and it was done by a local professor,

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:35.652
a university professor.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:40.015
He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.

00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:43.007
And the study states,

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:46.799
the percentage of rape, adultery,

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.239
illegitimate children, even drug abuse,

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.327
prostitution in countries where women drive

00:06:53.327 --> 00:06:56.849
is higher than countries where women don't drive.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.186
(Laughter)

00:06:58.186 --> 00:06:59.689
I know, I was like this, I was shocked.

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.809
I was like, "We are the last country in the world

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:04.762
where women don't drive."

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.928
So if you look at the map of the world,

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.621
that only leaves two countries:

00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:13.007
Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:16.095
We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:18.563
and it made headlines around the world.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.327
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]

00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:21.592
(Laughter)

00:07:21.592 --> 00:07:24.263
And only then we realized it's so empowering

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:25.727
to mock your oppressor.

00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:30.226
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:33.830
This system is based on ultra-conservative

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.737
traditions and customs

00:07:35.737 --> 00:07:38.984
that deal with women as if they are inferior

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.481
and they need a guardian to protect them,

00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:43.685
so they need to take permission from this guardian,

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:45.851
whether verbal or written, all their lives.

00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:48.307
We are minors until the day we die.

00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:52.213
And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:54.915
based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,

00:07:54.915 --> 00:07:57.105
or the religious laws.

00:07:57.105 --> 00:07:59.230
What's worst, when they become codified

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.681
as laws in the system,

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:05.077
and when women themselves believe in their inferiority,

00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:07.567
and they even fight those who try

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:11.137
to question these rules.

00:08:11.137 --> 00:08:15.403
So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.

00:08:15.403 --> 00:08:18.217
It was about living two totally different

00:08:18.217 --> 00:08:21.177
perceptions of my personality, of my person --

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:23.889
the villain back in my home country,

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.912
and the hero outside.

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:29.987
Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:32.365
One of them is when I was in jail.

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.023
I'm pretty sure when I was in jail,

00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:38.474
everyone saw titles in the international media

00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:42.519
something like this during these nine days I was in jail.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.996
But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:47.665
It was more like this:

00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:50.697
"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.439
and inciting women to drive."

00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:57.473
I know.

00:08:57.473 --> 00:08:59.522
"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:02.089
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.

00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:04.486
"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:

00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:06.298
'Foreign forces incited me.'"

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:08.657
(Laughter)

00:09:08.657 --> 00:09:13.854
And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:17.282
So it's a totally different picture.

00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:19.054
I was asked last year to give a speech

00:09:19.054 --> 00:09:21.666
at the Oslo Freedom Forum.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:24.251
I was surrounded by this love

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:26.386
and the support of people around me,

00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:28.571
and they looked at me as an inspiration.

00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:31.433
At the same time, I flew back to my home country,

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:33.358
they hated that speech so much.

00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:35.897
The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country

00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:37.489
and the Saudi people,

00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:40.850
and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.119
Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:46.937
while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,

00:09:46.937 --> 00:09:48.721
there was like a handful of tweets written.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.661
They even started a poll.

00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:53.944
More than 13,000 voters answered this poll:

00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:56.970
whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.996
Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.886
So it's these two totally different perceptions

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:05.493
of my personality.

00:10:05.493 --> 00:10:07.517
For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,

00:10:07.517 --> 00:10:09.116
and I do love my country,

00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:12.045
and because I love my country, I'm doing this.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:14.910
Because I believe a society will not be free

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.453
if the women of that society are not free.

00:10:17.453 --> 00:10:27.382
(Applause)

00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:29.734
Thank you.

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:32.550
(Applause)

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.174
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:47.938
(Applause)

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:51.615
Thank you.

00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:55.836
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.

00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:58.054
I learned to be always there.

00:10:58.054 --> 00:11:00.292
The first thing, I got out of jail,

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:03.612
of course after I took a shower, I went online,

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:06.831
I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.119
and I've been always very respectful

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:10.626
to those people who are opining to me.

00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.226
I would listen to what they say,

00:11:12.226 --> 00:11:15.159
and I would never defend myself with words only.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.567
I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:20.725
I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate

00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:24.967
of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:26.942
There are a lot of people also --

00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:29.247
very big support, like those 3,000 people

00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:31.611
who signed the petition to release me.

00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:34.815
We sent a petition to the Shura Council

00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:38.047
in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,

00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:41.256
and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:42.889
and they signed that petition.

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.760
There were people like that, I just showed some examples,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.872
who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:51.600
and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.408
because of speaking up and voicing their views.

00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:57.785
Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps

00:11:57.785 --> 00:11:59.994
toward enhancing women's rights.

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:02.192
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king,

00:12:02.192 --> 00:12:04.546
by royal decree of King Abdullah,

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:08.154
last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,

00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:10.682
like 20 percent.

00:12:10.682 --> 00:12:13.410
20 percent of the Council. (Applause)

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.570
The same time, finally, that Council,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.562
after rejecting our petition four times for women driving,

00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:21.137
they finally accepted it last February.

00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:26.127
(Applause)

00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:27.964
After being sent to jail

00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:30.817
or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:32.906
the spokesperson of the traffic police said,

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:37.217
we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.

00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:38.655
The Grand Mufti, who is the head

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:41.431
of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,

00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:45.543
he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.

00:12:45.543 --> 00:12:50.073
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:55.622
So for me, it's not about only these small steps.

00:12:55.622 --> 00:12:57.187
It's about women themselves.

00:12:57.187 --> 00:12:58.839
A friend once asked me, she said,

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:01.590
"So when do you think this women driving will happen?"

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.339
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.113
and take action to make it now."

00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:08.767
So it's not only about the system,

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:15.210
it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:21.362
So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.

00:13:21.362 --> 00:13:25.329
And I don't know how I became one now.

00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:28.977
But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future

00:13:28.977 --> 00:13:31.745
when someone asks me my story,

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:33.977
I will say, "I'm proud

00:13:33.977 --> 00:13:36.833
to be amongst those women who lifted the ban,

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:40.608
fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."

00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:43.905
So the question I started my talk with,

00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:47.105
who do you think is more difficult to face,

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:50.062
oppressive governments or oppressive societies?

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.961
I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.

00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:54.417
Thank you, everyone.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:59.185
(Applause)

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:02.309
Thank you.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:07.993
(Applause)

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:11.517
Thank you. (Applause)
