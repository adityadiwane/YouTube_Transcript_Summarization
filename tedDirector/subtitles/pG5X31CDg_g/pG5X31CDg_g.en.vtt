00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio --

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
it might have given it away --

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
I was amputated at age one,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Why don't we start there?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.160
AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
They pick three students out of the nation every year

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
to get involved in international affairs,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
and so I won a full ride to Georgetown

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
and I've been there for four years. Love it.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
SS: When Aimee got there,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
So, why don't you tell that story?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
I played softball for five years growing up.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
I skied competitively throughout high school,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and I got a little restless in college

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know --

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
That's all I'd ever known.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.160
and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
to see how far I could run, 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
And I had these legs that were made of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps --

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
big, thick, five-ply wool socks on --

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And I'm up there in Boston against people

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160
and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things --

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
and they're all looking at me like,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
OK, we know who's not going to win this race.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
And, I mean, I went up there expecting --

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
I don't know what I was expecting --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and clear it at six feet, two inches ...

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of --

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
these are truly accomplished athletes,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
without qualifying that word "athlete."

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.160
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
by three hundredths of a second,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And, you know, people said,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
"Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed --

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
You were all over the place.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
We all saw how hard you were working."

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.160
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
He's coached five Olympians, and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
with All America certificates

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
of all these athletes he's coached.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
He's just a rather intimidating figure.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.160
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
(Laughter)

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
"I want to see if I can, you know --

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
see what drills you do and whatever."

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
That's all I wanted -- just two practices.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
So, I met the man, walked in his office,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.160
and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
And we got to talking,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
and it turned out to be a great partnership

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
because he'd never coached a disabled athlete,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
so therefore he had no preconceived notions

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
of what I was or wasn't capable of,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and I'd never been coached before.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip."

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
So that's how I met Frank.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
he said, "You know, you're good enough.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
You can run on our women's track team here."

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
And I said, "No, come on."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
And he said, "No, no, really. You can.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
You can run with our women's track team."

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.160
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160
that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.160
SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Why don't you just tell them?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets --

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
and knowing that I was going to have to get used to 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
seeing the backs of all these women's shirts --

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo --

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
and they're all looking at me like,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And putting on my Georgetown uniform

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and going out there and knowing that, you know,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country --

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And I went out there and made it to the Big East,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
It was really, really hot.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And it's the first --

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
and I didn't realize at that time that

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock --

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
it actually acted like a lubricant

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
I came out of my leg.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And I, I mean, was just mortified --

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.160
because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
(Laughter)

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
I went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And he just sat there like this.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.160
My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn;

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.160
he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160
and finish the goddamn race!"

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.160
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.160
And I did. So, he kept me in line.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
He kept me on the right track.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.160
SS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
It's now two years that you've been running?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160
AM: No, a year.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
SS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
right before you go run your race?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities --

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes --

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
as opposed to the Special Olympics,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
which deals with people with mental disabilities.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:36.160
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
and I'm just blown away by the fact that

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
And so, here I am -- never lost.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.160
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.160
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
I had just done the long jump,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
so we can't get off on the springboard."

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record --

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
and kept on from that point, you know,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
And I'm sure of it, you know?

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
I made the front page of my hometown paper

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
that I delivered for six years, you know?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
It was, like, this is my time for shine. 

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And we're at the trainee warm-up track,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now --

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
I was the first person in the world on these legs.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
Everyone was taking pictures -- "What is this girl running on?"

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
It's my first international meet.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
I tried to get it out of anybody I could,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
you know, "Who am I running against here?"

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
I wanted to find out times.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
"Don't worry, you're doing great."

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.160
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and all the women there are missing a hand.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:44.160
(Laughter)

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
So, I'm just, like --

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
You know, I'd never lost anything,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.160
I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
And Georgetown -- that was great.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.160
I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
Here we are, like, crème de la crème,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
And, you know, I'm just thinking,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
and drove down here from Pennsylvania."

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
So they call us out and, you know --

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
"Ladies, you have one minute."

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.160
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
if I'm not going to beat these girls,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
(Laughter)

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.160
and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
And the gun went off, and all I remember was

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160
finishing last and

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160
fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible --

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
this feeling of just being overwhelmed.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
All this training -- I had transformed my life.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160
And it made me really think about how

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
the achievement was getting there.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160
on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
"Here's my life going in this direction --

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and I want to take it here for a while,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and just seeing how far I could push it."

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.160
How many people gave of their time and their expertise,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
and their patience, to deal with me?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
And that was this collective glory --

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
that there was, you know, 50 people behind me

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.160
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
to everything I do:

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
sitting back and realizing the progression,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.160
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
also recognize the progression on the way there

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and how you've grown as a person.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
SS: Why don't you show them your legs?

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
AM: Oh, sure.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160
(Laughter)

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:09.160
No, these are my cosmetic legs, actually, 

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
and they're absolutely beautiful.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160
You've got to come up and see them.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.160
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
SS: You got to pick your height?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
(Laughter)

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
comes back every summer. 

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160
because he'd come in with foot injuries.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
(Laughter)

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.160
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:13.160
like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
No, I've got so many legs in here.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
These are -- do you want to hold that actually?

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.160
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
when you jump around on it. All right.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.160
to keep it on. Which, when I sweat,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
you know, I'm pistoning out of it.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
SS: Are you a different height?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160
AM: In these?

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
SS: In these.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
AM: I don't know. I don't think so.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.160
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.160
SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
and balance is a little bit of an art in them.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:19.160
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:29.160
(Applause)

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:36.160
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
If you ever watch a sprinter,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160
So when I stand in these legs,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
my hamstring and my glutes are contracted,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160
as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
(Audience: Who made them?)

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160
But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
it's like a big -- it's come full circle.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
Moderator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
and we'll talk about the design of them.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160
AM: Yes, we'll do that.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160
SS: Yes, there you go.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
AM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160
about two hours south of London,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.160
and I'm the only person in the United States with these,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
which is a crime because they are so beautiful.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
not to be limited in any capacity,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.160
whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.160
and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want --

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.160
and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
and make them accessible to a lot of people.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
They're also silicon.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.160
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
It's like a Barbie foot under this.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160
(Laughter)

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
It is. It's just stuck in this position,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
so I have to wear a two-inch heel.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.160
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160
I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.160
There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.160
and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.160
And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.160
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
I mean, what happened was, two years ago

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
this man in Belgium was saying, "God,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160
if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.160
and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160
looking so real as if she breathed,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
why can't they build a limb for someone

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.160
that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?"

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
I mean, they make ears for burn victims.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160
They do amazing stuff with silicon.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
And she came into town and she rushed around

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160
We're an hour before the ESPYs,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.160
AM: And this poses a problem for me,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
because it means I'm walking like that all night long.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160
SS: For 45 minutes. Luckily, the hotel was terrific.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.160
(Laughter)

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.160
AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side --

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
Because I have this problem ... "

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.160
You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
"If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late."

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
"No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.160
that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.160
I need a little bit off."

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160
They didn't even want to go there.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.160
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.160
No, these legs are great.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.160
I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
to get some improvements.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.160
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
So... Moderator: That's it.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
SS: That's Aimee Mullins.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
