00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.396
The best Christmas my children ever had

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.740
was also the worst Christmas
my husband and I ever had.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.436
Elizabeth, age seven,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.316
and her brother, Ian, age five,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.059
couldn't imagine why they were getting
everything they wanted for Christmas.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.780
The reason Santa was so generous

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.836
was because of something
my husband Pat and I knew

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.700
and the kids couldn't comprehend.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.420
Something that we had just learned,
and it terrified us.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.636
This was 1994

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.020
and the story actually starts
a few years earlier.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.420
For a couple of years I had noticed
a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.700
that looked like prickly heat.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.660
For those same years,
my father and brother both died of cancer,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.100
and I was probably
overanxious about illness.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.716
The doctors assured us
there was nothing wrong

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.476
and I shouldn't worry,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.900
but I wasn't so sure.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.116
And so without a referral,
and paying out-of-pocket,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.339
I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.716
She was probably
just allergic to something,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.140
but why did it appear
just on the sides of her neck, this rash?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.596
So it's two days before Christmas,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.820
1994,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.396
and the dermatologist
takes a quick look at her neck and says,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.460
"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.060
And then he shuts off the lights
and looks in her eyes.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.796
It turns out, by chance,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.940
this dermatologist
also trained in ophthalmology.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.100
Our lucky day.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.980
I am sick to my stomach.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.716
"Oma?"

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.636
Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma --

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.860
cancer.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.396
"Why are you looking
in her eyes for a skin rash?"

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.500
I scream and make no sound.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.740
So there it is.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.180
Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.820
PXE for short.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.996
Questions mix with fear

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.220
and erupt like bile in my throat.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.460
Why are you looking in her eyes?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.636
What do you know about this?
How do you know for sure?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.140
What is the prognosis?

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.740
My training in pastoral counseling
did not prepare me for this.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.380
Dr. Bercovitch tells us
everything he knows about PXE.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.420
It's a rare genetic disorder,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.820
it's systemic,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.780
it's a slowly progressing,
premature aging disease.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.220
It causes loose wrinkly skin
in the flexor areas.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.356
It causes legal blindness,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.100
like macular degeneration,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500
and a host of cardiovascular problems.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.580
Little is known about this disease,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.236
and some people die in their 30s,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.740
say some of the reports at the time.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.060
He then just glances at our son and says,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.140
"He has it, too."

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.060
We want to flee
back to the land of normal.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.156
Two days after Christmas,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.196
researchers come
from a university in Boston,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.716
and they take blood
from us and our children

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.380
for a research project
focused on finding the gene.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.556
A few days later,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.996
researchers come
from a medical center in New York

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.540
and say they want blood, too.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.740
"These are children.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.476
They're five and seven years old.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500
Don't make them face the needle twice.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.220
Go and get your share
from the other researchers."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.476
They laugh, incredulous.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.700
"Share?"

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.420
It is then that we learn that there
is little sharing in biomedical research.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.036
This moment, more than any other,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.700
lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.636
Pat and I went to a medical school library

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.620
and we copied every article
we could find on PXE.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.500
We didn't understand a thing.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.396
We bought medical dictionaries
and scientific textbooks

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.563
and read everything
we could get our hands on.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.236
And though we still didn't understand,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.116
we could see patterns,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.516
and it became quickly
apparent within a month

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.500
that there was no systematic effort
to understand PXE.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.036
In addition,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.300
the lack of sharing
that we experienced was pervasive.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.580
Researchers competed with each other

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.500
because the ecosystem
was designed to reward competition

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.340
rather than to alleviate suffering.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.676
We realized that we would have to do
work on this condition ourselves

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.220
to find solutions
for ourselves and others like us.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.716
But we faced two major barriers.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.236
The first one:

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.620
Pat and I have no science background.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.156
At the time, he's the manager
of a construction company,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.036
and I'm a former college chaplain
stay-at-home mom --

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.700
hardly the backgrounds
to take the research world by storm.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.980
The second barrier:

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.660
researchers don't share.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.340
People told us you can't herd cats.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.996
Well, yes you can if you move their food.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.060
(Laughter)

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.780
(Applause)

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.220
DNA and clinical data is the food.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.916
So we would collect blood
and medical histories,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.516
and require that all scientists
using these resources

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.220
would share results with each other
and with the people who donated.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.116
Well before the internet
was in common use,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.996
Pat and I established PXE International,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.916
a nonprofit dedicated to initiating
research and conducting it on PXE

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.420
and also supporting
individuals with the disease.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.996
Using traditional media,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.436
we garnered around
100-150 people around the world

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.716
who we asked,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.996
would you give us your blood,
your tissue, your medical histories,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.220
your medical records?

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.860
And we brought all of that together.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.700
We quickly learned that this shared
resource was not going to be enough.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.076
And so we decided we had
to do hardcore bench science --

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.460
hardcore research.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.540
So we borrowed bench space
at a lab at Harvard.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.796
A wonderful neighbor
came a couple times a week

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.876
and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.236
while Pat and I extracted DNA,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.996
ran and scored gels

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.300
and searched for the gene.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.540
Generous postdocs
tutored us as we went along.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.660
Within a few years, we found the gene.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.196
We patented it so that
it would be freely available.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.276
We created a diagnostic test.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.460
We put together a research consortium.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.620
We held research meetings
and opened a center of excellence.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.556
We found more than 4,000 people
around the world who had PXE,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.516
and held patient meetings

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.100
and did clinical trials and studies.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.156
Through all this,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.460
we lived with fear.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.660
Fear of the disease
breathing down our neck

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.500
while the clock ticked.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.260
Fear of researchers,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.860
so well credentialed and positioned
in a world made for them.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.180
Fear that we were making
the wrong choices.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.596
Fear that the naysayers were right

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.740
and the cats would simply find a new food.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.796
But greater than all these fears
was our drive to make a difference

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.820
for our kids and for all those
we had met along the way.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.316
And very quickly,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.076
we also realized what we
were doing for one disease,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.220
we should do for all diseases.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.836
We joined with, and I eventually led,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.076
Genetic Alliance --

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.396
a network of health advocacy,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.636
patient advocacy,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.300
research and health organizations.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.436
We built scalable
and extensible resources,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.276
like biobanks and registries
and directories of support

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.620
for all diseases.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.676
And as I learned about all those diseases
and all those disease communities,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.556
I realized that there were
two secrets in health care

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.380
that were impacting me greatly.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.556
The first:

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.996
there are no ready answers
for people like my kids

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.955
or all the people I was working with,

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:51.020
whether common or rare conditions.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:52.979
And the second secret:

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.676
the answers lie in all of us together,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.180
donating our data,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.356
our biological samples

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.100
and ultimately ourselves.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.596
There is a small
groundswell of individuals

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.876
who are working to change this.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.956
Citizen scientists, activists, hacks

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.156
who are using crowdsourcing,
do-it-yourself science

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.380
are changing the game.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.340
Even President Obama
and Vice President Biden

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.196
are evangelists for the idea

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.700
that people should be
partners in research.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.100
This is a founding principle
of our organization.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.916
Sure, it's really hard

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.140
to discover and develop
interventions and therapies.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.636
The science is hard,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.940
the regulatory regime is difficult.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.796
There are a lot of stakeholders
with lots of interests

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.100
and misaligned incentives
like publishing, promotion and tenure.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.596
I don't fault scientists
for following this path,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.460
but I challenge them and us
to do this differently.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.380
To recognize that people
are at the center.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.996
Genetic Alliance has experimented

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.500
in what it will take
to transform these crusty systems.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.980
Our goal is to work without boundaries.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.820
That sounds abstract,
but for us it's quite practical.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.916
When we're frustrated
that entities won't share data --

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.036
data that comes from people who gave
their energy, their time, their blood

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.580
and even their tears --

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.956
we need to stop and ask,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.100
"How is it true that we
could share, but we aren't?"

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.180
We're part of this system, too.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.380
How do we make it
so that people can share ideas freely?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.700
So that people can take risks
and move closer to one another?

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.556
This leads to a dissolving
of us versus them,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.940
not only for organizations
but also for individuals.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.916
If I'm going to ask
organizations or individuals

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.156
to strive for these standards,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.060
then I too need to explore
my own being and my practices.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.196
If I'm going to ask clinicians
and researchers and administrators

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.796
to take risks,

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.820
then I, Sharon,
need to take risks as well.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.500
I need to face my personal fears.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.380
My fear of not having enough impact.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.700
My fear of not leading well.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.740
My fear of not being enough.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.476
Just before they entered their teens,
our kids stopped us in our tracks

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.196
and said, "You have to stop worrying
about making a difference,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.476
making an impact,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.476
and instead, like us,
learn to live with disease

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.380
rather than fight it."

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.716
I have to ask,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.980
where does all my fear come from?

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.900
The kids' declaration
shines a spotlight on that fear.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.660
It arises from a bedrock of love.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.300
I love Elizabeth and Ian.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.260
I love people with PXE.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.460
I love people with any disease.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.740
I love people.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.956
Some of my colleagues have discovered
that it is not death we fear,

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.180
it is the enormity of our loving.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.356
This expansive love opens me to great pain

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.100
as I face loss.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.220
As I discover my fear,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.756
I discover that I

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.396
and all those around me

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.140
have boundless capacity for love.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.860
And I also discover

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.660
as I move into this fear,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.676
that I can learn many new things

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.060
and find paths

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.996
to things like practical solutions

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.180
as well as the core of healing and health.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.380
I don't fear fear the way I used to.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.516
In fact lately, with enormous support
from all my fellow journeyers,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.860
I notice that it's not a warning
the way it used to be.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.716
I notice that instead,

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.636
it's an invitation to go forward

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.900
because in it lies love
and the path to greater love.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.060
If I turn with gentle curiosity
toward that fear,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.676
I find enormous wealth
within myself and others

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.020
and the ability to step into challenges
that I never thought I could.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.140
My kids are ahead of me
on that path still.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.076
At ages 29 and 27,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.556
they declare they are happy and healthy

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.700
despite having manifestations of PXE
in their skin and eyes and arteries.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.316
And so I invite you, us, we,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.916
to turn toward our fear;

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.876
to embrace the things that scare us

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.036
and find the love at the center.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.276
We'll not only find ourselves there

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.276
but we'll also be able
to step into the shoes of those we fear

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.660
and those who fear us.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.340
If we breathe into that fear

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.036
and are vulnerable with the systems
and people who challenge us,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.140
our power as changemakers
grows exponentially.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.476
And when we realize

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.156
that working on our inner life
is working on our outer life

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.916
and outer work is inner work,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.076
we get down to what is real

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.516
and shit gets done.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.996
(Laughter)

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.836
There is no limit
to what we can accomplish together.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.076
Thank you.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.660
(Applause)
