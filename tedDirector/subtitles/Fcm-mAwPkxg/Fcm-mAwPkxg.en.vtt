00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:14.794
Like many of us,

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:17.190
I've had several careers in my life,

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.365
and although they've been varied,

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:23.276
my first job set the foundation
for all of them.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.313
I was a home-birth midwife
throughout my 20s.

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:32.747
Delivering babies taught me
valuable and sometimes surprising things,

00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.541
like how to start a car at 2am.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:37.363
when it's 10 degrees below zero.

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:38.388
(Laughter)

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:42.747
Or how to revive a father
who's fainted at the sight of blood.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:43.822
(Laughter)

00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:46.292
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:48.537
to make a beautiful belly button.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.346
But those aren't the things
that stuck with me or guided me

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.354
when I stopped being a midwife
and started other jobs.

00:00:56.378 --> 00:01:00.471
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:05.507
that each one of us comes into this world
with a unique worth.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:09.653
When I looked into the face of a newborn,

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:13.885
I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.751
that sense of unapologetic selfhood,

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.951
that unique spark.

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:24.343
I use the word "soul"
to describe that spark,

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:29.006
because it's the only word in English
that comes close to naming

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.742
what each baby brought into the room.

00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:37.291
Every newborn was as singular
as a snowflake,

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.686
a matchless mash-up of biology

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.374
and ancestry and mystery.

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:46.031
And then that baby grows up,

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.170
and in order to fit into the family,

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.235
to conform to the culture,

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.529
to the community, to the gender,

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:56.116
that little one begins to cover its soul,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.654
layer by layer.

00:01:58.197 --> 00:01:59.911
We're born this way,

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:01.563
but --

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:03.179
(Laughter)

00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:06.192
But as we grow, a lot
of things happen to us

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.050
that make us ...

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:14.959
want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity.

00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:16.350
We've all done this.

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:19.213
Everyone in this room is a former baby --

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:20.259
(Laughter)

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:22.768
with a distinctive birthright.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.776
But as adults, we spend so much
of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.778
like we have ADD:
authenticity deficit disorder.

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.057
But not those babies --

00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:36.323
not yet.

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.125
Their message to me was:

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.704
uncover your soul

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.921
and look for that soul-spark

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.155
in everyone else.

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.402
It's still there.

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:49.934
And here's what I learned
from laboring women.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:53.414
Their message was about staying open,

00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:55.665
even when things are painful.

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:59.012
A woman's cervix normally looks like this.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:01.186
It's a tight little muscle

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.837
at the base of the uterus.

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:06.628
And during labor,
it has to stretch from this

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:08.958
to this.

00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:10.245
Ouch!

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.875
If you fight against that pain,

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.027
you just create more pain,

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:17.807
and you block what wants to be born.

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:22.320
I'll never forget the magic
that would happen

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:24.987
when a woman stopped resisting the pain

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:27.472
and opened.

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:30.663
It was as if the forces
of the universe took notice

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.306
and sent in a wave of help.

00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:35.895
I never forgot that message,

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.939
and now, when difficult
or painful things happen to me

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:41.502
in my life or my work,

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.537
of course at first I resist them,

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.785
but then I remember
what I learned from the mothers:

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.142
stay open.

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:50.937
Stay curious.

00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:53.666
Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.

00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:56.475
Something new wants to be born.

00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.609
And there was one more big soulful lesson,

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.427
and that one I learned
from Albert Einstein.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.725
He wasn't at any of the births, but --

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:05.781
(Laughter)

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:08.447
It was a lesson about time.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:13.885
At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.059
that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.430
is an illusion.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.236
We run round and round, faster and faster,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.883
trying to get somewhere.

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:26.439
And all the while,

00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:30.647
underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension

00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:35.987
where the past and the present
and the future merge

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.940
and become deep time.

00:04:39.414 --> 00:04:42.109
And there's nowhere to get to.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:47.065
Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension,

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:48.750
"only being."

00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:50.730
And he said when he experienced it,

00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:53.061
he knew sacred awe.

00:04:53.818 --> 00:04:55.467
When I was delivering babies,

00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:57.386
I was forced off the hamster wheel.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.189
Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours,

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.799
just breathing with the parents;

00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:05.159
just being.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.615
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:13.810
So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery.

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.698
One: uncover your soul.

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:23.544
Two: when things get difficult
or painful, try to stay open.

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:27.501
And three: every now and then,
step off your hamster wheel

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:29.550
into deep time.

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:34.133
Those lessons have served me
throughout my life,

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:37.314
but they really served me recently,

00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:41.926
when I took on the most
important job of my life thus far.

00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:46.938
Two years ago, my younger sister
came out of remission

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:49.321
from a rare blood cancer,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.042
and the only treatment left for her
was a bone marrow transplant.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.797
And against the odds,
we found a match for her,

00:05:57.821 --> 00:05:59.731
who turned out to be me.

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:03.573
I come from a family of four girls,

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:10.488
and when my sisters found out that
I was my sister's perfect genetic match,

00:06:10.512 --> 00:06:12.842
their reaction was, "Really? You?"

00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:14.249
(Laughter)

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.429
"A perfect match for her?"

00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:18.983
Which is pretty typical for siblings.

00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:22.197
In a sibling society,
there's lots of things.

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:26.418
There's love and there's friendship
and there's protection.

00:06:26.442 --> 00:06:28.098
But there's also jealousy

00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:29.887
and competition

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.033
and rejection and attack.

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:39.805
In siblinghood, that's where we start
assembling many of those first layers

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.316
that cover our soul.

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:45.109
When I discovered I was my sister's match,

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:46.850
I went into research mode.

00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:48.784
And I discovered that

00:06:50.028 --> 00:06:52.762
the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward.

00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:56.046
You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.806
with massive doses of chemotherapy,

00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:01.703
and then you replace that marrow

00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:05.567
with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor.

00:07:05.937 --> 00:07:07.743
And then you do everything you can

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:12.052
to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient.

00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:16.974
I also learned that bone marrow
transplants are fraught with danger.

00:07:17.468 --> 00:07:22.308
If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.918
she still would face other challenges.

00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:28.252
My cells

00:07:28.863 --> 00:07:31.370
might attack her body.

00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:34.822
And her body might reject my cells.

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:37.291
They call this rejection or attack,

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:38.941
and both could kill her.

00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:41.575
Rejection. Attack.

00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:44.282
Those words had a familiar ring

00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:46.779
in the context of being siblings.

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.652
My sister and I had
a long history of love,

00:07:50.676 --> 00:07:53.968
but we also had a long history
of rejection and attack,

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:58.484
from minor misunderstandings
to bigger betrayals.

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:01.306
We didn't have
the kind of the relationship

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.455
where we talked about the deeper stuff;

00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:08.567
but, like many siblings and like people
in all kinds of relationships,

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:11.941
we were hesitant to tell our truths,

00:08:11.965 --> 00:08:14.843
to reveal our wounds,

00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:16.718
to admit our wrongdoings.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.071
But when I learned about
the dangers of rejection or attack,

00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:24.399
I thought, it's time to change this.

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:29.889
What if we left the bone marrow
transplant up to the doctors,

00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:35.722
but did something that we later came
to call our "soul marrow transplant?"

00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:40.191
What if we faced any pain
we had caused each other,

00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:42.922
and instead of rejection or attack,

00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:44.770
could we listen?

00:08:45.272 --> 00:08:46.698
Could we forgive?

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:48.556
Could we merge?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.051
Would that teach our cells to do the same?

00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:58.244
To woo my skeptical sister,
I turned to my parents' holy text:

00:08:58.268 --> 00:08:59.869
the New Yorker Magazine.

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:01.809
(Laughter)

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:05.404
I sent her a cartoon from its pages

00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:09.053
as a way of explaining
why we should visit a therapist

00:09:09.077 --> 00:09:14.443
before having my bone marrow harvested
and transplanted into her body.

00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:15.712
Here it is.

00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:19.850
"I have never forgiven him for that thing
I made up in my head."

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:22.281
(Laughter)

00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:24.251
I told my sister

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.787
we had probably been doing the same thing,

00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:33.531
carting around made-up stories
in our heads that kept us separate.

00:09:34.184 --> 00:09:37.076
And I told her that after the transplant,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.694
all of the blood flowing in her veins

00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:41.199
would be my blood,

00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:43.643
made from my marrow cells,

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:48.530
and that inside the nucleus
of each of those cells

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.820
is a complete set of my DNA.

00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:54.731
"I will be swimming around in you
for the rest of your life,"

00:09:54.755 --> 00:09:57.514
I told my slightly horrified sister.

00:09:57.538 --> 00:09:59.718
(Laughter)

00:09:59.742 --> 00:10:02.830
"I think we better clean up
our relationship."

00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:07.488
A health crisis makes people
do all sorts of risky things,

00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:11.053
like quitting a job
or jumping out of an airplane

00:10:11.603 --> 00:10:13.594
and, in the case of my sister,

00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:17.352
saying "yes" to several therapy sessions,

00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:21.414
during which we got down to the marrow.

00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:27.981
We looked at and released years of stories

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:30.086
and assumptions about each other

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.188
and blame and shame

00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:35.750
until all that was left was love.

00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:42.363
People have said I was brave
to undergo the bone marrow harvest,

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:43.657
but I don't think so.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.190
What felt brave to me

00:10:46.214 --> 00:10:49.399
was that other kind
of harvest and transplant,

00:10:49.423 --> 00:10:51.319
the soul marrow transplant,

00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:55.750
getting emotionally naked
with another human being,

00:10:55.774 --> 00:10:59.243
putting aside pride and defensiveness,

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:00.903
lifting the layers

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:05.650
and sharing with each other
our vulnerable souls.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.215
I called on those midwife lessons:

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:10.865
uncover your soul.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.604
Open to what's scary and painful.

00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:16.484
Look for the sacred awe.

00:11:17.872 --> 00:11:21.137
Here I am with my marrow cells
after the harvest.

00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:23.061
That's they call it -- "harvest,"

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:26.285
like it's some kind of bucolic
farm-to-table event --

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:27.467
(Laughter)

00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.983
Which I can assure you it is not.

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:34.857
And here is my brave, brave sister

00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:36.577
receiving my cells.

00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:41.706
After the transplant, we began to spend
more and more time together.

00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:44.568
It was as if we were little girls again.

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:48.505
The past and the present merged.

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.735
We entered deep time.

00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:55.607
I left the hamster wheel of work and life

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.293
to join my sister

00:11:57.992 --> 00:11:59.989
on that lonely island

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:02.220
of illness and healing.

00:12:02.948 --> 00:12:04.791
We spent months together --

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:06.577
in the isolation unit,

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.959
in the hospital and in her home.

00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.100
Our fast-paced society

00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:17.284
does not support or even value
this kind of work.

00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:20.941
We see it as a disruption
of real life and important work.

00:12:21.426 --> 00:12:25.654
We worry about the emotional drain
and the financial cost --

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.253
and, yes, there is a financial cost.

00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:30.951
But I was paid

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.457
in the kind of currency our culture
seems to have forgotten all about.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.271
I was paid in love.

00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:41.374
I was paid in soul.

00:12:41.398 --> 00:12:43.568
I was paid in my sister.

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:49.984
My sister said the year after transplant
was the best year of her life,

00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:51.257
which was surprising.

00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.729
She suffered so much.

00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:57.596
But she said life never tasted as sweet,

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:00.748
and that because of the soul-baring

00:13:00.772 --> 00:13:03.318
and the truth-telling
we had done with each other,

00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:07.537
she became more unapologetically herself

00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:08.952
with everyone.

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:11.944
She said things
she'd always needed to say.

00:13:11.968 --> 00:13:14.756
She did things she always wanted to do.

00:13:15.263 --> 00:13:17.222
The same happened for me.

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:22.595
I became braver about being authentic
with the people in my life.

00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:25.610
I said my truths,

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:30.229
but more important than that,
I sought the truth of others.

00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:35.097
It wasn't until
the final chapter of this story

00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:38.570
that I realized just how well
midwifery had trained me.

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:42.129
After that best year of my sister's life,

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:44.154
the cancer came roaring back,

00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:47.974
and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do.

00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:50.664
They gave her just
a couple of months to live.

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:54.573
The night before my sister died,

00:13:55.163 --> 00:13:57.871
I sat by her bedside.

00:13:57.895 --> 00:14:00.178
She was so small and thin.

00:14:00.766 --> 00:14:03.289
I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.

00:14:03.869 --> 00:14:07.414
It was my blood, her blood, our blood.

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:11.314
When she died, part of me would die, too.

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:17.359
I tried to make sense of it all,

00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:19.513
how becoming one with each other

00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:22.017
had made us more ourselves,

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:23.548
our soul selves,

00:14:24.249 --> 00:14:29.442
and how by facing and opening
to the pain of our past,

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:31.965
we'd finally been delivered to each other,

00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.901
and how by stepping out of time,

00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:37.333
we would now be connected forever.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.910
My sister left me with so many things,

00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:45.085
and I'm going to leave you now
with just one of them.

00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:49.795
You don't have to wait
for a life-or-death situation

00:14:50.497 --> 00:14:53.616
to clean up the relationships
that matter to you,

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.263
to offer the marrow of your soul

00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:59.345
and to seek it in another.

00:15:00.297 --> 00:15:02.215
We can all do this.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:07.082
We can be like a new kind
of first responder,

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:11.309
like the one to take
the first courageous step

00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:13.658
toward the other,

00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:16.927
and to do something or try to do something

00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:20.073
other than rejection or attack.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.711
We can do this with our siblings

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:24.137
and our mates

00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:26.417
and our friends and our colleagues.

00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:29.069
We can do this with the disconnection

00:15:29.093 --> 00:15:31.843
and the discord all around us.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.076
We can do this for the soul of the world.

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:37.820
Thank you.

00:15:37.844 --> 00:15:43.840
(Applause)
