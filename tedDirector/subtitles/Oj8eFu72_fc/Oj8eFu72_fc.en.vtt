00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:17.112
I live in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:24.479
but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,
in India.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.973
My father was a government worker.

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.859
My mother could not read or write, but she

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.303
would say to me, "A king is 
worshipped only in his

00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:44.441
own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.895
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:52.077
But I almost didn't go to college

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:56.609
until an aunt offered financial help.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.794
I went to study in Sambalpur,

00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:02.989
the largest town in the region,

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.988
where, already in college, I saw a
television for the first time.

00:01:09.988 --> 00:01:12.148
I had dreams of going to the United States

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:14.748
for higher studies.

00:01:14.748 --> 00:01:16.877
When the opportunity came,

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.212
I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:25.905
for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:30.512
In the U.S., I worked in a research center,

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:34.817
part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.

00:01:34.817 --> 00:01:40.151
And with the little I earned, I would

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.458
finance myself and then I would send

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:46.916
money home to my brother and my father.

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.285
My story is not unique.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:54.559
There are millions of people who migrate each year.

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:58.340
With the help of the family, they cross oceans,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.155
they cross deserts, they cross 
rivers, they cross mountains.

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:09.483
They risk their lives to realize a dream,

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:12.156
and that dream is as simple as having a

00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:15.467
decent job somewhere so they can send money home

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.297
and help the family,

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:21.954
which has helped them before.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:27.046
There are 232 million international 
migrants in the world.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.395
These are people who live in a country

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:31.051
other than their country of birth.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:32.760
If there was a country made up of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.369
only international migrants,

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.426
that would be larger, in population,

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:37.863
than Brazil.

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:39.868
That would be larger, in its size

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.070
of the economy, than France.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.567
Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.718
send money home regularly.

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:55.743
Those sums of money are called remittances.

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:59.730
Here is a fact that might surprise you:

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.453
413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:07.486
was the amount of remittances sent last year

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:10.522
by migrants to developing countries.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:11.806
Migrants from developing countries,

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:13.950
money sent to developing countries â€”

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.400
413 billion dollars.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.120
That's a remarkable number because

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.985
that is three times the size of

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:23.799
the total of development aid money.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.262
And yet, you and I,

00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:28.768
my colleagues in Washington,

00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:30.765
we endlessly debate and

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.193
discuss about development aid,

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:37.482
while we ignore remittances as small change.

00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:40.635
True, people send 200 dollars per month,

00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:44.706
on average. But, repeated month after month,

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.744
by millions of people,

00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:50.811
these sums of money add up to rivers 
of foreign currency.

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:55.905
So India, last year, received 72 
billion dollars, larger than

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:58.361
its IT exports.

00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.345
In Egypt remittances are three times

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:04.917
the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.729
In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.568
And in poorer countries, smaller 
countries, fragile countries,

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:16.637
conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,

00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:20.013
as in Somalia or in Haiti.

00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:22.016
No wonder these flows have huge

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:26.916
impacts on economies and on poor people.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:30.725
Remittances, unlike private investment money,

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.752
they don't flow back at the first

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.543
sign of trouble in the country.

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:38.428
They actually act like an insurance.

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:40.848
When the family is in trouble,

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:43.453
facing hardship, facing hard times,

00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:45.520
remittances increase, they act like an insurance.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.079
Migrants send more money then.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.674
Unlike development aid money,

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:52.251
that must go through official agencies,

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:55.368
through governments, remittances

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:56.993
directly reach the poor,

00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.311
reach the family,

00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.865
and often with business advice.

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:04.045
So in Nepal, the share of poor

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:06.873
people was 42 percent in 1995,

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.060
the share of poor people in the population.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.662
By 2005, a decade later, at a

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:15.470
time of political crisis, economic crisis,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.839
the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.115
That decline in poverty, most of it,

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.014
about half of it, is believed to be

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:27.741
because of remittances from India,

00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:29.880
another poor country.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.043
In El Salvador, the school dropout

00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:37.281
rate among children is lower

00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:39.087
in families that receive remittances.

00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:41.056
In Mexico and Sri Lanka,

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:45.455
the birth weight of children is higher

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:50.869
among families that receive remittances.

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.568
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:57.289
Migrants send money home for food,

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.541
for buying necessities, for building houses,

00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.929
for funding education, for funding

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.658
healthcare for the elderly, for business

00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:06.916
investments for friends and family.

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:09.255
Migrants send even more money home

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:12.003
for special occasions like a surgery

00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:15.767
or a wedding. And migrants also send

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.707
money, perhaps far too many times,

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:21.103
for unexpected funerals that

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:25.001
they cannot attend.

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.679
Much as these flows do all that good,

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.077
there are barriers to these

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:30.987
flows of remittances, these

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:33.509
400 billion dollars of remittances.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.490
Foremost among them is

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.796
the exorbitant cost of sending money home.

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.793
Money transfer companies structure

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:45.567
their fees to milk the poor.

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:48.569
They will say, "Up to 500 dollars

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.244
if you want to send, we will charge you

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.538
30 dollars fixed."

00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:55.634
If you are poor and if you have 
only 200 dollars to send,

00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.876
you have to pay that $30 fee.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.911
The global average cost of sending

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:03.448
money is eight percent.

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:04.999
That means you send 100 dollars,

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.672
the family on the other side receives only

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.229
92 dollars.

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.013
To send money to Africa,

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.596
the cost is even higher:

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:12.942
12 percent.

00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:14.916
To send money within Africa,

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:16.400
the cost is even higher:

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.719
over 20 percent.

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.588
For example, sending money from Benin 
to Nigeria.

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:25.840
And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.321
because of exchange controls,

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.321
you send 100 dollars and you

00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:31.339
are lucky if the family on the other side

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.749
receives even 10 dollars.

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:37.693
Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela

00:07:37.693 --> 00:07:39.316
through the official channel.

00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:41.440
It all goes in suitcases.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.510
Whereever costs are high,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.893
money goes underground.

00:07:45.893 --> 00:07:47.829
And what is worse,

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:50.160
many developing countries actually

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.407
have a blanket ban on sending money

00:07:52.407 --> 00:07:54.110
out of the country.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.247
Many rich nations also have a

00:07:56.247 --> 00:08:01.743
blanket ban on sending money 
to specific countries.

00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:03.854
So, is it that there are no options,

00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:06.487
no better options, cheaper options, to send money?

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:07.278
There are.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.998
M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.639
and receive money at a fixed cost of only

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:16.536
60 cents per transaction.

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:19.402
U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:21.041
to enable money service businesses

00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:22.619
to send money to Mexico

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:27.852
for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.

00:08:27.852 --> 00:08:30.807
And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options

00:08:30.807 --> 00:08:33.794
can't be applied internationally

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:36.635
because of the fear of money laundering,

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:39.486
even though there is little data

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:42.211
to support any connection, any significant

00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:43.883
connection between money laundering

00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:49.273
and these small remittance transactions.

00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:50.700
Many international banks now

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.589
are wary of hosting bank accounts

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:56.990
of money service businesses, especially

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.650
those serving Somalia.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.347
Somalia, a country where the

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:09.491
per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:11.907
Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia

00:09:11.907 --> 00:09:14.219
is larger than that amount.

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:16.853
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.

00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:20.574
And yet, this is an example of

00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:22.445
the right hand giving a lot of aid,

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:26.463
while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood

00:09:26.463 --> 00:09:32.064
to that economy, through regulations.

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:36.972
Then there is the case of poor people
from villages, like me.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:38.988
In the villages, the only place where you can

00:09:38.988 --> 00:09:41.720
get money is through the post office.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.713
Most of the governments in the world

00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:46.729
have allowed their post offices to have

00:09:46.729 --> 00:09:49.965
exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:52.787
So, if I have to send money to my

00:09:52.787 --> 00:09:55.470
father in the village, I must send money

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.773
through that particular money transfer company,

00:09:57.773 --> 00:09:59.013
even if the cost is high.

00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:03.325
I cannot go to a cheaper option.

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:05.334
This has to go.

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:07.585
So, what can international organizations and

00:10:07.585 --> 00:10:09.602
social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost

00:10:09.602 --> 00:10:11.231
of sending money home?

00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:17.539
First, relax regulations on small remittances
under 1,000 dollars.

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:19.961
Governments should recognize that

00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:24.208
small remittances are not money laundering.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:28.647
Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships

00:10:28.647 --> 00:10:31.641
between their post office and the money 
transfer company.

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:33.230
For that matter, between the post office

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.257
and any national banking system that

00:10:35.257 --> 00:10:38.337
has a large network that serves the poor.

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:41.621
In fact, they should promote competition,

00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:44.650
open up the partnership so that

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.799
we will bring down costs like we did,

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:51.275
like they did, in the telecommunications industry.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.272
You have seen what has happened there.

00:10:54.272 --> 00:10:59.075
Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.285
should create a remittance platform

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.868
on a nonprofit basis.

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:03.940
They should create a nonprofit

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.140
remittance platform to serve the money transfer

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.869
companies so that they can send money at a low cost,

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.020
while complying with all the complex

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.732
regulations all over the world.

00:11:16.732 --> 00:11:18.134
The development community should

00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:20.411
set a goal of reducing remittance costs

00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:23.664
to one percent from the current eight percent.

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:25.924
If we reduce costs to one percent,

00:11:25.924 --> 00:11:30.193
that would release a saving of 
30 billion dollars per year.

00:11:30.193 --> 00:11:34.594
Thirty billion dollars, that's 
larger than the entire

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:37.743
bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.

00:11:37.743 --> 00:11:40.759
That is larger than, or almost similar to,

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:43.928
the total aid budget of the United States government,

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:46.784
the largest donor on the planet.

00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:48.409
Actually, the savings would be larger

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.532
than that 30 billion because remittance channels

00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:55.939
are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.

00:11:55.939 --> 00:11:58.410
Another major impediment to the

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.664
flow of remittances reaching the family

00:12:00.664 --> 00:12:03.229
is the large and exorbitant

00:12:03.229 --> 00:12:06.207
and illegal cost of recruitment,

00:12:06.207 --> 00:12:09.145
fees that migrants pay, migrant workers

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.409
pay to laborers who found them the job.

00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:16.015
I was in Dubai a few years ago.

00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:18.290
I visited a camp for workers.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:23.603
It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.

00:12:23.603 --> 00:12:25.415
Workers were coming back from

00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:27.886
their grueling day of work,

00:12:27.886 --> 00:12:29.670
and I struck a conversation

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.530
with a Bangladeshi construction worker.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.439
He was preoccupied that he is sending

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:36.956
money home, he has been

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.866
sending money home for a few months now,

00:12:39.866 --> 00:12:41.369
and the money is mostly going

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:44.021
to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:45.664
who found him that job.

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:49.408
And in my mind, I could picture

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:50.589
the wife waiting for

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:52.315
the monthly remittance.

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:54.080
The remittance arrives.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.809
She takes the money and hands

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:59.379
it over to the recruitment agent,

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.375
while the children are looking on.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.705
This has to stop.

00:13:05.705 --> 00:13:10.521
It is not only construction 
workers from Bangladesh,

00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:12.227
it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant

00:13:12.227 --> 00:13:15.178
workers who suffer from this problem.

00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:16.855
A construction worker from Bangladesh,

00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:20.650
on an average, pays about 4,000 
dollars in recruitment fees

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:26.029
for a job that gives him only 2,000 
dollars per year in income.

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:28.759
That means that for the two years or three years

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:32.252
of his life, he is basically sending money

00:13:32.252 --> 00:13:33.536
to pay for the recruitment fees.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:37.049
The family doesn't get to see any of it.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:40.820
It is not only Dubai, it is the dark

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.394
underbelly of every major city in the world.

00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:45.892
It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:48.047
it is workers from all over the world.

00:13:48.047 --> 00:13:49.985
It is not only men.

00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:51.870
Women are especially vulnerable to

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.408
recruitment malpractices.

00:13:55.408 --> 00:14:00.002
One of the most exciting and newest

00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:02.420
thing happening in the area of remittances

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.461
is how to mobilize, through innovation,

00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:08.652
diaspora saving and diaspora giving.

00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:10.535
Migrants send money home,

00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:12.168
but they also save a large amount of

00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:14.613
money where they live.

00:14:14.613 --> 00:14:17.248
Annually, migrant savings are estimated

00:14:17.248 --> 00:14:21.349
to be 500 billion dollars.

00:14:21.349 --> 00:14:23.577
Most of that money is parked in

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:27.302
bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.

00:14:27.302 --> 00:14:30.394
If a country were to come 
and offer a three percent

00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.905
or four percent interest rate, and then say

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.709
that the money would be used for building schools,

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.844
roads, airports, train systems

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.656
in the country of origin, a lot

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.593
of migrants would be interested in

00:14:42.593 --> 00:14:44.983
parting with their money because

00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:46.778
it's not only financial gains that

00:14:46.778 --> 00:14:48.067
give them an opportunity

00:14:48.067 --> 00:14:53.539
to stay engaged with their country's development.

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:55.480
Remittance channels can be used

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.051
to sell these bonds to migrants

00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.402
because when they come

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:02.985
on a monthly basis to send remittances,

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.566
that's when you can actually sell
it to them.

00:15:05.566 --> 00:15:06.539
You can also do the same

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.320
for mobilizing diaspora giving.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.158
I would love to invest in a

00:15:12.158 --> 00:15:14.538
bullet train system in India

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:17.440
and I would love to contribute to efforts

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.356
to fight malaria in my village.

00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:25.345
Remittances are a great way of

00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:29.116
sharing prosperity between places

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:31.412
in a targeted way that benefits

00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:34.348
those who need them most.

00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:37.506
Remittances empower people.

00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:40.614
We must do all we can to make remittances

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:41.599
and recruitment

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:43.751
safer and cheaper.

00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:46.862
And it can be done.

00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:48.962
As for myself, I have been

00:15:48.962 --> 00:15:52.982
away from India for two decades now.

00:15:52.982 --> 00:15:55.015
My wife is a Venezuelan.

00:15:55.015 --> 00:15:58.913
My children are Americans.

00:15:58.913 --> 00:16:02.860
Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.190
And yet, I am growing nostalgic

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.142
about my country of birth.

00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:13.338
I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.561
My parents are not there anymore.

00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.063
My brothers and sisters have moved on.

00:16:19.063 --> 00:16:21.597
There is no real urgency for me to send money home.

00:16:21.597 --> 00:16:24.219
And yet, from time to time,

00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:27.070
I send money home to friends,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.911
to relatives, to the village,

00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:32.147
to be there, to stay engaged â€”

00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:34.195
that's part of my identity.

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:37.435
And, I'm still striving to be a poet

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:39.803
for the hardworking migrants

00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:41.340
and their struggle to break free

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.628
of the cycle of poverty.

00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:44.402
Thank you.

00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:50.846
(Applause)
