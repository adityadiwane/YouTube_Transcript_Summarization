00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and I met a 12-year-old boy

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
who had been tortured

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and was denied access to counsel.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that for the hundreds of letters I had written

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
for political prisoners, that I would never have

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
written a letter for him,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
because he was not a 12-year-old boy who

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
had done something important for anybody.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
He was not a political prisoner.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
He was a 12-year-old boy who had

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
stolen a bicycle.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
What I also realized at that point was that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
it was not only Cambodia, but

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
of the 113

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
developing countries that torture,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
93 of these countries have all passed laws

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that say you have a right to a lawyer

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and you have a right not to be tortured.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And what I recognized was that there was an

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
incredible window of opportunity for us

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
as a world community to come together

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and end torture as an investigative tool.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
We often think of torture as being

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
political torture or reserved for

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
just the worst, but, in fact,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
95 percent of torture today

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
is not for political prisoners.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
It is for people who are

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
in broken-down legal systems,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and unfortunately because torture is

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
the cheapest form of investigation --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
it's cheaper than having a legal system,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
cheaper than having a lawyer

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and early access to counsel --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
it is what happens most of the time.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I believe today that it is possible for us

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
as a world community, if we make a decision,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
to come together and end torture

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
as an investigative tool in our lifetime,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
but it will require three things.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
First is the training, empowerment,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and connection of defenders worldwide.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
The second is insuring that there is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
systematic early access to counsel.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And the third is commitment.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So in the year 2000,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I began to wonder,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
what if we came together?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Could we do something

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
for these 93 countries?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And I founded International Bridges to Justice

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
which has a specific mission of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
ending torture as an investigative tool

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and implementing due process rights

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
at an early stage in police stations

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and in courtrooms.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
My first experiences, though, did come

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
from Cambodia, and at the time I remember

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
first coming to Cambodia and there were,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in 1994, still less than

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
10 attorneys in the country because

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And even 20 years later, there was only

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
10 lawyers in the country, so consequently

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
you'd walk into a prison and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
you'd meet women and you'd say,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
"Why are you here?" Women would say,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
"Well I've been here for 10 years because

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The first group of defenders came together

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and I still remember, as I was training, I said,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And there was silence in the class, and finally

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
one woman stood up, [inaudible name],

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
She said, "I have defended more than

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
a hundred people, and I've never had to do

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
any investigation,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
because they all come with confessions."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
number one, the confessions

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
might not be reliable, but number two,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
we did not want to encourage the police

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to keep doing this, especially

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
as it was now against the law.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And it took a lot of courage for these

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
defenders to decide that they would

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
begin to stand up and support each other

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in implementing these laws.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And I still remember the first cases where

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
they came, all 25 together, she would

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
stand up, and they were in the back, and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
they would support her, and the judges kept

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the exact same way we've been doing them."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
But one day the perfect case came, and it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
was a woman who was a vegetable seller,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
she was sitting outside of a house.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
She said she actually saw the person

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
run out who she thinks stole

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
whatever the jewelry was, but the police

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
came, they got her, there was nothing on her.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
She was pregnant at the time. She had

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And when they brought her case

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
to the judge, for the first time he stood up

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
except for your torture confession

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and you will be released."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And the defenders began to take cases

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
over and over again and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
you will see, they have step by step began

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
to change the course of history in Cambodia.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But Cambodia is not alone.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Or is it other countries?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
But it is in so many countries.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
for stealing a mobile phone.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Or a woman, I picked up her baby,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
It wasn't a baby, she was three.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
because she was accused of stealing

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
two diapers and an iron for her baby and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
still had been in prison.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And when I walked up to the prison director,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I said, "You've got to let her out.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
A judge would let her out."

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
but look at my prison. Eighty percent

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
of the two thousand people here

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
are without a lawyer. What can we do?"

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So lawyers began to courageously

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
stand up together to organize a system

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
where they can take cases.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But we realized that it's not only the training

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
of the lawyers, but the connection

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
of the lawyers that makes a difference.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
For example, in Cambodia, it was that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
[inaudible name] did not go alone

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
but she had 24 lawyers with her

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
who stood up together. And in the same way,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
in China, they always tell me,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
"It's like a fresh wind in the desert

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
when we can come together."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
after coming out of a prison where everybody

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
stood up and said, "I've been here

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
for one year, eight years, 12 years

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
without a lawyer,"

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
he came and we had a training together

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and he said, "I have heard it said" --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
because he had heard people mumbling

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
we cannot help to create justice

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
because we do not have the resources."

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And then he said, "But I want you to know

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that the lack of resources

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
is never an excuse for injustice."

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And with that, he successfully

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
organized 68 lawyers who have been

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
systematically taking the cases.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
The key that we see, though, is training

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and then early access.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
to meet with another group of lawyers,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and what they told me is that they said,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
"Hey, look, we don't have police

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
on the streets now. The police are

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
one of the main reasons why we had

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
the revolution. They were torturing everybody

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
all the time."

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
of dollars that have recently gone in

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
to the development of the legal system here.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
What's going on?"

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
I met with one of the development agencies,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and they were training prosecutors

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and judges, which is the normal bias,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
as opposed to defenders.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And they showed me a manual which

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
actually was an excellent manual.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
at the police station. It was perfect.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
But I said to them, "I just have one question,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
which is, by the time that everybody got to

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And after a pause, they said,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
"They had been tortured."

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
So the pieces are,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
not only the training of the lawyers, but

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
us finding a way to systematically implement

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
early access to counsel, because they are

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
the safeguard in the system

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
for people who are being tortured.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
like we could do it, but can we really do it?"

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Because it sounds big.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The first reason is the people on the ground

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
who find ways of creating miracles

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
because of their commitment.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
who are looking for these pieces.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
We have a program called JusticeMakers,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and we realized there are people that are

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
courageous and want to do things, but

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
how can we support them?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
So it's an online contest where it's only

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
five thousand dollars if you come up with

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and innovative way of implementing justice.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And there are 30 JusticeMakers

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
throughout the world, from Sri Lanka

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to Swaziland to the DRC, who with

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
five thousand dollars do amazing things,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
through SMS programs,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
through paralegal programs,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
through whatever they can do.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And it's not only these JusticeMakers,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
but people we courageously see

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
figure out who their networks are

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and how they can move it forward.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So in China, for instance, great laws

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
came out where it says police cannot

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
torture people or they will be punished.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And I was sitting side by side with one of our

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
very courageous lawyers, and said,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
"How can we get this out? How can we

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
make sure that this is implemented?

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
This is fantastic." And he said to me,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
"Well, do you have money?" And I said,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
"No." And he said, "That's okay,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
we can still figure it out."

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And on December 4, he organized

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
three thousand members

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
of the Youth Communist League,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
from 14 of the top law schools,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
who organized themselves, developed

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
posters with the new laws, and went

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to the police stations and began what he says

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
is a non-violent legal revolution

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to protect citizen rights.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So I talked about the fact that we need

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
to train and support defenders.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
We need to systematically implement

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
early access to counsel.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
But the third and most important thing is that

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
we make a commitment to this.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And people often say to me, "You know,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Never going to happen."

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And the reason that I think that

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
those words are interesting is because

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
those were the same kinds of words

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that were used for people who decided

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
they would end slavery, or end apartheid.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
It began with a small group of people

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
who decided they would commit.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Now, there's one of our favorite poems

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
from the defenders, which they share

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
from each other, is:

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
"Take courage friends, the road is often long,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
the path is never clear,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and the stakes are very high,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
but deep down, you are not alone."

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And I believe that if we can come together

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
as a world community to support not only

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
defenders, but also everyone in the system

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
who is looking towards it,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
we can end torture as an investigative tool.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and I'd be happy to talk to you

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
at any point -- "But what can I really do?"

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Well, I would say this. First of all,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
you know what you can do. But second of all,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I would leave you with the story of Vishna,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
who actually was my inspiration

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
for starting International Bridges to Justice.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
who was born in a Cambodian prison

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
in Kandal Province. But because he was

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
born in the prison, everybody loved him,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
including the guards, so he was the only one

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
who was allowed to come

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
in and out of the bars.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
that Vishna was getting bigger,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
So he would come to the first bar,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
the second bar and then the third bar,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and then really slowly move his head

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
so he could fit through, and come back,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
third, second, first. And he would

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
grab my pinkie, because what he wanted

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
to do every day is he wanted to go visit.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
You know, he never quite made it to

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
all of them every day, but he wanted to visit

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and he would put his fingers through.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And most of the prisoners said that he was

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
looked forward to him. And I was like,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
He was born in a prison with almost nothing,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
no material goods, but he had a sense of

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
his own heroic journey, which I believe

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
we are all born into. He said,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
"Probably I can't do everything.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
But I'm one. I can do something.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And I will do the one thing that I can do."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
So I thank you for having the prophetic

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
imagination to imagine the shaping

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
of a new world with us together,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and invite you into this journey with us.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Thank you.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:29.260
(Applause)

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Thank you.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
(Applause)

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Thank you.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
(Applause)
