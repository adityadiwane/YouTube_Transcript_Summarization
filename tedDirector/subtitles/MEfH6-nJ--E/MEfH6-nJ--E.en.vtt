00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
We investigate materials and technologies

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
back into our library and selected six we thought would be most

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
surprising for TED.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
is in the black envelope you're holding.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.160
What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Zach and I have always been fascinated

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
observing unexpected things like this.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
it's when we see something unexpected,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
it changes our understanding of the way things work.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
if you assume that all magnets had to be hard,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
of the way magnets could work.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
For me, I really love this idea.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
(Laughter)

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
If you come to my apartment and see my closet,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
But we've found that the way we present our ideas

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
it makes a big difference.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
He works on mostly music videos and commercials

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
with his company, The Directors Bureau.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
And we were showing him the same

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
he opens it up and Keith and I look in,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.160
at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.160
was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
When we were going in the car back to the airport,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
we were thinking: why was this so powerful?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160
And as we thought about it more, we realized that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
it let you fill in all the details about the experience,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
from the future.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide

00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:00.160
so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
and they asked us, when's it coming out?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
just the concept is.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Now this is important for two reasons.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
When you get to the very bottom of the slide --

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
(Laughter)

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
from a technical standpoint.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
(Laughter)

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160
the greater the stopping force.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
and I have it right here in my pocket.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
(Laughter)

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
There're a few different versions of it.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160
(Laughter)

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
he was telling us that, in the military they use this one

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
to clearly send signals back to the base.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
(Laughter)

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
(Laughter)

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
off my house -- I do it that way.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
Woman: An olive server.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
and you could swim easier ... Yeah.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
(Laughter)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
and so we need a volunteer from the audience.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160
You sir, come on up.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.160
(Laughter)

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
Come on up. Tell everybody your name.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Steve Jurvetson: Steve.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
ZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Right there. That's great.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
And hold onto this. Good luck to you.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
(Laughter)

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160
KS: No, not yet.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.160
(Laughter)

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160
has been brought to you by Target.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
a water gun fight from the future.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.160
(Laughter)

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
So here, come on up to the front. All right, so

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
now if you'll see here -- no, no, it's OK.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160
So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
SJ: It's cold.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.160
It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
(Laughter)

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
25 times faster than water.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
(Laughter)

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
All right, well thanks for coming up.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
(Laughter)

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160
so during the break you can shoot your friends.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
SJ: Excellent, thank you.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
(Applause)

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
So what's the significance of this dry liquid?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
Now, the unexpected thing about this

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
You can circulate it to draw the heat away.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
But today it's most widely used in office buildings --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160
But our favorite idea for this

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160
was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&amp;D engineers

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160
We have a video to show you.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and it holds its place. Contrast that with

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
and it always bounces back.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
but doesn't use a buckle.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Taking it a little further, if you wove

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
For our next technology, it's hard to observe

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
Now, to think about the potential for this,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
you could change the way you interact with it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
based on the curvature of the pages.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.160
the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
to explain how it works.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
Who are you?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
OMC: I used to smell like you.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
Don't let milk spoil your morning.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And these dyes change color in response to odors.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.160
beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
And he kind of comically explained that

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
time after time, what the firemen would say is:

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
(Laughter)

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
(Laughter)

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
But more seriously, they determined that you could develop

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
a device that can smell better than the humans,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
and say if it's safe for the firemen.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
where they're working on medical equipment.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
software to analyze the results.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Currently, they're using a method of trial and error,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
why we find these things so fascinating.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Because every one of these six changed our understanding

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.160
every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160
I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.160
the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
And you know, his son was mesmerized,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
that there were some drops of water on the hair.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
"Look, hydrophobic string."

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
(Laughter)

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160
KS: Thank you.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
(Applause)
