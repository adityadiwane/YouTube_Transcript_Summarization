00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Can geographic information

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
make you healthy?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
In 2001 I got hit by a train.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
My train was a heart attack.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I found myself in a hospital

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in an intensive-care ward,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
recuperating from emergency surgery.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And I suddenly realized something:

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that I was completely in the dark.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
"Why now?" "Why here?"

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
"Could my doctor have warned me?"

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.260
is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
That's going to sort of contain our risks,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and if we manage those risks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And you know why I understand that?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Because my physicians constantly

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
ask me questions about this.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Have you ever had to fill out those long,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
legal-size forms in your doctor's office?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.260
(Laughter)

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
about your lifestyle and your family history,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
your medication history, your surgical history,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
your allergy history ... did I forget any history?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
But this part of the equation I didn't really get,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and I don't think my physicians

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
really get this part of the equation.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
What does that mean, my environment?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Well, it can mean a lot of things.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
This is my life. These are my life places.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
We all have these.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
How many places have you lived?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Just think about that, you know, wander through

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
your life thinking about this.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
traveling some place.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So, it's not really simple

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and where do you spend all your time?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And where do you expose yourselves to risks

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Well, when I have done this on myself,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I always come to the conclusion

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
that I spend about 75 percent of my time

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
relatively in a small number of places.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And I don't wander far from that place

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
for a majority of my time,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260
even though I'm an extensive global trekker.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but this is where I spent my first 19 years

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
with my little young lungs.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
You know, breathing high concentrations here

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and methane gas,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And if you've been in that part of the country,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.260
this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So then I decided to leave that part of the world,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and I was going to go to the mid-west.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and benzene.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
breathing various concentrations of that.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
It was insidious and it was really happening.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Then I decided I had to get really smart,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I would take this job in the West Coast.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And I moved to Redlands California.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Very nice, and there

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.260
I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
So, what's wrong with this picture?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
They never ask me about my place history.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
"Where have you lived?"

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
of the drinking water that I put in my mouth

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
or the food that I ingest into my stomach.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They really don't do that. It's missing.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Look at the kind of data that's available.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
This data's from all over the world --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.260
countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.260
I'd been in the right places. Right?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So, how many people are in the white?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
in the white space?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
How many have spent it in the red places?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Oh, not so lucky.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
There are thousands of these kinds of maps

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that are displayed in atlases

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
all over the world.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
They give us some sense of what's going

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to be our train wreck.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But none of that's in my medical record.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And it's not in yours either.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So, here's my friend Paul.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
every two hours, 24/7,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
365 days out of the year

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
for the last two years, everywhere he went.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And this is where he has spent most of his time.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
If you really studied that you might have some clues

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
as to what Paul likes to do.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And all of those black dots are all of the

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
toxic release inventories

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that are monitored by the EPA.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Did you know that data existed?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
For every community in the United States,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
you could have your own personalized map of that.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
So, our cell phones can now build a place history.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
This might be what we end up with.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
This is what the physician would have

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
in front of him and her when we enter that exam room

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
This could be my little assessment.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And he looks at that and he says,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
"Whoa Bill,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I suggest that maybe you not decide,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
just because you're out here in beautiful California,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and it's warm every day,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
because of this report."

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
about the value of geographical information.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.260
It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that are focused on this.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And they're in the early stages of development.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
These programs need to be supported,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and we need to teach our future

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
doctors of the world

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
the importance of some of the information

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
I've shared here with you today.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
The second thing we need to do

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
is while we're spending billions and billions

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
of dollars all over the world

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
building an electronic health record,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
we make sure we put a place history

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
inside that medical record.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
It not only will be important for the physician;

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
it will be important for the researchers

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that now will have huge samples to draw upon.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
But it will also be useful for us.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I could have made the decision, if I had this information,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
not to move to the ozone capital

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Or I could negotiate with my employer

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
to make that decision

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:28.260
in the best interest of myself and my company.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
this almost 10 years ago.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Just look at that for a minute.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
That was what the conclusion

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
was saying that we can explain the geographic variations

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and how our healthcare system actually operates.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
That was what he was talking about

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
on that quote.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So, I'd very much like to see us begin to

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So with that, I'll leave you that

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.260
in my particular view of view of health:

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Geography always matters.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And I believe that geographic information

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
(Applause)
