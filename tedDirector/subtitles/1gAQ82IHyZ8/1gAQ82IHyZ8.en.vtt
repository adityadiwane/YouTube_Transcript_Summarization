00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.991
When the Industrial Revolution started,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.073
the amount of carbon sitting
underneath Britain in the form of coal

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:23.083
was as big as the amount of carbon
sitting under Saudi Arabia

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:24.445
in the form of oil.

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.966
This carbon powered
the Industrial Revolution,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.705
it put the "Great" in Great Britain,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.013
and led to Britain's temporary
world domination.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:38.506
And then, in 1918,
coal production in Britain peaked,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.297
and has declined ever since.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:45.056
In due course, Britain started using
oil and gas from the North Sea,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.991
and in the year 2000,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.514
oil and gas production
from the North Sea also peaked,

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.684
and they're now on the decline.

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:56.799
These observations about the finiteness

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.690
of easily accessible, local,
secure fossil fuels,

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:04.377
is a motivation for saying,
"Well, what's next?

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:07.324
What is life after fossil fuels
going to be like?

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:10.814
Shouldn't we be thinking hard
about how to get off fossil fuels?"

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:13.802
Another motivation,
of course, is climate change.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:16.815
And when people talk
about life after fossil fuels

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:18.710
and climate change action,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.280
I think there's a lot of fluff,

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:24.168
a lot of greenwash,
a lot of misleading advertising,

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:28.681
and I feel a duty as a physicist to try
to guide people around the claptrap

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:32.479
and help people understand the actions
that really make a difference,

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:35.153
and to focus on ideas that do add up.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.589
Let me illustrate this

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:41.796
with what physicists call
a back-of-envelope calculation.

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:44.073
We love back-of-envelope calculations.

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:46.168
You ask a question,
write down some numbers,

00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:47.355
and get an answer.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.579
It may not be very accurate,
but it may make you say, "Hmm."

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:52.025
So here's a question:

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.252
Imagine if we said, "Oh yes,
we can get off fossil fuels.

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:56.944
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.

00:01:56.968 --> 00:01:59.248
Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:05.706
Well, what if we grew
the biofuels for a road

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.504
on the grass verge
at the edge of the road?

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:13.487
How wide would the verge
have to be for that to work out?

00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.159
OK, so let's put in some numbers.

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:17.893
Let's have our cars go
at 60 miles per hour.

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:19.727
Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.586
That's the European average for new cars.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.263
Let's say the productivity
of biofuel plantations

00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:28.387
is 1,200 liters of biofuel
per hectare per year.

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.982
That's true of European biofuels.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.891
And let's imagine the cars are spaced
80 meters apart from each other,

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:37.091
and they're perpetually
going along this road.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.955
The length of the road doesn't matter,

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.710
because the longer the road,
the more biofuel plantation.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:43.322
What do we do with these numbers?

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.375
Take the first number, divide by the other
three, and get eight kilometers.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.555
And that's the answer.

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.939
That's how wide the plantation
would have to be,

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:52.814
given these assumptions.

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:56.029
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:58.484
Maybe this isn't going
to be quite so easy."

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.384
And it might make you think,

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:05.267
perhaps there's an issue to do with areas.

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.188
And in this talk, I'd like to talk
about land areas, and ask:

00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:10.695
Is there an issue about areas?

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.379
The answer is going to be yes,
but it depends which country you are in.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.441
So let's start in the United Kingdom,

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:19.757
since that's where we are today.

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.126
The energy consumption
of the United Kingdom,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.837
the total energy consumption --
not just transport, but everything --

00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:28.364
I like to quantify it in lightbulbs.

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:31.870
It's as if we've all got
125 lightbulbs on all the time,

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:35.570
125 kilowatt-hours per day per person

00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:38.284
is the energy consumption of the UK.

00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:41.454
So there's 40 lightbulbs'
worth for transport,

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:43.130
40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,

00:03:43.154 --> 00:03:45.682
and 40 lightbulbs' worth
for making electricity,

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:47.620
and other things are relatively small,

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.277
compared to those three big fish.

00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:53.031
It's actually a bigger footprint
if we take into account

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:56.677
the embodied energy in the stuff
we import into our country as well.

00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:01.435
And 90 percent of this energy, today,
still comes from fossil fuels,

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.137
and 10 percent, only, from other,
greener -- possibly greener -- sources,

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.134
like nuclear power and renewables.

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:09.518
So.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:10.799
That's the UK.

00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:16.044
The population density of the UK
is 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:19.330
I'm now going to show you other countries
by these same two measures.

00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:22.490
On the vertical axis, I'm going
to show you how many lightbulbs --

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:24.954
what our energy consumption per person is.

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:27.097
We're at 125 lightbulbs per person,

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.735
and that little blue dot there
is showing you the land area

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.449
of the United Kingdom.

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:35.262
The population density
is on the horizontal axis,

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:38.009
and we're 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.602
Let's add European countries in blue,

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.127
and you can see there's quite a variety.

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.228
I should emphasize,
both of these axes are logarithmic;

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:48.807
as you go from one gray bar
to the next gray bar,

00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.586
you're going up a factor of 10.

00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:53.888
Next, let's add Asia in red,

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:56.398
the Middle East and North Africa in green,

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:59.806
sub-Saharan Africa in blue,

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.847
black is South America,

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:06.239
purple is Central America,

00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:09.788
and then in pukey-yellow,
we have North America,

00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:11.529
Australia and New Zealand.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.350
You can see the great diversity
of population densities

00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:17.961
and of per capita consumptions.

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.556
Countries are different from each other.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.136
Top left, we have Canada and Australia,
with enormous land areas,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.648
very high per capita consumption --
200 or 300 lightbulbs per person --

00:05:28.672 --> 00:05:31.509
and very low population densities.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.492
Top right: Bahrain has
the same energy consumption

00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:37.499
per person, roughly, as Canada --

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:39.765
over 300 lightbulbs per person,

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.811
but their population density
is a factor of 300 times greater,

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:44.664
1,000 people per square kilometer.

00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:49.565
Bottom right: Bangladesh has
the same population density as Bahrain,

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.440
but consumes 100 times less per person.

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:55.662
Bottom left: well, there's no one.

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.782
But there used to be
a whole load of people.

00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:59.759
Here's another message from this diagram.

00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:03.149
I've added on little blue tails
behind Sudan, Libya,

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:04.684
China, India, Bangladesh.

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:06.843
That's 15 years of progress.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.388
Where were they 15 years ago,
and where are they now?

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:10.570
And the message is,

00:06:10.594 --> 00:06:13.467
most countries are going to the right,
and they're going up.

00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.638
Up and to the right:
bigger population density

00:06:15.662 --> 00:06:17.602
and higher per capita consumption.

00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:21.581
So, we may be off in the top
right-hand corner, slightly unusual,

00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:23.992
the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.986
Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.375
and a bunch of other
slightly odd countries,

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.704
but many other countries are coming
up and to the right to join us.

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:34.771
So we're a picture, if you like,

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.770
of what the future energy consumption

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:39.566
might be looking
like in other countries, too.

00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:43.892
I've also added in this diagram
now some pink lines

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:45.805
that go down and to the right.

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:49.670
Those are lines of equal
power consumption per unit area,

00:06:49.694 --> 00:06:51.765
which I measure in watts per square meter.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.636
So, for example, the middle line there,
0.1 watts per square meter,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.512
is the energy consumption
per unit area of Saudi Arabia,

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:03.717
Norway, Mexico in purple,
and Bangladesh 15 years ago.

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.826
Half of the world's population
lives in countries

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.955
that are already above that line.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.902
The United Kingdom is consuming
1.25 watts per square meter.

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:19.948
So is Germany, and Japan
is consuming a bit more.

00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:25.188
So, let's now say why this is relevant.

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:26.599
Why is it relevant?

00:07:26.623 --> 00:07:29.489
Well, we can measure
renewables in the same units

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:32.318
and other forms of power
production in the same units.

00:07:32.728 --> 00:07:35.471
Renewables is one of the leading ideas

00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:39.469
for how we could get off
our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.

00:07:39.802 --> 00:07:41.214
So here come some renewables.

00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:43.898
Energy crops deliver
half a watt per square meter

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.279
in European climates.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:47.860
What does that mean?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.866
You might have anticipated that result,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.078
given what I told you about the biofuel
plantation a moment ago.

00:07:53.102 --> 00:07:56.098
Well, we consume 1.25 watts
per square meter.

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:57.279
What this means is,

00:07:57.303 --> 00:08:00.690
even if you covered the whole
of the United Kingdom with energy crops,

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:03.522
you couldn't match
today's energy consumption.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:08.470
Wind power produces a bit more --
2.5 watts per square meter.

00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:12.507
But that's only twice as big
as 1.25 watts per square meter.

00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:17.165
So that means if you wanted, literally,
to produce total energy consumption

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.420
in all forms, on average, from wind farms,

00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:22.076
you need wind farms
half the area of the UK.

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:27.000
I've got data to back up
all these assertions, by the way.

00:08:27.643 --> 00:08:29.552
Next, let's look at solar power.

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.137
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof,

00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:36.476
deliver about 20 watts
per square meter in England.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.282
If you really want to get
a lot from solar panels,

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:43.110
you need to adopt the traditional
Bavarian farming method,

00:08:43.134 --> 00:08:44.485
where you leap off the roof,

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.013
and coat the countryside
with solar panels, too.

00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:50.233
Solar parks, because of the gaps
between the panels, deliver less.

00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:53.664
They deliver about 5 watts
per square meter of land area.

00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:56.990
And here's a solar park
in Vermont, with real data,

00:08:57.014 --> 00:08:59.538
delivering 4.2 watts per square meter.

00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:02.968
Remember where we are,
1.25 watts per square meter,

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:06.043
wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.

00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:10.327
So whichever of those renewables you pick,

00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.900
the message is, whatever mix
of those renewables you're using,

00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:16.105
if you want to power the UK on them,

00:09:16.129 --> 00:09:18.230
you're going to need
to cover something like

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:21.112
20 percent or 25 percent of the country

00:09:21.136 --> 00:09:22.775
with those renewables.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.662
I'm not saying that's a bad idea;
we just need to understand the numbers.

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:29.258
I'm absolutely not anti-renewables.
I love renewables.

00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:30.918
But I'm also pro-arithmetic.

00:09:30.942 --> 00:09:32.647
(Laughter)

00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.803
Concentrating solar power in deserts
delivers larger powers per unit area,

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.178
because you don't have
the problem of clouds.

00:09:39.202 --> 00:09:42.406
So, this facility delivers
14 watts per square meter;

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.141
this one 10 watts per square meter;

00:09:44.165 --> 00:09:46.921
and this one in Spain,
5 watts per square meter.

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.119
Being generous
to concentrating solar power,

00:09:49.143 --> 00:09:52.807
I think it's perfectly credible it could
deliver 20 watts per square meter.

00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:53.997
So that's nice.

00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:56.573
Of course, Britain
doesn't have any deserts.

00:09:56.955 --> 00:09:58.111
Yet.

00:09:58.135 --> 00:09:59.820
(Laughter)

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:02.209
So here's a summary so far:

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.659
All renewables, much
as I love them, are diffuse.

00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:07.722
They all have a small power per unit area,

00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:09.541
and we have to live with that fact.

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:15.563
And that means, if you do want renewables
to make a substantial difference

00:10:15.587 --> 00:10:17.375
for a country like the United Kingdom

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.491
on the scale of today's consumption,

00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:23.916
you need to be imagining renewable
facilities that are country-sized.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.253
Not the entire country,

00:10:25.277 --> 00:10:28.644
but a fraction of the country,
a substantial fraction.

00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:32.231
There are other options
for generating power as well,

00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:33.939
which don't involve fossil fuels.

00:10:33.963 --> 00:10:37.118
So there's nuclear power,
and on this ordinance survey map,

00:10:37.142 --> 00:10:40.881
you can see there's a Sizewell B
inside a blue square kilometer.

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.908
That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,

00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:45.357
which works out to 1,000 watts
per square meter.

00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:47.517
So by this particular metric,

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:52.736
nuclear power isn't
as intrusive as renewables.

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:55.317
Of course, other metrics matter, too,

00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:58.051
and nuclear power has
all sorts of popularity problems.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:01.001
But the same goes for renewables as well.

00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:03.853
Here's a photograph of a consultation
exercise in full swing

00:11:03.877 --> 00:11:06.565
in the little town of Penicuik
just outside Edinburgh,

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:09.083
and you can see the children
of Penicuik celebrating

00:11:09.107 --> 00:11:11.477
the burning of the effigy of the windmill.

00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:12.660
So --

00:11:12.684 --> 00:11:13.734
(Laughter)

00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:15.087
People are anti-everything,

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:17.769
and we've got to keep
all the options on the table.

00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:21.967
What can a country like the UK
do on the supply side?

00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.910
Well, the options are,
I'd say, these three:

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.112
power renewables,

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:29.847
and recognizing that they need
to be close to country-sized;

00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:31.117
other people's renewables,

00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.268
so we could go back and talk very politely

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:36.329
to the people in the top left-hand side
of the diagram and say,

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:38.604
"Uh, we don't want
renewables in our backyard,

00:11:38.628 --> 00:11:41.222
but, um, please could we put
them in yours instead?"

00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:43.211
And that's a serious option.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:46.819
It's a way for the world
to handle this issue.

00:11:46.843 --> 00:11:50.975
So countries like Australia,
Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:53.999
could be our best friends
for renewable production.

00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:57.392
And a third option is nuclear power.

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.632
So that's some supply-side options.

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:02.948
In addition to the supply levers
that we can push --

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.007
and remember, we need large amounts,

00:12:05.031 --> 00:12:08.558
because at the moment, we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels --

00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:09.942
in addition to those levers,

00:12:09.966 --> 00:12:13.017
we could talk about other ways
of solving this issue.

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:16.437
Namely, we could reduce demand,
and that means reducing population --

00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:18.276
I'm not sure how to do that --

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.112
or reducing per capita consumption.

00:12:21.136 --> 00:12:23.599
So let's talk about three more big levers

00:12:23.623 --> 00:12:25.949
that could really help
on the consumption side.

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:27.127
First, transport.

00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:28.694
Here are the physics principles

00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:31.768
that tell you how to reduce
the energy consumption of transport.

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:34.238
People often say,
"Technology can answer everything.

00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:37.038
We can make vehicles
that are 100 times more efficient."

00:12:37.062 --> 00:12:39.042
And that's almost true. Let me show you.

00:12:39.066 --> 00:12:41.534
The energy consumption
of this typical tank here

00:12:41.558 --> 00:12:44.982
is 80 kilowatt hours
per hundred person kilometers.

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:48.801
That's the average European car.

00:12:49.347 --> 00:12:50.498
Eighty kilowatt hours.

00:12:50.522 --> 00:12:52.610
Can we make something 100 times better

00:12:52.634 --> 00:12:54.947
by applying the physics
principles I just listed?

00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:56.614
Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.

00:12:56.638 --> 00:12:59.284
It's 80 times better
in energy consumption,

00:12:59.308 --> 00:13:01.532
and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.

00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:03.694
(Laughter)

00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:05.585
And there are other options in between,

00:13:05.609 --> 00:13:07.736
because maybe the lady
in the tank would say,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.916
"No, that's a lifestyle change.
Don't change my lifestyle, please."

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.587
We could persuade her to take a train,
still a lot more efficient than a car,

00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:16.386
but that might be a lifestyle change.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.994
Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left.

00:13:18.018 --> 00:13:21.753
It comfortably accommodates one teenager
and it's shorter than a traffic cone,

00:13:21.777 --> 00:13:23.813
and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.877
as long as you drive it
at 15 miles per hour.

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:29.526
In between, perhaps
some more realistic options

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.515
on the transport lever
are electric vehicles,

00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:34.918
so electric bikes
and electric cars in the middle,

00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:39.968
perhaps four times as energy efficient
as the standard petrol-powered tank.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.676
Next, there's the heating lever.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.191
Heating is a third of our energy
consumption in Britain,

00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:48.288
and quite a lot of that
is going into homes

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:49.695
and other buildings,

00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:51.696
doing space heating and water heating.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.004
So here's a typical crappy British house.

00:13:54.028 --> 00:13:56.747
It's my house, with a Ferrari out front.

00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:57.836
(Laughter)

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.013
What can we do to it?

00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:02.698
Well, the laws of physics
are written up there,

00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:07.970
which describe how the power
consumption for heating

00:14:07.994 --> 00:14:09.902
is driven by the things you can control.

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:12.820
The things you can control
are the temperature difference

00:14:12.844 --> 00:14:14.527
between the inside and the outside.

00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:17.165
There's this remarkable technology
called a thermostat:

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.925
you grasp it, rotate it to the left,

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:21.478
and your energy consumption
in the home will decrease.

00:14:21.502 --> 00:14:24.605
I've tried it. It works.
Some people call it a lifestyle change.

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:25.713
(Laughter)

00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:29.217
You can also get the fluff men
in to reduce the leakiness

00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:32.210
of your building -- put fluff
in the walls, fluff in the roof,

00:14:32.234 --> 00:14:34.028
a new front door, and so forth.

00:14:35.452 --> 00:14:38.037
The sad truth is,
this will save you money.

00:14:38.061 --> 00:14:39.401
That's not sad, that's good.

00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:40.603
But the sad truth is,

00:14:40.627 --> 00:14:43.826
it'll only get about 25 percent
of the leakiness of your building

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.545
if you do these things,
which are good ideas.

00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:49.828
If you really want to get a bit closer
to Swedish building standards

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:51.502
with a crappy house like this,

00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:54.972
you need to be putting
external insulation on the building,

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:57.268
as shown by this block of flats in London.

00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:01.657
You can also deliver heat
more efficiently using heat pumps,

00:15:01.681 --> 00:15:05.151
which use a smaller bit
of high-grade energy like electricity

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.740
to move heat from your garden
into your house.

00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:11.046
The third demand-side option
I want to talk about,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.216
the third way to reduce energy
consumption is: read your meters.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.069
People talk a lot about smart meters,

00:15:16.093 --> 00:15:17.440
but you can do it yourself.

00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:19.389
Use your own eyes and be smart.

00:15:19.413 --> 00:15:23.076
Read your meter, and if you're anything
like me, it'll change your life.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.532
Here's a graph I made.

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:26.700
I was writing a book
about sustainable energy,

00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:27.878
and a friend asked me,

00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:29.716
"How much energy do you use at home?"

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.760
I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.

00:15:31.784 --> 00:15:33.985
And so I started reading
the meter every week.

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:37.801
The old meter readings are shown
in the top half of the graph,

00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:40.050
and then 2007 is shown
in green at the bottom.

00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:42.396
That was when I was reading
the meter every week.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.586
And my life changed,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.965
because I started doing experiments
and seeing what made a difference.

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:48.394
My gas consumption plummeted,

00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:50.637
because I started tinkering
with the thermostat

00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:52.460
and the timing on the heating system,

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:54.697
and I knocked more than half
off my gas bills.

00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:57.604
There's a similar story
for my electricity consumption,

00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:01.190
where switching off the DVD
players, the stereos,

00:16:01.214 --> 00:16:04.008
the computer peripherals
that were on all the time,

00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:06.227
and just switching them on
when I needed them,

00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:08.876
knocked another third
off my electricity bills, too.

00:16:10.142 --> 00:16:11.908
So we need a plan that adds up.

00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:14.522
I've described for you six big levers.

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:15.712
We need big action,

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:18.498
because we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels,

00:16:18.522 --> 00:16:22.568
and so you need to push hard
on most, if not all, of these levers.

00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:25.574
Most of these levers
have popularity problems,

00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:29.264
and if there is a lever
you don't like the use of,

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:33.105
well, please do bear in mind
that means you need even stronger effort

00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:35.010
on the other levers.

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:38.607
So I'm a strong advocate
of having grown-up conversations

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.892
that are based on numbers and facts.

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:44.692
And I want to close with this map
that just visualizes for you

00:16:44.716 --> 00:16:48.253
the requirement of land and so forth

00:16:48.277 --> 00:16:51.341
in order to get just
16 lightbulbs per person

00:16:51.365 --> 00:16:54.053
from four of the big possible sources.

00:16:54.474 --> 00:16:57.634
So, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs --

00:16:57.658 --> 00:17:01.979
remember, today our total energy
consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth --

00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:04.226
if you wanted 16 from wind,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.077
this map visualizes a solution for the UK.

00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:11.258
It's got 160 wind farms,
each 100 square kilometers in size,

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:15.166
and that would be a twentyfold increase
over today's amount of wind.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.098
Nuclear power:
to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

00:17:18.122 --> 00:17:21.211
you'd need two gigawatts
at each of the purple dots on the map.

00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:25.418
That's a fourfold increase
over today's levels of nuclear power.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.767
Biomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:33.053
you'd need a land area something
like three and a half Wales' worth,

00:17:33.823 --> 00:17:36.405
either in our country,
or in someone else's country,

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:38.472
possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:39.575
(Laughter)

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.390
And a fourth supply-side option:

00:17:41.414 --> 00:17:44.131
concentrating solar power
in other people's deserts.

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:46.993
If you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:50.032
then we're talking
about these eight hexagons

00:17:50.056 --> 00:17:51.367
down at the bottom right.

00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:55.616
The total area of those hexagons
is two Greater London's worth

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.729
of someone else's Sahara,

00:17:57.753 --> 00:18:00.760
and you'll need power lines
all the way across Spain and France

00:18:00.784 --> 00:18:04.154
to bring the power
from the Sahara to Surrey.

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:05.745
(Laughter)

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:07.363
We need a plan that adds up.

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.797
We need to stop shouting
and start talking.

00:18:12.209 --> 00:18:16.432
And if we can have
a grown-up conversation,

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:18.917
make a plan that adds up and get building,

00:18:18.941 --> 00:18:21.945
maybe this low-carbon revolution
will actually be fun.

00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:23.707
Thank you very much for listening.

00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:26.237
(Applause)
