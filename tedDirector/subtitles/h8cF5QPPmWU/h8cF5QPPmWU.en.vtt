00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:15.070
The year is 1800.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.126
A curious little invention is being talked about.

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:21.207
It's called a microscope.

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.986
What it allows you to do

00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:25.628
is see tiny little lifeforms

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:28.115
that are invisible to the naked eye.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:30.143
Soon comes the medical discovery

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:33.228
that many of these lifeforms are actually causes

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:35.419
of terrible human diseases.

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.204
Imagine what happened to the society

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.192
when they realized

00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:43.008
that an English mom in her teacup

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.144
actually was drinking a monster soup,

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:49.293
not very far from here. This is from London.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:52.135
Fast forward 200 years.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.267
We still have this monster soup around,

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.122
and it's taken hold in the developing countries

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.538
around the tropical belt.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:02.101
Just for malaria itself,

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.546
there are a million deaths a year,

00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:06.292
and more than a billion people

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:08.940
that need to be tested because they are at risk

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.175
for different species of malarial infections.

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:14.986
Now it's actually very simple to put a face

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:16.781
to many of these monsters.

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.408
You take a stain, like acridine orange

00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:21.525
or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.638
and a microscope, and you look at them.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:27.018
They all have faces.

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:29.656
Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya,

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.884
Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:36.305
and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.884
to be able to diagnose why they are sick?

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.910
And that's primarily because scalability

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.942
of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.

00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:49.858
And remember that number: one billion.

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:53.759
The problem lies with the microscope itself.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.135
Even though the pinnacle of modern science,

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:59.270
research microscopes are
not designed for field testing.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.950
Neither were they first designed

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.101
for diagnostics at all.

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:06.489
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.790
and cost a lot of money.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.195
This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:15.489
using the exact same setup
that we actually use today

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.173
for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram

00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:20.618
in Sevagram in India.

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:23.945
Two of my students, Jim and James,

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:26.265
traveled around India and Thailand,

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.517
starting to think about this problem a lot.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:30.992
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:33.904
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.099
And we saw people who had a functional microscope

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.050
but just didn't know how to even turn it on.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.690
What grew out of that work and that trip

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.441
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.264
So what is a Foldscope?

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:50.813
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,

00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:53.943
a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,

00:02:53.943 --> 00:02:55.518
polarization, projection,

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.086
all kinds of advanced microscopy

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:01.301
built purely by folding paper.

00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.162
So, now you think, how is that possible?

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:06.125
I'm going to show you some examples here,

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.926
and we will run through some of them.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:11.710
It starts with a single sheet of paper.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.081
What you see here is all the possible components

00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:19.506
to build a functional bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.315
So, there are three stages:

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:24.064
There is the optical stage, the illumination stage

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:26.532
and the mask-holding stage.

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:28.404
And there are micro optics at the bottom

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:31.278
that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.782
What you do is, you take it on,

00:03:33.782 --> 00:03:36.558
and just like you are playing like a toy,

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:39.645
which it is,

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:43.614
I tab it off,

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.221
and I break it off.

00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:51.945
This paper has no instructions and no languages.

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:54.264
There is a code, a color code embedded,

00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:58.875
that tells you exactly how to
fold that specific microscope.

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:01.524
When it's done, it looks something like this,

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.255
has all the functionalities of a standard microscope,

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.136
just like an XY stage,

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:10.557
a place where a sample slide could go,

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:13.097
for example right here.

00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:14.609
We didn't want to change this,

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.981
because this is the standard

00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:17.834
that's been optimized for over the years,

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:20.530
and many health workers are actually used to this.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.991
So this is what changes,

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:24.158
but the standard stains all remain the same

00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:25.933
for many different diseases.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.865
You pop this in.

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:32.751
There is an XY stage,

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.724
and then there is a focusing stage,

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:36.590
which is a flexure mechanism

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.143
that's built in paper itself that allows us to move

00:04:39.143 --> 00:04:42.124
and focus the lenses by micron steps.

00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:44.257
So what's really interesting about this object,

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:46.140
and my students hate when I do this,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.901
but I'm going to do this anyway,

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:49.857
is these are rugged devices.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:54.434
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:57.386
and really try to stomp on it.

00:04:57.386 --> 00:04:59.761
And they last, even though they're designed

00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:03.224
from a very flexible material, like paper.

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:06.076
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:10.131
send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,

00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:11.900
but here in this envelope

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.291
I have 30 different foldscopes

00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:20.022
of different configurations all in a single folder.

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:21.834
And I'm going to pick one randomly.

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:23.916
This one, it turns out, is actually designed

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:25.479
specifically for malaria,

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.790
because it has the fluorescent filters built

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.887
specifically for diagnosing malaria.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:33.815
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:35.581
comes out of this.

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.520
So up till now, you didn't actually see

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.477
what I would see from one of these setups.

00:05:41.477 --> 00:05:43.158
So what I would like to do is,

00:05:43.158 --> 00:05:44.784
if we could dim the lights, please,

00:05:44.784 --> 00:05:48.449
it turns out foldscopes are
also projection microscopes.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.983
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.736
go to the back of the wall --

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:54.444
and just project, and this way you will see

00:05:54.444 --> 00:05:56.564
exactly what I would see.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.350
What you're looking at --

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.733
(Applause) â€”

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:03.369
This is a cross-section of a compound eye,

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.720
and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.964
I am going through the z-axis.

00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:10.988
You actually see how the lenses are cut together

00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:12.561
in the cross-section pattern.

00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.117
Another example, one of my favorite insects,

00:06:15.117 --> 00:06:17.094
I love to hate this one,

00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:18.875
is a mosquito,

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:22.637
and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:26.000
Right there.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.213
All from the simple setup that I actually described.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:31.986
So my wife has been field testing

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:33.986
some of our microscopes

00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:36.467
by washing my clothes whenever I forget them

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:38.496
in the dryer.

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:41.296
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:43.084
(Laughter) â€”

00:06:43.084 --> 00:06:45.582
right here is just fluorescent water,

00:06:45.582 --> 00:06:47.132
and I don't know if you can actually see this.

00:06:47.132 --> 00:06:49.521
This also shows you how 
the projection scope works.

00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.174
You get to see the beam the 
way it's projected and bent.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.139
Can we get the lights back on again?

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.926
So I'm quickly going to show you,

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:02.975
since I'm running out of time,

00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:05.401
in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,

00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:08.481
the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,

00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:11.603
so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.

00:07:11.603 --> 00:07:14.462
(Applause)

00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:16.557
And what this allows us to do

00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:18.893
is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:20.910
which we call use-and-throw microscopy.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.999
I'm going to give you a quick snapshot

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:24.762
of some of the parts that go in.

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:26.221
Here is a sheet of paper.

00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.310
This is when we were thinking about the idea.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.665
This is an A4 sheet of paper.

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:31.646
These are the three stages that you actually see.

00:07:31.646 --> 00:07:35.076
And the optical components, if you
look at the inset up on the right,

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:37.503
we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses

00:07:37.503 --> 00:07:39.815
in paper itself at really high throughputs,

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:41.674
so it uses a process of self-assembly

00:07:41.674 --> 00:07:42.786
and surface tension

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:46.322
to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.

00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:47.767
So that's where the lenses go.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.379
There are some light sources.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:50.764
And essentially, in the end,

00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:53.942
all the parts line up because of origami,

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:57.213
because of the fact that origami allows us

00:07:57.213 --> 00:08:00.193
micron-scale precision of optical alignment.

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:02.822
So even though this looks like a simple toy,

00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:04.736
the aspects of engineering that go in

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:07.422
something like this are fairly sophisticated.

00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:10.657
So here is another obvious thing that we would do,

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.250
typically, if I was going to show

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.755
that these microscopes are robust,

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:17.593
is go to the third floor and
drop it from the floor itself.

00:08:17.593 --> 00:08:20.916
There it is, and it survives.

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:23.093
So for us, the next step actually

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:24.932
is really finishing our field trials.

00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:27.037
We are starting at the end of the summer.

00:08:27.037 --> 00:08:29.964
We are at a stage where we'll be 
making thousands of microscopes.

00:08:29.964 --> 00:08:32.108
That would be the first time where we would be

00:08:32.108 --> 00:08:34.193
doing field trials with the highest density

00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:36.748
of microscopes ever at a given place.

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.828
We've started collecting data for malaria,

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:42.624
Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:44.718
And I want to leave you with this picture.

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:46.643
I had not anticipated this before,

00:08:46.643 --> 00:08:48.330
but a really interesting link

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.225
between hands-on science education

00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:51.483
and global health.

00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:54.409
What are the tools that we're actually providing

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.589
the kids who are going to fight

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:58.507
this monster soup for tomorrow?

00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.865
I would love for them to be able to just print out

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:02.994
