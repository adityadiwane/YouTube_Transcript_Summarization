00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.395
Twenty-three years ago,

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.150
at the age of 19,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.451
I shot and killed a man.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.594
I was a young drug dealer

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:25.963
with a quick temper

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.018
and a semi-automatic pistol.

00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:32.789
But that wasn't the end of my story.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.930
In fact, it was beginning,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.105
and the 23 years since

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.827
is a story of acknowledgment,

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:46.310
apology and atonement.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.733
But it didn't happen in the way

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.027
that you might imagine or think.

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:52.485
These things occurred in my life

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.628
in a way that was surprising,

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.263
especially to me.

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:59.404
See, like many of you,

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:01.978
growing up, I was an honor roll student,

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.321
a scholarship student,

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.925
with dreams of becoming a doctor.

00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.556
But things went dramatically wrong

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:10.730
when my parents separated

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.567
and eventually divorced.

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.417
The actual events are pretty straightforward.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:19.865
At the age of 17,

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.510
I got shot three times

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.135
standing on the corner of my block in Detroit.

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.830
My friend rushed me to the hospital.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.054
Doctors pulled the bullets out,

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.845
patched me up,

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:38.216
and sent me back to the same 
neighborhood where I got shot.

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:40.971
Throughout this ordeal,

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.031
no one hugged me,

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.401
no one counseled me,

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:48.341
no one told me I would be okay.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.265
No one told me that I would live in fear,

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:53.878
that I would become paranoid,

00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:56.871
or that I would react hyper-violently

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.249
to being shot.

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.070
No one told me that one day,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.127
I would become the person behind the trigger.

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:08.801
Fourteen months later,

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:11.411
at 2 a.m.,

00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:13.047
I fired the shots

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:16.900
that caused a man's death.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.810
When I entered prison,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.317
I was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.

00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:27.287
I didn't want to take responsibility.

00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:29.339
I blamed everybody from my parents

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.312
to the system.

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.524
I rationalized my decision to shoot

00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:36.963
because in the hood where I come from,

00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:38.589
it's better to be the shooter

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.901
than the person getting shot.

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:45.223
As I sat in my cold cell,

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:46.870
I felt helpless,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.257
unloved and abandoned.

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:54.135
I felt like nobody cared,

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:56.154
and I reacted

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:59.165
with hostility to my confinement.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:00.303
And I found myself getting

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:02.618
deeper and deeper into trouble.

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:05.398
I ran black market stores,

00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:08.117
I loan sharked,

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:10.183
and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled

00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:12.044
into the prison.

00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:13.614
I had in fact become

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:16.295
what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:19.132
"the worst of the worst."

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.457
And because of my activity,

00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:24.149
I landed in solitary confinement

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.578
for seven and a half years

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:29.790
out of my incarceration.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.459
Now as I see it, solitary confinement

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.399
is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.298
you can find yourself,

00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:39.189
but find myself I did.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.700
One day, I was pacing my cell,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.217
when an officer came and delivered mail.

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:48.954
I looked at a couple of letters

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:50.868
before I looked at the letter

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.930
that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.367
And anytime I would get a letter from my son,

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.272
it was like a ray of light

00:03:57.272 --> 00:04:00.029
in the darkest place you can imagine.

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:03.844
And on this particular day, I opened this letter,

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.950
and in capital letters, he wrote,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.205
"My mama told me why you was in prison:

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:12.899
murder."

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:14.818
He said, "Dad, don't kill.

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:20.265
Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him."

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:22.100
Now, I wasn't religious at that time,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.807
nor am I religious now,

00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:26.291
but it was something so profound

00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.053
about my son's words.

00:04:29.063 --> 00:04:30.685
They made me examine things about my life

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:32.621
that I hadn't considered.

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:34.557
It was the first time in my life

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.529
that I had actually thought about the fact

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.195
that my son would see me as a murderer.

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:42.249
I sat back on my bunk

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.268
and I reflected on something I had read

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.865
in [Plato],

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:48.840
where Socrates stated in "Apology"

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.111
that the unexamined life isn't worth living.

00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:58.943
At that point is when the transformation began.

00:04:58.943 --> 00:05:01.863
But it didn't come easy.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.764
One of the things I realized,

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.921
which was part of the transformation,

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:11.663
was that there were four key things.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:13.970
The first thing was,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.283
I had great mentors.

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:18.159
Now, I know some of you all are probably thinking,

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.328
how did you find a great mentor in prison?

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:24.193
But in my case,

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:25.423
some of my mentors

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:27.300
who are serving life sentences

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.009
were some of the best people
to ever come into my life,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.273
because they forced me to look at my life honestly,

00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:35.098
and they forced me to challenge myself

00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:37.613
about my decision making.

00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:41.867
The second thing was literature.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.610
Prior to going to prison,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.607
I didn't know that there were so many brilliant

00:05:45.607 --> 00:05:48.888
black poets, authors and philosophers,

00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:51.907
and then I had the great fortune

00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:56.074
of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,

00:05:56.074 --> 00:06:00.621
and it shattered every
stereotype I had about myself.

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.062
The third thing was family.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:07.738
For 19 years, my father stood by my side

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:10.167
with an unshakable faith,

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:11.831
because he believed that I had what it took

00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:14.125
to turn my life around.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:17.018
I also met an amazing woman

00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:20.452
who is now the mother of
my two-year-old son Sekou,

00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:22.680
and she taught me how to love myself

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.958
in a healthy way.

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.654
The final thing was writing.

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:31.068
When I got that letter from my son,

00:06:31.068 --> 00:06:33.278
I began to write a journal

00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:36.079
about things I had experienced in my childhood

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.872
and in prison,

00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:42.138
and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea

00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:45.106
of atonement.

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:47.188
Earlier in my incarceration, I had received

00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:50.995
a letter from one of the relatives of my victim,

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:53.840
and in that letter,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.685
she told me she forgave me,

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:57.634
because she realized I was a young child

00:06:57.634 --> 00:06:58.971
who had been abused

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.763
and had been through some hardships

00:07:00.763 --> 00:07:03.501
and just made a series of poor decisions.

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.972
It was the first time in my life

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:13.701
that I ever felt open to forgiving myself.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.945
One of the things that happened

00:07:14.945 --> 00:07:17.268
after that experience is that

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:19.156
I thought about the other men who were incarcerated

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.968
alongside of me,

00:07:20.968 --> 00:07:23.890
and how much I wanted to share this with them.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.644
And so I started talking to them about

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:27.571
some of their experiences,

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:29.053
and I was devastated to realize

00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:32.431
that most of them came from
the same abusive environments,

00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:35.970
And most of them wanted help
and they wanted to turn it around,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.710
but unfortunately the system

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.928
that currently holds 2.5 million people in prison

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.128
is designed to warehouse

00:07:43.128 --> 00:07:47.420
as opposed to rehabilitate or transform.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.311
So I made it up in my mind

00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.065
that if I was ever released from prison

00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:53.522
that I would do everything in my power

00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:57.223
to help change that.

00:07:57.223 --> 00:07:59.989
In 2010, I walked out of prison

00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:03.067
for the first time after two decades.

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:04.655
Now imagine, if you will,

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:07.237
Fred Flintstone walking into an episode

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.620
of "The Jetsons."

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.555
That was pretty much what my life was like.

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:15.870
For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.606
social media,

00:08:17.606 --> 00:08:21.743
cars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider."

00:08:21.743 --> 00:08:23.527
But the thing that fascinated me the most

00:08:23.527 --> 00:08:25.310
was phone technology.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.582
See, when I went to prison,

00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:28.357
our car phones were this big

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:30.958
and required two people to carry them.

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.046
So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.172
my little Blackberry

00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:37.123
and I started learning how to text.

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:38.790
But the thing is, the people around me,

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.386
they didn't realize that I had no idea

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.080
what all these abbreviated texts meant,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.110
like LOL, OMG, LMAO,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.852
until one day I was having a conversation

00:08:49.852 --> 00:08:52.108
with one of my friends via text,

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:56.139
and I asked him to do something,
and he responded back, "K."

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:59.318
And I was like, "What is K?"

00:08:59.318 --> 00:09:01.280
And he was like, "K is okay."

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.279
So in my head, I was like,

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.297
"Well what the hell is wrong with K?"

00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:07.810
And so I text him a question mark.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.481
And he said, "K = okay."

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:16.170
And so I tap back, "FU." (Laughter)

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.926
And then he texts back, and he asks me

00:09:17.926 --> 00:09:19.600
why was I cussing him out.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.260
And I said, "LOL FU,"

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.959
as in, I finally understand.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.996
(Laughter)

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:29.261
And so fast forward three years,

00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:31.135
I'm doing relatively good.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:33.813
I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:37.030
I work for an amazing company called BMe,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.360
I teach at the University of Michigan,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.337
but it's been a struggle

00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:42.800
because I realize that there are more

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.435
men and women coming home

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:47.596
who are not going to be
afforded those opportunities.

00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:49.401
I've been blessed to work with some amazing

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.085
men and women,

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:53.847
helping others reenter society,

00:09:53.847 --> 00:09:58.060
and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.015
He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:04.783
He's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.

00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:06.507
And one of the things that we talked about

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:08.219
is the three things that I found important

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:09.839
in my personal transformation,

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.778
the first being acknowledgment.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.204
I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.

00:10:14.204 --> 00:10:17.000
I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.421
The second thing was apologizing.

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:21.571
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt.

00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:23.643
Even though I had no expectations
of them accepting it,

00:10:23.643 --> 00:10:26.395
it was important to do because it was the right thing.

00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:29.354
But I also had to apologize to myself.

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:32.171
The third thing was atoning.

00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:33.854
For me, atoning meant

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:35.447
going back into my community

00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:36.990
and working with at-risk youth

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.790
who were on the same path,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.530
but also becoming at one with myself.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.294
Through my experience of being locked up,

00:10:44.294 --> 00:10:46.475
one of the things I discovered is this:

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:47.691
the majority of men and women

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:51.112
who are incarcerated are redeemable,

00:10:51.112 --> 00:10:52.372
and the fact is,

00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:54.723
90 percent of the men and
women who are incarcerated

00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:57.411
will at some point return to the community,

00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.326
and we have a role in determining what kind

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:02.945
of men and women return to our community.

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.556
My wish today

00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:09.209
is that we will embrace

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:11.358
a more empathetic approach

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:14.578
toward how we deal with mass incarceration,

00:11:14.578 --> 00:11:15.722
that we will do away with

00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:18.037
the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,

00:11:18.037 --> 00:11:21.960
because it's proven it doesn't work.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.413
My journey is a unique journey,

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:27.078
but it doesn't have to be that way.

00:11:27.078 --> 00:11:29.484
Anybody can have a transformation

00:11:29.484 --> 00:11:32.324
if we create the space for that to happen.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:34.086
So what I'm asking today

00:11:34.086 --> 00:11:35.793
is that you envision

00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:38.133
a world where men and women

00:11:38.133 --> 00:11:41.829
aren't held hostage to their pasts,

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:43.262
where misdeeds and mistakes

00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:46.030
don't define you for the rest of your life.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.221
I think collectively, we can create that reality,

00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:50.924
and I hope you do too.

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:52.690
Thank you.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.773
(Applause)
