00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.983
I once had this nightmare:

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.908
I'm standing in the middle
of a deserted field full of land mines.

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.036
In real life, I love to hike,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.729
but every time I want to go on a hike,
it makes me nervous.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:28.851
I have this thought in the back of my mind

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.389
that I might lose a limb.

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.101
This underlying fear started 10 years ago,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.423
after I met Mohammed,
a cluster bomb survivor

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:41.383
of the summer 2006
Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:45.557
Mohammed, like so many
other survivors all around the world,

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:50.568
had to live through the horrifying
repercussions of cluster munitions

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.184
on a daily basis.

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:55.761
When the one-month conflict
started in Lebanon,

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.098
I was still working
at Agence France-Presse in Paris.

00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:02.439
I remember how I was glued to the screens,

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:04.648
anxiously following the news.

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:06.838
I wanted to reassure myself

00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:09.741
that the falling bombs
missed my parents' home.

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:14.311
When I arrived in Beirut
on assignment to cover that war,

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:16.803
I was relieved to be united
with my family,

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.950
after they had finally managed
to escape southern Lebanon.

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:22.543
The day the war was over,

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.718
I remember seeing this image --

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:26.185
one of blocked roads,

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.338
of displaced people eagerly rushing
south, back to their homes,

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.457
regardless of what they would find.

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:36.444
An estimated four million
cluster submunitions

00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:40.104
were spread in Lebanon during
the 34-day conflict.

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:46.001
Mohammed lost both legs
during the last week of the conflict.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:49.877
The fact that he lives a five-minute
drive from my parents' home

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.656
made it easier to follow
him through the years.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.660
It was now almost 10 years
since we first met.

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:57.860
I saw the young boy

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:01.764
who had to endure
physical and emotional trauma.

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:05.609
I saw the teenager who tried
to offer his friends tattoos,

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.186
in return for a set fee of five dollars.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.313
And I know the young, jobless man
who spends hours surfing the Internet

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:16.430
trying to meet a girl who might
become his girlfriend.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.922
His fate and the effects
of losing his legs

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:22.943
are now his daily reality.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:25.967
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.444
have to deal with so many details
that never occur to us.

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:30.993
Who would have imagined

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.752
that so many daily tasks we do
or take for granted,

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:38.029
such as going to the beach or even
picking up something from the floor,

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:41.077
would become sources
of stress and anxiety?

00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:44.197
Well, that's what eventually
became of Mohammed,

00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:46.963
due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:52.135
Ten years ago, I had no clue
what a cluster bomb was,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.447
nor its horrifying implications.

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:57.272
I learned that this indiscriminate
weapon was used

00:02:57.296 --> 00:02:58.811
in so many parts of the world

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:01.107
and continues to kill on a regular basis,

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:04.170
without distinguishing
between a military target

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:05.366
or a child.

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:07.982
I naively asked myself,

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.385
"But seriously, who made those weapons?

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:13.200
And what for?"

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:16.155
Let me explain to you
what a cluster bomb is.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.353
It's a large canister
filled with bomblets.

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.040
When it's dropped from the air,

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:25.164
it opens up in midair to release
hundreds of bomblets.

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:27.750
They scatter around wide areas

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:28.927
and on impact,

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:30.634
many fail to explode.

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:34.569
Those unexploded ones end up
just like landmines --

00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:35.826
sitting on the ground,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.821
waiting for their next target.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.014
If someone steps on them by accident

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:42.196
or picks them up,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.678
they can explode.

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:47.166
These weapons are extremely unpredictable,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.219
which makes the threat even bigger.

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:52.342
One day, a farmer can work
his land without a problem.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:56.321
The next day, he can make fire
and burn some branches,

00:03:56.345 --> 00:04:00.135
and the submunitions close by
could be set off because of the heat.

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:04.311
The problem is children mistake
those bomblets for toys,

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:07.686
because they can look like
bouncy balls or soda cans.

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.809
Being a documentary photographer,

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:14.972
I decided to go back to Lebanon
a few months after the conflict ended

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:16.969
to meet cluster bomb survivors.

00:04:16.993 --> 00:04:18.144
And I met a few --

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:19.741
Hussein and Rasha,

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.766
who both lost a leg to submunitions.

00:04:22.143 --> 00:04:26.359
Their stories are similar to so many
other kids' stories across the world

00:04:26.383 --> 00:04:29.432
and are a testimony
to the horrifying implications

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:32.286
of the continuous use of such weapons.

00:04:33.332 --> 00:04:36.917
That's when I met Mohammed,
in January 2007.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:38.707
He was 11 years old,

00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:42.245
and I met him exactly four months
after his accident.

00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:43.928
When I first saw him,

00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:46.071
he was going through painful physiotherapy

00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:48.071
to recover from his fresh wounds.

00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:50.819
Still in shock at such a young age,

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:54.337
Mohammed was struggling
to get used to his new body.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.960
He would even wake up sometimes
at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.

00:05:00.187 --> 00:05:03.876
What drew me closer to his story
was my instant realization

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.466
of the difficulties Mohammed
was likely to face in the future --

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:11.322
that what he has been suffering
while adjusting to his injury

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:13.016
at the age of 11,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.656
would increase manyfold.

00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:17.361
Even before his disability,

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.602
Mohammed's life wasn't easy.

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:22.906
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp
for Palestinian refugees,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.079
and this is where he still lives.

00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:28.825
Lebanon holds some 400,000
Palestinian refugees,

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.147
and they suffer from discriminatory laws.

00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:34.235
They're not allowed to work
in the public sector

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.242
or practice certain professions

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:39.254
and are denied the right to own property.

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:40.533
This is one of the reasons

00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:43.300
why Mohammed doesn't really
regret dropping out of school

00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:44.996
right after his injury.

00:05:45.397 --> 00:05:48.936
He said, "What's the point
of a university degree

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.123
when I can't find a job to start with?"

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:57.260
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle
of impact on communities,

00:05:57.284 --> 00:05:59.969
and not only the lives of their victims.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:03.808
Many who get injured by this weapon
drop out of school,

00:06:03.832 --> 00:06:06.269
can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:09.490
therefore losing the ability
to provide for their families.

00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:13.214
This is not to mention
the continuous physical pain

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:16.343
and the experience of feeling isolated.

00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:20.600
These weapons affect
the poorest of the poor.

00:06:20.624 --> 00:06:23.503
The high medical cost
is a burden to the families.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:26.931
They end up relying
on humanitarian agencies,

00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:29.484
which is insufficient and unsustainable,

00:06:29.508 --> 00:06:33.150
especially when injuries require
lifelong support to the injured.

00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:35.542
Ten years after Mohammed's injury,

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:39.285
he is still unable to afford
proper prosthetic legs.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.661
He's very cautious with his steps,

00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:43.703
as a couple of falls over the years

00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:46.147
brought him embarrassment
among his friends.

00:06:47.218 --> 00:06:49.297
He joked that since he doesn't have legs,

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.977
some days he tries to walk on his hands.

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:56.412
One of the worst yet invisible
impacts of the weapon

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.988
is the psychological scars it leaves.

00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:01.664
In one of Mohammed's
early medical reports,

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:04.731
he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:09.987
He suffered from anxiety,
poor appetite, sleep disturbance

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.422
and showed signs of anger.

00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:17.811
The reality is Mohammed never received
proper help to fully recover.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.487
His current obsession
is to leave Lebanon at any cost --

00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:25.376
even if it meant embarking
on a hazardous journey

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.979
along with refugees drifting towards
Europe today through the Mediterranean.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.295
Knowing how risky such a journey would be,

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.439
he said, "If I were to die on the way,

00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:37.723
it doesn't matter."

00:07:37.747 --> 00:07:40.863
To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:45.302
Cluster bombs are a world problem,

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:49.987
as this munition keeps destroying
and hurting whole communities

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.714
for generations to come.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:56.132
In an online interview with the director
of the Mines Advisory Group,

00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:57.307
Jamie Franklin,

00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:58.487
he said,

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:03.063
"The US forces dropped over two million
tons of munitions over Laos.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.255
If they couldn't find
their targets in Vietnam,

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:10.576
there were free-drop areas in Laos
where planes would drop their loads

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.595
before going back to base,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.656
because it's dangerous to land
with loaded planes."

00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:19.415
According to the International
Committee of the Red Cross,

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:22.795
in Laos alone -- one of the poorest
countries in the world --

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:27.632
nine to 27 million unexploded
submunitions remain.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:33.171
Some 11,000 people have been killed
or injured since 1973.

00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:39.579
This lethal weapon has been used
by over 20 states during armed conflicts

00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:41.761
in over 35 countries,

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:45.213
such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:50.689
So far, 119 states have joined
an international treaty

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.424
banning cluster bombs,

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:55.487
which is officially called
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:59.867
But some of the biggest producers
of cluster munitions --

00:08:59.891 --> 00:09:03.230
namely, the United States,
Russia and China --

00:09:03.254 --> 00:09:05.724
remain outside of this lifesaving treaty

00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:07.685
and continue to produce them,

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:10.528
reserve the right to produce
them in the future,

00:09:10.552 --> 00:09:13.278
keep those harmful weapons
in their stockpiles

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.490
and even possibly use them in the future.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.712
Cluster bombs have reportedly
been used most recently

00:09:21.736 --> 00:09:25.123
in the ongoing conflicts
in Yemen and Syria.

00:09:26.122 --> 00:09:28.885
According to research
on the worldwide investments

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:30.535
in cluster munitions producers

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:32.642
by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.256
financial institutions invested
billions of US dollars

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.063
into companies that make
cluster munitions.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.508
The majority of these institutions
are based in countries

00:09:44.532 --> 00:09:48.053
that have not yet signed
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

00:09:49.114 --> 00:09:51.141
Getting back to Mohammed,

00:09:51.165 --> 00:09:54.815
one of the few jobs he was able
to find was picking lemons.

00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:59.067
When I ask him if it's safe
to work in the field he said,

00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:00.300
"I'm not sure."

00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:05.691
Research shows that cluster munitions
often contaminate areas

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:08.957
where agriculture is the main
source of income.

00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:12.890
According to Handicap
International's research,

00:10:12.914 --> 00:10:18.892
98 percent of those killed or injured
by cluster munitions are civilians.

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:22.689
Eighty-four percent
of casualties are males.

00:10:23.074 --> 00:10:25.807
In countries where
these people have no choice

00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.887
but to work in those fields,

00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:29.567
they simply do it

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:30.823
and risk it.

00:10:31.914 --> 00:10:34.982
Mohammed is the only male
to three sisters.

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:38.332
Culturally, he's expected
to provide for his family,

00:10:38.356 --> 00:10:39.765
but he simply can't.

00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:42.201
He tried to have so many different jobs,

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.791
but he couldn't keep any
due to his physical disability

00:10:45.815 --> 00:10:49.280
and the less-than-friendly environment
to people with disabilities,

00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:50.525
to say the least.

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:54.911
It hurts him a lot when he goes
out looking for a job,

00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:56.128
and he's turned away

00:10:56.152 --> 00:10:58.817
with a small amount of money
paid to him out of pity.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.381
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money,

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.113
I just want to earn it."

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:08.182
Mohammed today is 21 years old.

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:09.404
He's illiterate,

00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:12.497
and he communicates with voice messages.

00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:14.274
Here is one of his messages.

00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:20.209
(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)

00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:25.900
Laura Boushnak:
He said, "My dream is to run,

00:11:25.924 --> 00:11:28.101
and I'm pretty sure once I start running,

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.635
I would never stop."

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:30.842
Thank you.

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:35.690
(Applause)
