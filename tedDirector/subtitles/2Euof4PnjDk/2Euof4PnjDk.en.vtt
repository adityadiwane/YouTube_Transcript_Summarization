00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:19.000
Interpreter: Piano, "p,"
is my favorite musical symbol.

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:21.293
It means to play softly.

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.170
If you're playing a musical instrument
and you notice a "p" in the score,

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:27.817
you need to play softer.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.480
Two p's -- even softer.

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:33.959
Four p's -- extremely soft.

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:41.756
This is my drawing of a p-tree,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.090
which demonstrates

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:47.603
no matter how many thousands
upon thousands of p's there may be,

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.560
you'll never reach complete silence.

00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:53.255
That's my current definition of silence:

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:55.128
a very obscure sound.

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:58.459
I'd like to share a little bit

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:01.649
about the history
of American Sign Language, ASL,

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:03.361
plus a bit of my own background.

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:11.067
French sign language was brought
to America during the early 1800s,

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.166
and as time went by,
mixed with local signs,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.519
it evolved into the language
we know today as ASL.

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:21.765
So it has a history of about 200 years.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.508
I was born deaf,

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:30.779
and I was taught to believe
that sound wasn't a part of my life.

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.497
And I believed it to be true.

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:40.841
Yet, I realize now
that that wasn't the case at all.

00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:44.057
Sound was very much a part of my life,

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:45.957
really, on my mind every day.

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:54.470
As a Deaf person living
in a world of sound,

00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:57.414
it's as if I was living
in a foreign country,

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:01.680
blindly following its rules,
customs, behaviors and norms

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.315
without ever questioning them.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.930
So how is it that I understand sound?

00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:21.226
Well, I watch how people
behave and respond to sound.

00:02:22.654 --> 00:02:26.276
You people are like my loudspeakers,
and amplify sound.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.421
I learn and mirror that behavior.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.733
At the same time,
I've learned that I create sound,

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:33.914
and I've seen how people respond to me.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.456
Thus I've learned, for example ...

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.119
"Don't slam the door!"

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.747
"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.771
(Laughter)

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:46.063
"Don't burp,

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:47.268
and when you're eating,

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.134
make sure you don't scrape
your utensils on the plate."

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:52.688
All of these things
I term "sound etiquette."

00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:58.358
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:00.596
more than the average hearing person does.

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:03.919
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:11.329
And I'm always waiting
in eager nervous anticipation

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:13.435
around sound, about what's to come next.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.743
Hence, this drawing.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.894
TBD, to be decided.

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:22.264
TBC, to be continued.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.616
TBA, to be announced.

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:30.659
And you notice the staff --

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:32.874
there are no notes contained in the lines.

00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:36.546
That's because the lines
already contain sound

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.901
through the subtle smudges and smears.

00:03:40.863 --> 00:03:44.242
In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:52.301
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:54.817
A typical staff contains five lines.

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.678
Yet for me, signing it
with my thumb sticking up like that

00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.029
doesn't feel natural.

00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:03.461
That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
I stick to four lines on paper.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.188
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
to travel to Berlin, Germany,

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:10.981
for an artist residency there.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.819
Prior to this time,
I had been working as a painter.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.075
During this summer, I visited
different museums and gallery spaces,

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.081
and as I went from one place to the next,

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.424
I noticed there was no visual art there.

00:04:26.618 --> 00:04:31.885
At that time, sound was trending,
and this struck me ...

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.887
there was no visual art,

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.418
everything was auditory.

00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:40.122
Now sound has come into my art territory.

00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:43.816
Is it going to further
distance me from art?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.496
I realized that doesn't
have to be the case at all.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.671
I actually know sound.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:52.337
I know it so well

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.699
that it doesn't have to be something
just experienced through the ears.

00:04:55.723 --> 00:04:58.708
It could be felt tactually,

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.615
or experienced as a visual,

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.313
or even as an idea.

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:08.309
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:10.447
and to put it into my art practice.

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:16.595
And everything that I had been
taught regarding sound,

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.353
I decided to do away with and unlearn.

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.389
I started creating a new body of work.

00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:27.515
And when I presented this
to the art community,

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.435
I was blown away with the amount
of support and attention I received.

00:05:32.676 --> 00:05:34.042
I realized:

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.155
sound is like money,

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:42.351
power, control --

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.919
social currency.

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:51.646
In the back of my mind, I've always felt
that sound was your thing,

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.157
a hearing person's thing.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:58.489
And sound is so powerful

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:02.269
that it could either
disempower me and my artwork,

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:04.301
or it could empower me.

00:06:05.138 --> 00:06:06.675
I chose to be empowered.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.317
There's a massive culture
around spoken language.

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:18.500
And just because I don't use
my literal voice to communicate,

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:22.276
in society's eyes
it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:28.863
So I need to work with individuals
who can support me as an equal

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:30.359
and become my voice.

00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:36.765
And that way, I'm able to maintain
relevancy in society today.

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.211
So at school, at work and institutions,

00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:41.559
I work with many
different ASL interpreters.

00:06:43.254 --> 00:06:46.453
And their voice becomes
my voice and identity.

00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:50.070
They help me to be heard.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.543
And their voices hold value and currency.

00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:06.516
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.361
I'm able to maintain
a temporary form of currency,

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:13.367
kind of like taking out a loan
with a very high interest rate.

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:20.149
If I didn't continue this practice,

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:23.006
I feel that I could just
fade off into oblivion

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.397
and not maintain
any form of social currency.

00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:32.143
So with sound as my new art medium,

00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:33.901
I delved into the world of music.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.065
And I was surprised to see
the similarities between music and ASL.

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:42.703
For example,

00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:45.079
a musical note

00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:48.126
cannot be fully captured
and expressed on paper.

00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:51.835
And the same holds true
for a concept in ASL.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.624
They're both highly spatial
and highly inflected --

00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:04.370
meaning that subtle changes

00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:06.903
can affect the entire meaning

00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:08.711
of both signs and sounds.

00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:14.120
I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,

00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:17.129
to have you have a better
understanding of how ASL works.

00:08:17.153 --> 00:08:18.711
So, envision a piano.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.654
ASL is broken down into
many different grammatical parameters.

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:28.831
If you assign a different parameter
to each finger as you play the piano --

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:33.860
such as facial expression, body movement,

00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:37.656
speed, hand shape and so on,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.888
as you play the piano --

00:08:39.912 --> 00:08:41.749
English is a linear language,

00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:44.578
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:48.250
However, ASL is more like a chord --

00:08:48.274 --> 00:08:51.658
all 10 fingers need
to come down simultaneously

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:55.304
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

00:08:57.548 --> 00:09:01.574
If just one of those keys
were to change the chord,

00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:03.791
it would create a completely
different meaning.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:08.426
The same applies to music
in regards to pitch, tone and volume.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:16.096
In ASL, by playing around with these
different grammatical parameters,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.813
you can express different ideas.

00:09:17.837 --> 00:09:19.822
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.948
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:25.950
I'm looking at you.

00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:29.356
Staring at you.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.094
(Laughter)

00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:34.400
(Laughter)

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:38.399
Oh -- busted.

00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:39.573
(Laughter)

00:09:41.608 --> 00:09:42.779
Uh-oh.

00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:46.935
What are you looking at?

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.738
Aw, stop.

00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:52.431
(Laughter)

00:09:52.455 --> 00:09:53.639
I then started thinking,

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:56.580
"What if I was to look at ASL
through a musical lens?"

00:09:57.011 --> 00:10:00.218
If I was to create a sign
and repeat it over and over,

00:10:00.242 --> 00:10:02.631
it could become
like a piece of visual music.

00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:07.652
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:09.848
as the sun rises and sets.

00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:14.129
This is "all day."

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:19.617
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:21.806
visually it looks like a piece of music.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:26.482
All ... day.

00:10:27.186 --> 00:10:31.084
I feel the same holds true
for "all night."

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:34.930
"All night."

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.125
This is ALL-NIGHT,
represented in this drawing.

00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:45.714
And this led me to thinking
about three different kinds of nights:

00:10:49.827 --> 00:10:50.977
"last night,"

00:10:52.747 --> 00:10:53.899
"overnight,"

00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.303
(Sings) "all night long."

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.588
(Laughter)

00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.206
I feel like the third one has
a lot more musicality than the other two.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.381
(Laughter)

00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:16.448
This represents how time
is expressed in ASL

00:11:16.472 --> 00:11:20.931
and how the distance from your body
can express the changes in time.

00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:22.594
For example,

00:11:22.618 --> 00:11:25.757
1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,

00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:29.011
present tense happens closest
and in front of the body,

00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:32.472
future is in front of the body
and the past is to your back.

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:39.040
So, the first example
is "a long time ago."

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:41.370
Then "past,"

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.231
"used to"

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:48.290
and the last one, which is my favorite,

00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:50.940
with the very romantic
and dramatic notion to it,

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:52.553
"once upon a time."

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.986
(Laughter)

00:11:57.962 --> 00:12:00.679
"Common time"

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:02.471
is a musical term

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:06.478
with a specific time signature
of four beats per measure.

00:12:07.614 --> 00:12:09.426
Yet when I see the word "common time,"

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.606
what automatically comes to mind for me
is "at the same time."

00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.856
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:20.197
We have the staff
across the head and the chest.

00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:21.403
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:22.677
[Common time]

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.234
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:28.810
I'm now going to demonstrate
a hand shape called the "flash claw."

00:12:30.722 --> 00:12:32.699
Can you please follow along with me?

00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:35.067
Everybody, hands up.

00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:41.474
Now we're going to do it
in both the head and the chest,

00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:43.872
kind of like "common time"
or at the same time.

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:48.896
Yes, got it.

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:52.144
That means "to fall in love"
in International [Sign].

00:12:52.168 --> 00:12:54.045
(Laughter)

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:55.972
International [Sign], as a note,

00:12:55.996 --> 00:12:58.741
is a visual tool to help communicate

00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:01.466
across cultures and sign languages
around the world.

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:04.283
The second one I'd like
to demonstrate is this --

00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:06.043
please follow along with me again.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.041
And now this.

00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:20.058
This is "colonization" in ASL.

00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:21.486
(Laughter)

00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:24.678
Now the third --

00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:26.096
please follow along again.

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:32.222
And again.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.478
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:41.063
So let's do all three together.

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:44.889
"Fall in love,"

00:13:45.897 --> 00:13:47.066
"colonization"

00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:48.995
and "enlightenment."

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:51.917
Good job, everyone.

00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:53.159
(Laughter)

00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:55.421
Notice how all three signs
are very similar,

00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:57.542
they all happen at the head and the chest,

00:13:57.566 --> 00:13:59.788
but they convey quite different meanings.

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:03.136
So it's amazing to see
how ASL is alive and thriving,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.459
just like music is.

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:08.978
However, in this day and age,

00:14:09.002 --> 00:14:11.604
we live in a very audio-centric world.

00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:15.009
And just because ASL has no sound to it,

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:17.943
it automatically holds no social currency.

00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:24.009
We need to start thinking harder
about what defines social currency

00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:27.875
and allow ASL to develop
its own form of currency --

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:29.064
without sound.

00:14:30.262 --> 00:14:34.950
And this could possibly be a step
to lead to a more inclusive society.

00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:40.423
And maybe people will understand

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:43.983
that you don't need
to be deaf to learn ASL,

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:46.294
nor do you have to be hearing
to learn music.

00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:51.586
ASL is such a rich treasure

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.395
that I'd like you
to have the same experience.

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:57.195
And I'd like to invite you
to open your ears,

00:14:57.219 --> 00:14:59.110
to open your eyes,

00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:00.845
take part in our culture

00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:03.388
and experience our visual language.

00:15:03.412 --> 00:15:04.847
And you never know,

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:06.611
you might just fall in love with us.

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:08.693
(Applause)

00:15:08.717 --> 00:15:09.879
Thank you.

00:15:10.508 --> 00:15:12.409
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:15.831
(Applause)
