00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
the problems and the opportunities that we face,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.160
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Now, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
(Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Because, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
through the waste products of his civilization.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
Due to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide --

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
which helps air absorb heat from the sun --

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
This is bad?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
melt the polar ice caps.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
through 150 feet of tropical water.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
Larry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.160
that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
Well, it depends, really, on what your goals are.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160
"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.160
or the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.160
most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.160
and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it."

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
who are the poorest and the most vulnerable,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.160
the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
But there's also a wonderful case for optimism.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Let's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.160
There's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.160
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160
as will the increasing rise of population.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.160
and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
we eat as if we were 20 billion.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:04.160
And we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
the poorest and the most vulnerable.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
That's why they migrate to cities.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.160
That's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
and bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
The green revolution never reached Africa.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
In Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.160
and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.160
that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.160
but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.160
-- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:54.160
to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
And in fact, with increasing globalization --

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.160
for which there are big winners and even bigger losers

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.160
-- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.160
One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.160
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160
rise to three billion in the next 30 years?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
and services. Not because they've grown richer,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.160
but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Last week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.160
"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
So there's lots of reason for pessimism.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Darfur is, at its origin, a resource war.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.160
230 a day, that required police or military intervention.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
Most of them were about resources.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.160
We are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Some are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.160
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:39.160
a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.160
And unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160
you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
What will that lead to?

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:57.160
For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:06.160
For others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160
For us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:20.160
As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.160
Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.160
First, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
global warming would continue.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:46.160
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.160
the next decades will see rising sea levels.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:58.160
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
What will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.160
So here's Bangladesh.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.160
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.160
And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.160
the deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.160
because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Now we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Many of you, I think, have probably trekked here.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.160
coming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.160
And now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:17.160
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:26.160
coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:35.160
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
into India and into China.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.160
This is the difficulty that one country faces.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:52.160
But if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
populated areas near the water,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:06.160
Sub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
We're all in this together.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.160
names that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.160
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
we live in each other's viral environment.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Do you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
and it marched every year, westwardly.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
It's just the beginning, unfortunately.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:04.160
There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:11.160
that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
It's more than enough reason for pessimism.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.160
But now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter)

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.160
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.160
We've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.160
when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
which fought against the nuclear threat,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Medicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Mohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
brought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
We've seen the eradication of smallpox.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
We may see the eradication of polio this year.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.160
Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year --

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
there are only 35,000 cases left in the world.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
20 years ago, there were three and a half million.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.160
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter)

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
It's an amazing phenomenon.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.160
All throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
disease of sudden wealth syndrome.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.160
But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
They're not waiting until they die to create foundations.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160
They're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
to make the world a better place.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
More reasons to be optimistic:

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.160
in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
We all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.160
that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.160
Today, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
It's just beginning.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Five weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:47.160
to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160
that would have contributed to destroying the environment.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Six months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
Republican governor in California to pass AB 32,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:16.160
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
Can you imagine? (Laughter)

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.160
We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
I would not have believed, as the evangelical community

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.160
has understood the desperate situation of global warming.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.160
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.160
It is something to be greatly optimistic about.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.160
The European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.160
something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
And on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.160
individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.160
against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160
And on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
there will be global Live Earth concerts.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.160
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
hurts the poorest and the weakest the most.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
That means that people are beginning the first step,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
which is acting out of their own self-interest.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.160
so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
to work not just on primary prevention of global warming,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.160
but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.160
on the poorest and the most vulnerable.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
But for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.160
And you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
that I thought I would share a little bit of mine.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.160
My background is not exactly conventional medical training.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.160
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.160
who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny --

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:41.160
it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
and to help eradicate smallpox,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.160
at a time when there was no smallpox program.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.160
because it was the worst disease in history.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.160
In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago --

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
half a billion people died from smallpox:

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
more than all the wars in history,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:18.160
In the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
It's not ancient history.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.160
When you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:33.160
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:39.160
To eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:45.160
We visited every house in India, searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.160
once every month, for nearly two years.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
In a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox --

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.160
and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.160
When we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.160
because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.160
who could come there and get employment.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160
and they went home to die.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160
And when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
and reignited the epidemic.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.160
And we had to start all over again.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:33.160
But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.160
this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh --

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:47.160
when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:53.160
and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:01.160
thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:07.160
How can that not make you optimistic?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.160
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.160
all of those who were made blind in India, ended.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:25.160
And most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.160
of every race, every religion, every color, worked together,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160
fought alongside each other,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.160
fought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160
Thank you very much.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.160
(Applause)
