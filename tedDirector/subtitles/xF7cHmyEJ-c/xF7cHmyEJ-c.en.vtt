00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
the history of music and television on the Internet

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
in three minutes.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
A TED medley --

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
a TEDley.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
♫ Sell us a song, you're the music man ♫

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
♫ My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go ♫

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
♫ But Steve likes to run the whole show ♫

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
♫ I heard "Desperate Housewives" was great last night ♫

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
♫ But I had a bad piece of cod ♫

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
♫ As I threw up my meal, I thought, "It's no big deal" ♫

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
♫ I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod ♫

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
♫ And now all of the networks are joining in ♫

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
♫ Two bucks a show without ads ♫

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
♫ It's a business those guys always wanted to try ♫

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
♫ But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads ♫

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
♫ They say we're young, don't watch TV ♫

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
♫ They say the Internet is all we see ♫

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
♫ But that's not true; they've got it wrong ♫

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
♫ See, all our shows are just two minutes long ♫

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
♫ Hey ♫

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
♫ I got YouTube ♫

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
♫ I got YouTube ♫

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America --

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
the RIAA!

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
♫ Young man, you were surfin' along ♫

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod ♫

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
♫ You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
♫ You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
♫ And there'd better not be a next time ♫

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
♫ They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
♫ You're depriving the bands ♫

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
♫ You are learning to steal ♫

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
♫ You can't do whatever you feel ♫

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
♫ CD sales have dropped every year ♫

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
♫ They're not greedy, they're just quaking with fear ♫

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
♫ Yes indeedy, what if their end is near ♫

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.160
♫ And we download all our music ♫

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
♫ Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A ♫

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
♫ No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A ♫

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
♫ What a way to make friends ♫

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
♫ It's a plan that can't fail ♫

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
♫ All your customers off to jail ♫

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
♫ Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A? ♫

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
♫ What else is vexing the R-I-A-A? ♫

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
♫ Maybe humming along ♫

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫
