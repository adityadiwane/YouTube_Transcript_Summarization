00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
What is going on

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
in this baby's mind?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
most people, including psychologists,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
would have said that this baby was irrational,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
illogical, egocentric --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
or understand cause and effect.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
In the last 20 years,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
So in some ways,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
we think that this baby's thinking

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Let me give you just one example of this.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
that could be going on in his mind,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
is trying to figure out

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And maybe the hardest thing of all

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
is to figure out that what other people think and feel

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Anyone who's followed politics can testify

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
to how hard that is for some people to get.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
We wanted to know

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
if babies and young children

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
could understand this really profound thing about other people.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Now the question is: How could we ask them?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Babies, after all, can't talk,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and if you ask a three year-old

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to tell you what he thinks,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So how do we actually ask them the question?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.260
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
one bowl of raw broccoli

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
(Laughter)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
But then what Betty did

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
So half the time, she acted

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
just like a baby and any other sane person.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But half the time,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
So she'd act as if what she wanted

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
"Can you give me some?"

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
So the question is: What would the baby give her,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
what they liked or what she liked?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
just barely walking and talking,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
On the other hand,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
like they couldn't figure this out.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But then after they stared for a long time,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
they would just give her the crackers,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
what they thought everybody must like.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
have already discovered

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
this really profound fact about human nature,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
that we don't always want the same thing.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to help other people get what they wanted.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Even more remarkably though,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
this deep, profound fact about human nature

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
So children both know more and learn more

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
than we ever would have thought.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that's actually demonstrated it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
The question you might ask though is:

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Why do children learn so much?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And how is it possible for them to learn so much

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in such a short time?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
they seem pretty useless.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
because we have to put so much time and energy

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
into just keeping them alive.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
But if we turn to evolution

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
for an answer to this puzzle

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of why we spend so much time

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
taking care of useless babies,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
it turns out that there's actually an answer.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
If we look across many, many different species of animals,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
not just us primates,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but also including other mammals, birds,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
even marsupials

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
like kangaroos and wombats,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
it turns out that there's a relationship

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
between how long a childhood a species has

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and how smart and flexible they are.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
On one side

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
is a New Caledonian crow.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
are incredibly smart birds.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And this is a bird on the cover of science

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
On the other hand,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
we have our friend the domestic chicken.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
are basically as dumb as dumps.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and they're not much good at doing anything else.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Well it turns out that the babies,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
They depend on their moms

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to drop worms in their little open mouths

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
for as long as two years,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Whereas the chickens are actually mature

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
within a couple of months.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So childhood is the reason

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
why the crows end up on the cover of Science

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and the chickens end up in the soup pot.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
There's something about that long childhood

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that seems to be connected

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
to knowledge and learning.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Well some animals, like the chicken,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
seem to be beautifully suited

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
to doing just one thing very well.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
So they seem to be beautifully suited

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to pecking grain in one environment.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Other creatures, like the crows,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
but they're extremely good

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
at learning about laws of different environments.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And of course, we human beings

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
by far than any other animal.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
We're smarter, we're more flexible,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
we can learn more,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
we survive in more different environments,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And our babies and children are dependent on us

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
for much longer than the babies of any other species.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
My son is 23.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
(Laughter)

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And at least until they're 23,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
we're still popping those worms

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
into those little open mouths.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
All right, why would we see this correlation?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
but it has one big disadvantage.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And that one big disadvantage

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
is that, until you actually do all that learning,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
you're going to be helpless.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and be saying to yourself,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
You want to know all that

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
before the mastodons actually show up.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
is with a kind of division of labor.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And then as adults,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
So one way of thinking about it

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
is that babies and young children

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
are like the research and development division of the human species.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So they're the protected blue sky guys

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and we're production and marketing.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
We have to take all those ideas

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that we learned when we were children

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and actually put them to use.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Another way of thinking about it

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
is instead of thinking of babies and children

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
as being like defective grownups,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
we should think about them

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and we're the caterpillars

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that's what they're for --

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
we might expect

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And in fact, the baby's brain

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
seems to be the most powerful learning computer

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
on the planet.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And there's been a revolution

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
in our understanding of machine learning recently.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And essentially what Bayes did

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
was to provide a mathematical way

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
using probability theory

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
to characterize, describe,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
the way that scientists find out about the world.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
So what scientists do

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
They go out and test it against the evidence.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Then they test that new hypothesis

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and so on and so forth.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And that mathematics is at the core

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And some 10 years ago,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.260
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
So if you want to know what's going on

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
underneath those beautiful brown eyes,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
I think it actually looks something like this.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
with conditional probabilities that they're revising

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
to figure out how the world works.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
they look extremely stupid.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
So to test this we used a machine that we have

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
called the Blicket Detector.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
This is a box that lights up and plays music

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
when you put some things on it and not others.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And using this very simple machine,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
my lab and others have done dozens of studies

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
showing just how good babies are

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
at learning about the world.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Let me mention just one

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
If I showed you this detector,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
you would be likely to think to begin with

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that the way to make the detector go

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
would be to put a block on top of the detector.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
But actually, this detector

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
works in a bit of a strange way.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
the detector will actually activate two out of three times.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.260
it will only activate two out of six times.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
So the unlikely hypothesis

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
actually has stronger evidence.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
It looks as if the waving

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and we just asked them to make it go.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
to wave the object on top of the detector.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
They're just learning how to count.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
But unconsciously,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
they're doing these quite complicated calculations

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
that will give them a conditional probability measure.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And the other interesting thing

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
is that they're using that evidence

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that seems very unlikely to begin with.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
we've show that four year-olds are actually better

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
So in these circumstances,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
but after all, scientists also do experiments,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
or else "playing."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
that have shown this playing around

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
is really a kind of experimental research program.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And what she did was show children

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and then she showed them an anomaly.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And what you'll see

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
in the space of two minutes.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
(Video) Boy: How about this?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Same as the other side.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
(Laughter)

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Boy: What's making this light up.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:20.260
(Laughter)

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
I don't know.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
(Laughter)

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and this needs to be like this.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Boy: That's why.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Oh.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.260
(Laughter)

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
AG: Now this is his next idea.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
He told the experimenter to do this,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.260
to try putting it out onto the other location.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
Not working either.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
not here.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Oh, the bottom of this box

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
has electricity in here,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
but this doesn't have electricity.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Boy: It's lighting up.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.260
So when you put four.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
So you put four on this one to make it light up

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
and two on this one to make it light up.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Now that is a particularly --

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
what they really do is do a series of experiments.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
a lot of them have said

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
that babies and young children were barely conscious

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
if they were conscious at all.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
And I think just the opposite is true.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And adults' attention and consciousness

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
look kind of like a spotlight.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
So what happens for adults

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
is we decide that something's relevant or important,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
we should pay attention to it.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
becomes extremely bright and vivid,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and everything else sort of goes dark.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
So what happens when we pay attention

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
sends a signal

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
more plastic, better at learning,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and shuts down activity

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
in all the rest of our brains.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.260
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
If we look at babies and young children,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
we see something very different.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I think babies and young children

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
than a spotlight of consciousness.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
So babies and young children are very bad

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
at narrowing down to just one thing.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
But they're very good at taking in lots of information

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
from lots of different sources at once.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And if you actually look in their brains,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
So when we say that babies and young children

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
are bad at paying attention,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.260
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
So they're bad at getting rid

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
of all the interesting things that could tell them something

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
and just looking at the thing that's important.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
that we might expect

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Well if we want to think about a way

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.260
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
I think the best thing is think about cases

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
when we fall in love with someone new,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
or when we're in a new city for the first time.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
it expands,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
so that those three days in Paris

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
than all the months of being

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
And by the way, that coffee,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
actually mimics the effect

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
of those baby neurotransmitters.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
So what's it like to be a baby?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
It's like being in love

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
in Paris for the first time

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
after you've had three double-espressos.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
(Laughter)

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
That's a fantastic way to be,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.260
but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
(Laughter)

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Now it's good to be a grownup.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
It's good to be a grownup.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.260
into making babies think like adults do.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
to have open-mindedness, open learning,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
imagination, creativity, innovation,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
maybe at least some of the time

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
we should be getting the adults

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
to start thinking more like children.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:23.260
(Applause)
