00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Let's talk trash.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
You know, we had to be taught

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
to renounce the powerful conservation ethic

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
toward creation of products for peacetime.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Life Magazine helped in this effort

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
by announcing the introduction of throwaways

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Mental note to the liberators:

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Plastics are also hard to recycle.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
of plastics recovered in our waste stream.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It's diddly-point-squat.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
That's the percentage we recycle.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
and does not drive off the oily contaminants

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
for which it is a sponge.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
will be made into fast-track trash.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
A large, unruly fraction of our trash

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
will flow downriver to the sea.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.160
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
In spite of deposit fees,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
Here is a remote island repository for bottles

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
off the coast of Baja California.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
from a different plastic, polypropylene.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
They will float in seawater,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
that make it to sea solo.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
while ours get caught in the California current

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
while ours litter the Philippines.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
of the North Pacific Gyre.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
It so happens that millions of albatross

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
nesting on Kure and Midway atolls

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
forage here and scavenge whatever they can find

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
for regurgitation to their chicks.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
died with this in its stomach.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.160
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
like cigarette lighters ...

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
but, mostly bottle caps.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
tossing about in the ocean surface.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
The retainer rings for the caps

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
also have consequences for aquatic animals.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
This is Mae West,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
I got plenty of takers.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I separated them by color

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
and put them on display the next Earth Day

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.160
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
they shook my hand. (Laughter)

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
from the gyre north of Hawaii

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
with more plastic than plankton.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
produces samples like this.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
And this.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
it looks like this.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
that contain more plastic than plankton?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
at the base of the food chain,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
was ingesting these poison pills.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
We did hundreds of necropsies,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
But no fishmonger on Earth

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.160
can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.160
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
The throwaway society cannot be contained --

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
it has gone global.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
We have to throw it away.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Now, the market can do a lot for us,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
the amount of packaging is increasing,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
and it's showing up in the ocean.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Straining the ocean for plastic

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
would be beyond the budget of any country

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
in Long Beach, California.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Charles Moore: Thank you.
