00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.416
We're at a tipping point in human history,

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:20.943
a species poised between gaining the stars
and losing the planet we call home.

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:24.062
Even in just the past few years,
we've greatly expanded

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:28.392
our knowledge of how Earth fits
within the context of our universe.

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:31.130
NASA's Kepler mission has discovered

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.079
thousands of potential planets
around other stars,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.273
indicating that Earth is but one
of billions of planets in our galaxy.

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:40.143
Kepler is a space telescope

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:44.434
that measures the subtle dimming of stars
as planets pass in front of them,

00:00:44.434 --> 00:00:47.282
blocking just a little bit
of that light from reaching us.

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:50.332
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:53.118
as well as their distance
from their parent star.

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:57.158
Together, this helps us understand
whether these planets are small and rocky,

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:59.713
like the terrestrial planets
in our own Solar System,

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:03.079
and also how much light they receive
from their parent sun.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.957
In turn, this provides clues as to whether
these planets that we discover

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.418
might be habitable or not.

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:13.481
Unfortunately, at the same time
as we're discovering this treasure trove

00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.594
of potentially habitable worlds,

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:19.054
our own planet is sagging
under the weight of humanity.

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:23.466
2014 was the hottest year on record.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.809
Glaciers and sea ice that have
been with us for millennia

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:29.944
are now disappearing
in a matter of decades.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:35.055
These planetary-scale environmental 
changes that we have set in motion

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:38.527
are rapidly outpacing our ability
to alter their course.

00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:43.062
But I'm not a climate scientist,
I'm an astronomer.

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:46.432
I study planetary habitability
as influenced by stars

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:48.890
with the hopes of finding
the places in the universe

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.862
where we might discover
life beyond our own planet.

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:55.402
You could say that I look for
choice alien real estate.

00:01:55.902 --> 00:02:00.244
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded
in the search for life in the universe,

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:03.611
I can tell you that the more
you look for planets like Earth,

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:07.257
the more you appreciate
our own planet itself.

00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:09.950
Each one of these new worlds
invites a comparison

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.572
between the newly discovered planet
and the planets we know best:

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:15.662
those of our own Solar System.

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:17.624
Consider our neighbor, Mars.

00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:21.409
Mars is small and rocky,
and though it's a bit far from the Sun,

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.934
it might be considered
a potentially habitable world

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.936
if found by a mission like Kepler.

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:29.303
Indeed, it's possible that Mars
was habitable in the past,

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:32.740
and in part, this is why
we study Mars so much.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.130
Our rovers, like Curiosity,
crawl across its surface,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.380
scratching for clues as to the origins
of life as we know it.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.886
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission
sample the Martian atmosphere,

00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:46.578
trying to understand how Mars
might have lost its past habitability.

00:02:46.578 --> 00:02:51.143
Private spaceflight companies now offer
not just a short trip to near space

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:54.844
but the tantalizing possibility
of living our lives on Mars.

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:56.794
But though these Martian vistas

00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.349
resemble the deserts
of our own home world,

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.921
places that are tied in our imagination
to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:06.593
compared to Earth

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:09.890
Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.164
Consider the extent to which
we have not colonized

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.068
the deserts of our own planet,

00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:17.901
places that are lush
by comparison with Mars.

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:20.687
Even in the driest,
highest places on Earth,

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:23.287
the air is sweet and thick with oxygen

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:27.374
exhaled from thousands of miles away
by our rainforests.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:33.318
I worry -- I worry that this excitement
about colonizing Mars and other planets

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.429
carries with it a long, dark shadow:

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.449
the implication and belief by some

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.002
that Mars will be there to save us
from the self-inflicted destruction

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:46.135
of the only truly habitable planet
we know of, the Earth.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.573
As much as I love
interplanetary exploration,

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:50.918
I deeply disagree with this idea.

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:53.611
There are many excellent reasons
to go to Mars,

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:57.025
but for anyone to tell you that Mars
will be there to back up humanity

00:03:57.025 --> 00:04:00.133
is like the captain of the Titanic
telling you that the real party

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.504
is happening later on the lifeboats.

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:05.453
(Laughter)

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.355
(Applause)

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:11.142
Thank you.

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:14.928
But the goals of interplanetary
exploration and planetary preservation

00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:17.109
are not opposed to one another.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.640
No, they're in fact two sides
of the same goal:

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.982
to understand, preserve
and improve life into the future.

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:28.045
The extreme environments
of our own world are alien vistas.

00:04:28.045 --> 00:04:29.926
They're just closer to home.

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:34.105
If we can understand how to create
and maintain habitable spaces

00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:37.495
out of hostile, inhospitable
spaces here on Earth,

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:40.932
perhaps we can meet the needs
of both preserving our own environment

00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:43.161
and moving beyond it.

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:45.471
I leave you with a final
thought experiment:

00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:47.166
Fermi's paradox.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:52.028
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi
asked that, given the fact

00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:54.875
that our universe has been around
for a very long time

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.545
and we expect that there
are many planets within it,

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.633
we should have found evidence
for alien life by now.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.676
So where are they?

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:06.043
Well, one possible solution
to Fermi's paradox

00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:09.526
is that, as civilizations become
technologically advanced enough

00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.848
to consider living amongst the stars,

00:05:11.848 --> 00:05:14.332
they lose sight of how important it is

00:05:14.332 --> 00:05:18.860
to safeguard the home worlds that fostered
that advancement to begin with.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.248
It is hubris to believe
that interplanetary colonization alone

00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:25.129
will save us from ourselves,

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.658
but planetary preservation
and interplanetary exploration

00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:30.552
can work together.

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:32.675
If we truly believe in our ability

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:36.181
to bend the hostile environments of Mars
for human habitation,

00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:39.767
then we should be able to surmount
the far easier task of preserving

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.940
the habitability of the Earth.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.986
Thank you.

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:49.516
(Applause)
