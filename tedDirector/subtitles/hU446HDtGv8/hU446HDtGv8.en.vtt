♫ Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo. ♫

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.160
♫ They have a tumor on their funny bone. ♫

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.160
♫ They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.160
♫ Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. ♫

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.160
♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what’s wrong with that? ♫

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
♫ Can't these chicks do anything but whine? ♫

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
♫ Dance break! Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫

♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum. ♫

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.160
♫ They say cheap objectification isn’t witty -- it’s hot! ♫

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
♫ Equal work and wages worth the fight -- ♫

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
♫ sing us a new one. ♫

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.160
♫ On-demand abortion every city -- OK, but no gun control. ♫

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.160
♫ Won’t these women ever get a life? ♫

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.160
♫ Feminists don’t have a sense of humor -- poor Hillary. ♫

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.160
♫ Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac. ♫

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.160
♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.160
♫ They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham, ♫

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.160
♫ that's why these feminists just need to find a man. ♫

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.160
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.160

I asked my mother, you know, should I say anything in support of anyone?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160
And she said, "Oh no! Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader."

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
(Laughter)

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.160
♫ I could show the world how to smile, ♫

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:40.160

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:53.160

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.160
♫ sail the mighty ocean wide. ♫

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:51.160

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:07.160
♫ I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or poor, rich or renowned. ♫

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:25.160
♫ There is nothing I couldn’t do, if I had you. ♫
