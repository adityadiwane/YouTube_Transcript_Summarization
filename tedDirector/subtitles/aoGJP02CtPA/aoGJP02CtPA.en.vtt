00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Today, I want you to look at

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
children who become suicide bombers

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
through a completely different lens.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
In 2009, there were 500

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
bomb blasts across Pakistan.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I spent the year working

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
with children

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
who were training to become suicide bombers

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and with Taliban recruiters,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
trying to understand how the Taliban

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
were converting these children

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
into live ammunition

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and why these children were actively

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
signing up to their cause.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I want you to watch a short video

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
(Singing)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
The Taliban now run their own schools.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
They target poor families

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and convince the parents to send their children.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
In return, they provide free food and shelter

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
We've obtained a propaganda video

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
made by the Taliban.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Young boys are taught justifications

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
for suicide attacks

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and the execution of spies.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I made contact with a child from Swat

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
who studied in a madrassa like this.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Hazrat Ali is from a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
poor farming family in Swat.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
He joined the Taliban a year ago

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
when he was 13.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Hazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Then they take us to a madrassa

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and teach us things from the Koran.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
are then given months of military training.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.260
HA: They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They ask us to use them only against the infidels.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
SOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
HA: If God gives me strength.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
SOC: I, in my research,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
have seen that the Taliban have perfected

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
the way in which they recruit

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and train children,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and I think it's a five-step process.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Step one is that the Taliban prey

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
on families that are large, that are poor,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that live in rural areas.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
They separate the parents from the children

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
by promising to provide food, clothing,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
shelter to these children.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
to hard-line schools

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that run along the Taliban agenda.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Step two:

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in Arabic, a language these children do not understand

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and cannot speak.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
They rely very heavily on teachers,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
who I have personally seen

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
distort the message to these children

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
as and when it suits their purpose to.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
These children are explicitly forbidden

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
from reading newspapers, listening to radio,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
reading any books

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that the teachers do not prescribe them.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
If any child is found violating these rules,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
he is severely reprimanded.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Effectively, the Taliban create

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
a complete blackout

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of any other source of information for these children.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Step three: The Taliban want these children

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to hate the world that they currently live in.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So they beat these children --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I have seen it;

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
they feed them twice a day dried bread and water;

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
they rarely allow them to play games;

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
they tell them that, for eight hours at a time,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
all they have to do is read the Koran.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The children are virtual prisoners;

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
they cannot leave, they cannot go home.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Their parents are so poor,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
they have no resources to get them back.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Step four: The older members of the Taliban,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
the fighters,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
start talking to the younger boys

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
about the glories of martyrdom.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
They talk to them about how when they die,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
they will be received up

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
with lakes of honey and milk,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
how there will be 72 virgins

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
waiting for them in paradise,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
how there will be unlimited food,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and how this glory

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
is going to propel them to become

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
heroes in their neighborhoods.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Effectively, this is the brainwashing process

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
that has begun.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Step five: I believe the Taliban have

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
one of the most effective

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
means of propaganda.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Their videos that they use

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
are intercut with photographs

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
of men and women and children

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
dying in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and in Pakistan.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And the basic message is that the Western powers

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
do not care about civilian deaths,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
so those people who live

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
in areas and support governments

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that work with Western powers are fair game.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
That's why Pakistani civilians,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
are fair game.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Now these children are primed

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
to become suicide bombers.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
They're ready to go out and fight

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
because they've been told that this is

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
effectively their only way

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to glorify Islam.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
This boy is called Zenola.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
He blew himself up, killing six.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This boy is called Sadik.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
He killed 22.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
This boy is called Messoud.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
He killed 28.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
The Taliban are running suicide schools,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
preparing a generation of boys

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
for atrocities against civilians.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Boy: I would love to.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
But only if I get permission from my dad.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
I get so inspired by their terrific attacks.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
SOC: What blessing would you get

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
from carrying out a suicide attack?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Boy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
"Why did you do that?"

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Then God will look at my intention.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.260
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
then I will be rewarded with paradise.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Singer: ♫ On the day of judgment ♫

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
♫ My God will call me ♫

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
♫ My body will be put back together ♫

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
SOC: I leave you all with this thought:

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
If you grew up in these circumstances,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
faced with these choices,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
would you choose to live in this world

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
or in the glorious afterlife?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
As one Taliban recruiter told me,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
"There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Thank you.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
(Applause)
