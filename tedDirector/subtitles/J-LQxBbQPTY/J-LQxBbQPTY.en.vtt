00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.596
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:24.746
create their identity in some kind of narrative form.

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.487
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:30.551
teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.341
Whether in cave paintings

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.971
or the latest uses of the Internet,

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.802
human beings have always told their histories and truths

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:41.259
through parable and fable.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.736
We are inveterate storytellers.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:49.119
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:53.217
do we offer communality of experience,

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:57.567
unmediated by our own furious consumerism?

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:01.067
And what narrative, what history,

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:03.748
what identity, what moral code

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:07.100
are we imparting to our young?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.982
Cinema is arguably

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:12.567
the 20th century's most influential art form.

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.617
Its artists told stories

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:15.899
across national boundaries,

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.767
in as many languages, genres and philosophies

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.017
as one can imagine.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.649
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.666
that film has yet to tackle.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.317
During the last decade

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.733
we've seen a vast integration of global media,

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.117
now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:34.533
We are increasingly offered a diet

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.017
in which sensation, not story, is king.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.450
What was common to us all 40 years ago --

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.249
the telling of stories between generations --

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.334
is now rarified.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.582
As a filmmaker, it worried me.

00:01:47.582 --> 00:01:51.449
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:53.866
What future could the young build

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.233
with so little grasp

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.017
of where they've come from

00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:00.075
and so few narratives of what's possible?

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:01.723
The irony is palpable;

00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:05.224
technical access has never been greater,

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:08.291
cultural access never weaker.

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:12.624
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,

00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:16.659
an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.741
followed by discussions.

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:22.474
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.542
maybe we could build a narrative

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.090
that would deliver meaning

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.173
to the fragmented and restless world of the young.

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:30.776
Given the access to technology,

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:34.507
even a school in a tiny rural hamlet

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:38.208
could project a DVD onto a white board.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.042
In the first nine months

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.390
we ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.458
with kids in age groups between five and 18

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.490
watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.374
The films were curated and contextualized.

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.125
But the choice was theirs,

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.941
and our audience quickly grew

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:59.174
to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.973
The outcome, immediate.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:07.559
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.891
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three,

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:13.607
these young people discovered new places,

00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:15.524
new thoughts, new perspectives.

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.658
By the time the pilot had finished,

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:20.491
we had the names of a thousand schools

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.310
that wished to join.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.931
The film that changed my life

00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.898
is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.651
It's a remarkable comment

00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.981
on slums, poverty and aspiration.

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.215
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:44.177
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:47.154
find and pay for the print and the projectionist.

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:48.826
But for my father,

00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:54.612
the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:57.243
that he chose to celebrate his half-century

00:03:57.243 --> 00:04:01.108
with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.460
"In order," he said,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.927
"to pass the baton of concern and hope

00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:08.410
on to the next generation."

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.177
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan,"

00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:15.127
slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.

00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:17.659
Sixty years after the film was made

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.860
and 30 years after I first saw it,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.410
I see young faces tilt up in awe,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.678
their incredulity matching mine.

00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:27.176
And the speed with which they associate it

00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:30.800
with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.748
speaks to the enduring nature.

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:36.865
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:38.781
we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:45.200
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.341
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.

00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:50.900
It shows how to do right,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.634
how to be heroically awkward.

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:55.384
It is also an expression of faith

00:04:55.384 --> 00:04:58.909
in the political machine as a force of honor.

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.392
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:07.058
there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.

00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:08.342
And it was with great delight

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:10.993
that we found young people up and down the country

00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:12.826
explaining with authority

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:14.842
what filibustering was

00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:20.359
and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:24.493
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.

00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:27.560
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda,"

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.843
they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.

00:05:30.843 --> 00:05:34.376
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.176
about unarmed peace-keeping forces

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:38.859
and the double-dealing of a Western society

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:42.793
that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:46.859
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget,

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:50.976
one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.245
"We already forgot,

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:56.259
otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.026
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:04.659
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.526
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:11.175
They celebrated a change in attitude

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:12.875
towards non-white Britons,

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:16.295
but railed against our restless school system

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:19.343
that does not value collective identity,

00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:25.410
unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.525
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:32.360
thought nothing of tackling films of all forms --

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.675
black and white, subtitled,

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:36.409
documentary, non-narrative, fantasy --

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.108
and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews

00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:42.592
that competed to favor one film over another

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:46.416
in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.

00:06:46.416 --> 00:06:49.582
Six thousand reviews each school week

00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:54.100
vying for the honor of being review of the week.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.160
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.242
until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids

00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:04.658
in 7,000 clubs right across the country.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.542
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,

00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:09.825
what became more extraordinary

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:13.375
was how the experience of critical and curious questioning

00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:15.893
translated into life.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.760
Some of our kids started talking with their parents,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.526
others with their teachers,

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:21.509
or with their friends.

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.209
And those without friends

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.410
started making them.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.726
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:33.843
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.

00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:38.260
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.061
and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.626
was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced

00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:47.176
in flight from violence

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.160
that killed first his father then his mother,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.042
the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.001
Who was right, who wrong?

00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:59.117
What would they do under the same conditions?

00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:00.666
Was the tale told well?

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.267
Was there a hidden message?

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:05.000
How has the world changed? How could it be different?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.884
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children

00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:11.634
who the world didn't think were interested.

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:15.105
And they themselves had not known they cared.

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:17.017
And as they wrote and debated,

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:19.983
rather than seeing the films as artifacts,

00:08:19.983 --> 00:08:25.049
they began to see themselves.

00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:28.214
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.

00:08:28.214 --> 00:08:30.368
In a moment she can invoke images

00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:34.333
of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:35.899
Quite recently she told me

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:39.298
that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father

00:08:39.298 --> 00:08:41.946
traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.

00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:46.412
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,

00:08:46.412 --> 00:08:50.146
it was these teenagers that fed the crew.

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:52.296
I was past 40 when my father died.

00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.848
He never mentioned that journey.

00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:58.533
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:01.930
without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.761
and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:07.045
After two years in hiding,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:09.879
my grandfather appeared in London.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:12.179
He was never right again.

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:16.880
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.818
My story started in England

00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:25.081
with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.232
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape,"

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:29.746
"Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.801
It was Leni Riefenstahl

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:34.584
in her elegant Nazi propaganda

00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:38.492
who gave context to what the family had to endure.

00:09:38.492 --> 00:09:44.142
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,

00:09:44.142 --> 00:09:46.492
and they became more useful to me

00:09:46.492 --> 00:09:49.209
than the whispers of survivors

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:52.144
and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo

00:09:52.144 --> 00:09:54.992
on a maiden aunt's wrist.

00:09:54.992 --> 00:09:57.775
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.776
the quest of real human understanding,

00:10:00.776 --> 00:10:02.275
that film is too crude

00:10:02.275 --> 00:10:04.709
to tell a complex and detailed history,

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:08.959
or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.093
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.

00:10:12.093 --> 00:10:15.360
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz,"

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.659
"Every person should watch this,

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.509
because unless you do

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:24.176
you may not know that you too have a heart."

00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:28.575
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?

00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:31.869
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:35.068
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson,

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:39.086
offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:40.835
that work together.

00:10:40.835 --> 00:10:42.369
Each a piece of memorable art,

00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:45.818
each a brick in the wall of who we are.

00:10:45.818 --> 00:10:48.685
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:50.735
better than astronaut Jim Lovell

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:55.299
or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:58.855
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:01.552
are an opportunity to discover

00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:03.968
what it is to be human,

00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:08.002
and no less helpful to understanding our life and times

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:13.752
as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.

00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:15.320
We guessed that film,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.319
whose stories are a meeting place

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:19.548
of drama, music, literature and human experience,

00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:24.053
would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:25.585
What we could not have foreseen

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:27.218
was the measurable improvements

00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:30.936
in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.

00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:35.218
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,

00:11:35.218 --> 00:11:36.703
fight, not on the playground,

00:11:36.703 --> 00:11:38.836
but to choose next week's film --

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:42.422
young people who have found self-definition, ambition

00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:46.669
and an appetite for education and social engagement

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:49.635
from the stories they have witnessed.

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:53.018
Our members defy the binary description

00:11:53.018 --> 00:11:55.836
of how we so often describe our young.

00:11:55.836 --> 00:12:00.819
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:02.586
They are, like other young people,

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:06.053
negotiating a world with infinite choice,

00:12:06.053 --> 00:12:10.753
but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.

00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:13.387
We appeared surprised at the behaviors

00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:15.385
of those who define themselves

00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:17.586
by the size of the tick on their shoes,

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:21.835
yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.

00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:23.652
If we want different values

00:12:23.652 --> 00:12:27.119
we have to tell a different story,

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:31.121
a story that understands that an individual narrative

00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:34.984
is an essential component of a person's identity,

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:36.753
that a collective narrative

00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:40.734
is an essential component of a cultural identity,

00:12:40.734 --> 00:12:44.468
and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself

00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:45.869
as part of a group.

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.925
Because when these people get home

00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:51.444
after a screening of "Rear Window"

00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:54.193
and raise their gaze to the building next door,

00:12:54.193 --> 00:12:57.858
they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,

00:12:57.858 --> 00:12:59.425
is out there

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.958
and what is their story.

00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.609
Thank you.

00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:06.291
(Applause)
