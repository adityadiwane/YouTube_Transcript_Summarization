00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.196
I started Improv Everywhere
about 10 years ago

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.716
when I moved to New York City
with an interest in acting and comedy.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.716
Because I was new to the city,
I didn't have access to a stage,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.116
so I decided to create
my own in public places.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.516
So the first project
we're going to take a look at

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.436
is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.436
Now, this took place in January of 2002.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.396
And this woman is the star of the video.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.156
She doesn't know she's being filmed.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.116
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.076
This is on the 6 train in New York City.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.196
And this is the first stop along the line.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.476
These are two Danish guys

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.900
who come in and sit down
next to the hidden camera.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.156
And that's me right there in a brown coat.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.836
It's about 30 degrees outside.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.396
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.540
And the girl's going
to notice me right here.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.516
(Laughter)

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.756
And as you'll see now,
I'm not wearing pants.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.876
(Laughter)

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.836
At this point --

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.356
at this point she's noticed me,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.996
but in New York there's weirdos
on any given train car.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.475
One person's not that unusual.

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.916
She goes back to reading her book,
which is unfortunately titled "Rape."

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.276
(Laughter)

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.836
So she's noticed the unusual thing,
but she's gone back to her normal life.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.796
Now, in the meantime, I have six friends

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.156
who are waiting
at the next six consecutive stops

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.836
in their underwear as well.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.196
They're going to be entering
this car one by one.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.716
We'll act as though
we don't know each other.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.756
And we'll act as if it's just
an unfortunate mistake we've made,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.956
forgetting our pants
on this cold January day.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.500
(Laughter)

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.460
(Laughter continues)

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.796
So at this point,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.156
she decides to put the rape book away.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.236
(Laughter)

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.596
And she decides to be a little bit
more aware of her surroundings.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.596
In the meantime, the two Danish guys
to the left of the camera,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.836
they're cracking up.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.836
They think this is the funniest thing
they've ever seen before.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.540
And watch her make eye contact
with them right about now.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.516
(Laughter)

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.356
And I love that moment in this video,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.956
because before it became
a shared experience,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.756
it was something
that was maybe a little bit scary,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.036
or something that was
at least confusing to her.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.156
And then, once it became
a shared experience,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.596
it was funny and something
that she could laugh at.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.220
So the train is now pulling
into the third stop along the 6 line.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.436
(Laughter)

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.156
So the video won't show everything.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.276
This goes on for another four stops.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.556
A total of seven guys
enter anonymously in their underwear.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.316
At the eighth stop,
a girl came in with a giant duffel bag

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.796
and announced she had
pants for sale for a dollar --

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.036
like you might sell batteries
or candy on the train.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.116
We all very matter-of-factly
bought a pair of pants, put them on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.876
and said, "Thank you.
That's exactly what I needed today,"

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.076
and then exited without
revealing what had happened

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.916
and went in all different directions.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.916
(Applause)

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.140
Thank you.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.676
So that's a still from the video there.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.676
And I love that girl's reaction so much.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.700
And watching that videotape later that day

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:54.036
inspired me to keep doing what I do.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.596
And really one of the points
of Improv Everywhere

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.636
is to cause a scene in a public place

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.876
that is a positive experience
for other people.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.356
It's a prank, but it's a prank
that gives somebody a great story to tell.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.756
And her reaction inspired me

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.796
to do a second annual
No Pants Subway Ride.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.725
And we've continued to do it every year.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.436
This January, we did
the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.796
where a diverse group of 3,500 people

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.076
rode the train in their
underwear in New York --

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.156
almost every single
train line in the city.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.556
And also in 50 other cities
around the world,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.796
people participated.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.956
(Laughter)

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.396
As I started taking improv class
at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.676
and meeting other creative people
and other performers and comedians,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.755
I started amassing
a mailing list of people

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.755
who wanted to do these types of projects.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.716
So I could do more large-scale projects.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.076
Well, one day I was walking
through Union Square,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.636
and I saw this building,
which had just been built in 2005.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.476
There was a girl in one of the windows
and she was dancing.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.676
It was very peculiar,
because it was dark out,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.916
but she was backlit
with florescent lighting.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.196
She was very much onstage

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.436
and I couldn't figure out
why she was doing it.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.636
After about 15 seconds,
her friend appeared --

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.476
she had been hiding behind a display.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.636
They laughed, hugged
each other and ran away.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.396
Maybe she had been dared to do this.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.716
So I got inspired by that.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.676
Looking at the entire facade --
there were 70 total windows --

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.076
and I knew what I had to do.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.636
(Laughter)

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.556
So this project is called Look Up More.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.156
We had 70 actors dress in black.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.796
This was completely unauthorized.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.956
We didn't let the stores know
we were coming.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.876
And I stood in the park giving signals.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.396
The first signal was for everybody
to hold up these four-foot tall letters

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.996
that spelled out "Look Up More,"

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.260
the name of the project.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.540
The second signal was for everybody
to do jumping jacks together.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.276
You'll see that start right here.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.756
(Laughter)

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.996
And then we had dancing.
We had everyone dance.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.356
And then we had dance solos

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.596
where only one person would dance
and everybody would point to them.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.356
(Laughter)

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.996
So then I gave a new hand signal,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.396
which signaled the next soloist
down below in Forever 21,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.700
and he danced.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.316
There were several other activities.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.756
We had people jumping up and down,
people dropping to the ground.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.236
And I was standing
just anonymously in a sweatshirt,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.516
putting my hand on and off of a trashcan
to signal the advancement.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.716
And because it was in Union Square Park,
right by a subway station,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.876
there were hundreds of people by the end
who stopped and looked up

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.420
and watched what we were doing.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.436
There's a better photo of it.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.236
So that particular event
was inspired by a moment

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.596
that I happened to stumble upon.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.116
The next project I want to show

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.956
was given to me
in an email from a stranger.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.316
A high school kid in Texas
wrote me in 2006

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.796
and said, "You should get
as many people as possible

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.396
to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.676
and go into a Best Buy and stand around."

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.116
(Laughter)

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.396
(Applause)

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.916
So I wrote this high school kid
back immediately

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.596
and I said, "Yes, you are correct.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.116
I think I'll try to do that
this weekend. Thank you."

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.516
So here's the video.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.036
So again, this is 2005.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.556
This is the Best Buy in New York City.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.356
We had about 80 people
show up to participate,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.676
entering one by one.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.177
There was an eight-year-old girl,
a 10-year-old girl.

00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:07.236
There was also a 65-year-old man
who participated.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.236
So a very diverse group of people.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.396
(Laughter)

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.076
And I told people,
"Don't work. Don't actually do work.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.316
But also, don't shop.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.756
Just stand around
and don't face products."

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.596
Now you can see the regular employees

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.116
by the ones that have
the yellow tags on their shirt.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.876
Everybody else is one of our actors.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.756
(Laughter)

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.236
The lower-level employees
thought it was very funny.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.236
Several of them went
to go get their camera from the break room

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.516
and took photos with us.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.596
A lot of them made jokes
about trying to get us to go to the back

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.236
to get heavy television sets
for customers.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.196
The managers and the security guards,
on the other hand,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.516
did not find it particularly funny.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.156
You can see them in this footage.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.796
They're wearing either
a yellow shirt or a black shirt.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.636
And we were there probably 10 minutes

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.156
before the managers decided to dial 911.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.436
(Laughter)

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.236
So they started running around

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.836
telling everybody the cops were coming,
"Watch out, the cops are coming."

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.476
And you can see the cops
in this footage right here.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.996
That's a cop wearing black right there,
being filmed with a hidden camera.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.676
Ultimately, the police
had to inform Best Buy management

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.276
that it was not, in fact, illegal
to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.596
(Laughter)

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.116
(Applause)

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.356
Thank you.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.076
(Applause)

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.516
So we had been there for 20 minutes;
we were happy to exit the store.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.596
One thing the managers were trying to do
was to track down our cameras.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.116
And they caught a couple of my guys
who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.045
But the one camera guy they never caught

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:36.276
was the guy that went in
just with a blank tape

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.516
and went over to the Best Buy
camera department

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.676
and just put his tape
in one of their cameras

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.940
and pretended to shop.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.916
So I like that concept of using
their own technology against them.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.636
(Laughter)

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.356
I think our best projects
are ones that are site-specific

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.556
and happen at a particular
place for a reason.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.533
And one morning, I was riding the subway.

00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:56.676
I had to make a transfer
at the 53rd St. stop

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.716
where there are
these two giant escalators.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.196
And it's a very depressing place
to be in the morning, it's very crowded.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.116
So I decided to try and stage something

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.780
that could make it as happy
as possible for one morning.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.156
So this was in the winter of 2009 --
8:30 in the morning.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.716
It's morning rush hour.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.476
It's very cold outside.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.116
People are coming in from Queens,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.036
transferring from the E train
to the 6 train.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.156
And they're going up
these giant escalators

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.718
on their way to their jobs.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.250
[Rob wants]

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:32.907
[to give you]

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:36.585
(Laughter)

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:37.862
[a high five!]

00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:40.330
(Laughter)

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:41.603
[Get ready!]

00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:48.596
(Laughter)

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:55.236
(Applause)

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.476
Thank you.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.516
So there's a photograph
that illustrates it a little bit better.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.196
He gave 2,000 high fives that day,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.596
and he washed his hands
before and afterward

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.036
and did not get sick.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.060
And that was done also without permission,

00:10:08.084 --> 00:10:10.196
although no one seemed to care.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.516
So I'd say over the years,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.756
one of the most common criticisms
I see of Improv Everywhere

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.676
left anonymously on YouTube comments

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.836
is: "These people
have too much time on their hands."

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.796
And you know, not everybody's
going to like everything you do,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.116
and I've certainly developed a thick skin
thanks to Internet comments,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.796
but that one's always bothered me,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.156
because we don't have
too much time on our hands.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.276
The participants
in Improv Everywhere events

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.956
have just as much leisure time
as any other New Yorkers,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.876
they just occasionally choose
to spend it in an unusual way.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.636
You know, every Saturday and Sunday,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.716
hundreds of thousands of people each fall

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.436
gather in football stadiums
to watch games.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.516
And I've never seen anybody comment,
looking at a football game,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.996
"All those people in the stands,
they have too much time on their hands."

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.276
And of course they don't.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.156
It's a perfectly wonderful way
to spent a weekend afternoon,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.036
watching a football game in a stadium.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.236
But I think it's also
a perfectly valid way

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.436
to spend an afternoon
freezing in place with 200 people

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.116
in the Grand Central terminal

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.436
or dressing up like a ghostbuster

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.716
and running through
the New York Public Library.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.836
(Laughter)

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.076
Or listening to the same MP3
as 3,000 other people

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.236
and dancing silently in a park,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.436
or bursting into song in a grocery store

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.676
as part of a spontaneous musical,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.116
or diving into the ocean in Coney Island
wearing formal attire.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.556
(Laughter)

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.516
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.916
And we're never given a reason
why we should play.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.156
It's just acceptable
that play is a good thing.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.916
And I think that's sort of
the point of Improv Everywhere.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.236
It's that there is no point
and that there doesn't have to be a point.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.276
We don't need a reason.
As long as it's fun

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.516
and it seems like
it's going to be a funny idea

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.836
and it seems like the people
who witness it

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.316
will also have a fun time,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.716
then that's enough for us.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.756
And I think, as adults, we need to learn

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.236
that there's no right
or wrong way to play.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.476
Thank you very much.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.339
(Applause)
