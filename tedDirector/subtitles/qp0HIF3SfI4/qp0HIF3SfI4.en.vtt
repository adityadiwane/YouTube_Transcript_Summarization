00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.236
How do you explain
when things don't go as we assume?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.236
Or better, how do you explain

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.236
when others are able to achieve things
that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.236
For example:

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.236
Why is Apple so innovative?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.236
Year after year, after year,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.236
they're more innovative
than all their competition.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.236
And yet, they're just a computer company.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.236
They're just like everyone else.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.450
They have the same access
to the same talent,

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:43.475
the same agencies,

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.355
the same consultants, the same media.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.839
Then why is it that they seem
to have something different?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.236
Why is it that Martin Luther King
led the Civil Rights Movement?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.236
He wasn't the only man
who suffered in pre-civil rights America,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.005
and he certainly wasn't
the only great orator of the day.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.236
Why him?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.236
And why is it that the Wright brothers

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.236
were able to figure out controlled,
powered man flight

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.410
when there were certainly other teams

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.307
who were better qualified,
better funded --

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.236
and they didn't achieve
powered man flight,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.235
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.147
There's something else at play here.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:25.236
About three and a half years ago,
I made a discovery.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.236
And this discovery profoundly changed
my view on how I thought the world worked,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and it even profoundly changed the way
in which I operate in it.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.236
As it turns out, there's a pattern.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.236
As it turns out, all the great inspiring
leaders and organizations in the world,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.275
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King
or the Wright brothers,

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.236
they all think, act and communicate
the exact same way.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.236
And it's the complete opposite
to everyone else.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.236
All I did was codify it,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.236
and it's probably
the world's simplest idea.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I call it the golden circle.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.236
Why? How? What?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.236
This little idea explains

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.236
why some organizations and some leaders
are able to inspire where others aren't.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.236
Let me define the terms really quickly.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.236
Every single person, every single
organization on the planet

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.982
knows what they do, 100 percent.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.236
Some know how they do it,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.944
whether you call it
your differentiated value proposition

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:36.236
or your proprietary process or your USP.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.007
But very, very few people or organizations
know why they do what they do.

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.236
And by "why" I don't mean
"to make a profit."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.236
That's a result. It's always a result.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.236
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.699
What's your cause? What's your belief?

00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:53.236
Why does your organization exist?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.628
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.236
And why should anyone care?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.165
As a result, the way we think, we act,

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.005
the way we communicate
is from the outside in, it's obvious.

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.720
We go from the clearest thing
to the fuzziest thing.

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:09.236
But the inspired leaders
and the inspired organizations --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.855
regardless of their size,
regardless of their industry --

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.005
all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.236
Let me give you an example.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.648
I use Apple because they're easy
to understand and everybody gets it.

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.243
If Apple were like everyone else,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:28.747
a marketing message from them
might sound like this:

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:30.256
"We make great computers.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.236
They're beautifully designed,
simple to use and user friendly.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.549
Want to buy one?"

00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:38.455
"Meh."

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.236
That's how most of us communicate.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.748
That's how most marketing
and sales are done,

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.867
that's how we communicate interpersonally.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.662
We say what we do,

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.455
we say how we're different or better

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.336
and we expect some sort of a behavior,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.336
a purchase, a vote, something like that.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.636
Here's our new law firm:

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.082
We have the best lawyers
with the biggest clients,

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:57.728
we always perform for our clients.

00:03:57.752 --> 00:03:59.236
Here's our new car:

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.892
It gets great gas mileage,
it has leather seats.

00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.105
Buy our car.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.236
But it's uninspiring.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.907
Here's how Apple actually communicates.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.236
"Everything we do,
we believe in challenging the status quo.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.236
We believe in thinking differently.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.691
The way we challenge the status quo

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:21.236
is by making our products
beautifully designed,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.236
simple to use and user friendly.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.899
We just happen to make great computers.

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:26.977
Want to buy one?"

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:29.455
Totally different, right?

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.436
You're ready to buy a computer from me.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.658
I just reversed
the order of the information.

00:04:33.682 --> 00:04:37.554
What it proves to us is
that people don't buy what you do;

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.983
people buy why you do it.

00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:44.236
This explains why
every single person in this room

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.236
is perfectly comfortable buying
a computer from Apple.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.236
But we're also perfectly comfortable

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.236
buying an MP3 player from Apple,
or a phone from Apple,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.237
or a DVR from Apple.

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.788
As I said before,
Apple's just a computer company.

00:04:56.812 --> 00:05:00.236
Nothing distinguishes them structurally
from any of their competitors.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.708
Their competitors are equally qualified
to make all of these products.

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:05.236
In fact, they tried.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.236
A few years ago, Gateway
came out with flat-screen TVs.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.689
They're eminently qualified
to make flat-screen TVs.

00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:13.236
They've been making
flat-screen monitors for years.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.833
Nobody bought one.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:23.236
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.236
and they make great quality products,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.236
and they can make perfectly
well-designed products --

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.060
and nobody bought one.

00:05:30.084 --> 00:05:32.536
In fact, talking about it now,
we can't even imagine

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.108
buying an MP3 player from Dell.

00:05:34.132 --> 00:05:36.336
Why would you buy one
from a computer company?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.957
But we do it every day.

00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:40.472
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:46.021
The goal is not to do business
with everybody who needs what you have.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:50.108
The goal is to do business with people
who believe what you believe.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.887
Here's the best part:

00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:55.236
None of what I'm telling you
is my opinion.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.236
It's all grounded
in the tenets of biology.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.236
Not psychology, biology.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.999
If you look at a cross-section
of the human brain,

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:05.656
from the top down,
the human brain is actually broken

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.236
into three major components

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.236
that correlate perfectly
with the golden circle.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.236
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.236
our neocortex,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.236
corresponds with the "what" level.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.236
The neocortex is responsible

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.236
for all of our rational
and analytical thought and language.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.236
The middle two sections make up
our limbic brains,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.236
and our limbic brains are responsible
for all of our feelings,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.236
like trust and loyalty.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.403
It's also responsible
for all human behavior,

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.236
all decision-making,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.236
and it has no capacity for language.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.236
In other words, when we communicate
from the outside in,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.403
yes, people can understand vast
amounts of complicated information

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:48.236
like features and benefits
and facts and figures.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.236
It just doesn't drive behavior.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.356
When we can communicate
from the inside out,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.619
we're talking directly
to the part of the brain

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:56.236
that controls behavior,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.236
and then we allow people to rationalize it
with the tangible things we say and do.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.810
This is where gut decisions come from.

00:07:02.834 --> 00:07:06.236
Sometimes you can give somebody
all the facts and figures,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.982
and they say, "I know
what all the facts and details say,

00:07:09.006 --> 00:07:10.536
but it just doesn't feel right."

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.100
Why would we use that verb,
it doesn't "feel" right?

00:07:13.124 --> 00:07:15.899
Because the part of the brain
that controls decision-making

00:07:15.923 --> 00:07:17.236
doesn't control language.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.721
The best we can muster up is,

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:20.798
"I don't know. 
It just doesn't feel right."

00:07:20.822 --> 00:07:24.236
Or sometimes you say you're leading
with your heart or soul.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.932
I hate to break it to you,
those aren't other body parts

00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:28.236
controlling your behavior.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.403
It's all happening here
in your limbic brain,

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:33.713
the part of the brain that controls
decision-making and not language.

00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:36.236
But if you don't know
why you do what you do,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.236
and people respond
to why you do what you do,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.236
then how will you ever get people

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.308
to vote for you,
or buy something from you,

00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:46.236
or, more importantly, be loyal

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.236
and want to be a part
of what it is that you do.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.310
The goal is not just to sell
to people who need what you have;

00:07:52.334 --> 00:07:55.236
the goal is to sell to people
who believe what you believe.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.236
The goal is not just
to hire people who need a job;

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.236
it's to hire people
who believe what you believe.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.380
I always say that, you know,

00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:10.236
if you hire people just because they can
do a job, they'll work for your money,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.051
but if they believe what you believe,

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.510
they'll work for you with blood
and sweat and tears.

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:18.236
Nowhere else is there a better example
than with the Wright brothers.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.874
Most people don't know
about Samuel Pierpont Langley.

00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:24.236
And back in the early 20th century,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.403
the pursuit of powered man flight
was like the dot com of the day.

00:08:27.427 --> 00:08:29.236
Everybody was trying it.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.236
And Samuel Pierpont Langley
had, what we assume,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.933
to be the recipe for success.

00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:36.656
Even now, you ask people,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.299
"Why did your product
or why did your company fail?"

00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:41.584
and people always give
you the same permutation

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:43.029
of the same three things:

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:46.030
under-capitalized, the wrong people,
bad market conditions.

00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:48.865
It's always the same three things,
so let's explore that.

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:51.236
Samuel Pierpont Langley

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.236
was given 50,000 dollars
by the War Department

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.236
to figure out this flying machine.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.831
Money was no problem.

00:08:57.855 --> 00:09:00.236
He held a seat at Harvard

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and worked at the Smithsonian
and was extremely well-connected;

00:09:03.284 --> 00:09:05.236
he knew all the big minds of the day.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.236
He hired the best minds money could find

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.236
and the market conditions were fantastic.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.236
The New York Times
followed him around everywhere,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.236
and everyone was rooting for Langley.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.248
Then how come we've never heard
of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:21.886
A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:24.236
Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.236
they had none of what we consider
to be the recipe for success.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.236
They had no money;

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.499
they paid for their dream
with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.

00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:35.809
Not a single person
on the Wright brothers' team

00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:37.236
had a college education,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.236
not even Orville or Wilbur.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.236
And The New York Times
followed them around nowhere.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.236
The difference was,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.236
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
by a purpose, by a belief.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.236
They believed that if they could
figure out this flying machine,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.057
it'll change the course of the world.

00:09:55.644 --> 00:09:57.593
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.

00:09:57.617 --> 00:10:00.236
He wanted to be rich,
and he wanted to be famous.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.236
He was in pursuit of the result.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.236
He was in pursuit of the riches.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.214
And lo and behold, look what happened.

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:09.784
The people who believed
in the Wright brothers' dream

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.236
worked with them with blood
and sweat and tears.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.236
The others just worked for the paycheck.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.455
They tell stories of how every time
the Wright brothers went out,

00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:19.486
they would have to take
five sets of parts,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.524
because that's how many times
they would crash before supper.

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:27.943
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:30.236
the Wright brothers took flight,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.308
and no one was there
to even experience it.

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.411
We found out about it a few days later.

00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:40.037
And further proof that Langley
was motivated by the wrong thing:

00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:42.395
the day the Wright brothers took flight,

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:43.420
he quit.

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:45.236
He could have said,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.236
"That's an amazing discovery, guys,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.236
and I will improve
upon your technology," but he didn't.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.851
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,
he didn't get famous, so he quit.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.470
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:10:57.494 --> 00:10:59.236
If you talk about what you believe,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.236
you will attract those
who believe what you believe.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.594
But why is it important to attract
those who believe what you believe?

00:11:07.664 --> 00:11:10.217
Something called the law
of diffusion of innovation,

00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:12.751
if you don't know the law,
you know the terminology.

00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:17.236
The first 2.5% of our population
are our innovators.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.473
The next 13.5% of our population
are our early adopters.

00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:24.356
The next 34% are your early majority,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.713
your late majority and your laggards.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:30.236
The only reason these people
buy touch-tone phones

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.499
is because you can't buy
rotary phones anymore.

00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:34.236
(Laughter)

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.236
We all sit at various places
at various times on this scale,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.236
but what the law of diffusion
of innovation tells us

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.236
is that if you want mass-market success
or mass-market acceptance of an idea,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.236
you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.236
between 15 and 18 percent
market penetration,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.236
and then the system tips.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.505
I love asking businesses,
"What's your conversion on new business?"

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:01.162
They love to tell you,
"It's about 10 percent," proudly.

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:03.329
Well, you can trip
over 10% of the customers.

00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:05.299
We all have about 10% who just "get it."

00:12:05.323 --> 00:12:07.036
That's how we describe them, right?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.537
That's like that gut feeling,
"Oh, they just get it."

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:11.997
The problem is: How do you
find the ones that get it

00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:14.665
before doing business
versus the ones who don't get it?

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:18.236
So it's this here, this little gap
that you have to close,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.641
as Jeffrey Moore calls it,
"Crossing the Chasm" --

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:24.236
because, you see, the early majority
will not try something

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.236
until someone else has tried it first.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.236
And these guys, the innovators
and the early adopters,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.451
they're comfortable
making those gut decisions.

00:12:33.475 --> 00:12:36.236
They're more comfortable
making those intuitive decisions

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.236
that are driven by what
they believe about the world

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.236
and not just what product is available.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.907
These are the people who stood
in line for six hours

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.067
to buy an iPhone when they first came out,

00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:50.236
when you could have bought one
off the shelf the next week.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.403
These are the people
who spent 40,000 dollars

00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:55.236
on flat-screen TVs
when they first came out,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.569
even though the technology
was substandard.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.236
And, by the way, they didn't do it
because the technology was so great;

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.236
they did it for themselves.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.236
It's because they wanted to be first.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.737
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it

00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:12.236
and what you do simply proves
what you believe.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.236
In fact, people will do the things
that prove what they believe.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.236
The reason that person bought the iPhone
in the first six hours,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.236
stood in line for six hours,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.641
was because of what they believed
about the world,

00:13:25.665 --> 00:13:27.665
and how they wanted everybody to see them:

00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:28.721
they were first.

00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:31.236
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.236
So let me give you a famous example,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.823
a famous failure and a famous success
of the law of diffusion of innovation.

00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:39.236
First, the famous failure.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.236
It's a commercial example.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.497
As we said before, the recipe for success

00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:46.913
is money and the right people
and the right market conditions.

00:13:46.937 --> 00:13:48.682
You should have success then.

00:13:48.706 --> 00:13:50.236
Look at TiVo.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.975
From the time TiVo came out
about eight or nine years ago

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.237
to this current day,

00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:57.911
they are the single highest-quality
product on the market,

00:13:57.935 --> 00:13:59.808
hands down, there is no dispute.

00:14:00.855 --> 00:14:02.662
They were extremely well-funded.

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:04.385
Market conditions were fantastic.

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:06.236
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.519
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk
Time Warner DVR all the time.

00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:11.586
(Laughter)

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.236
But TiVo's a commercial failure.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.236
They've never made money.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.236
And when they went IPO,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.236
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.689
and then plummeted,
and it's never traded above 10.

00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:25.236
In fact, I don't think
it's even traded above six,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.236
except for a couple of little spikes.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.594
Because you see, when TiVo
launched their product,

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.236
they told us all what they had.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.714
They said, "We have a product
that pauses live TV,

00:14:35.738 --> 00:14:40.236
skips commercials, rewinds live TV
and memorizes your viewing habits

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.049
without you even asking."

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:45.236
And the cynical majority said,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.236
"We don't believe you.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.808
We don't need it. We don't like it.

00:14:49.832 --> 00:14:50.895
You're scaring us."

00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.236
What if they had said,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.236
"If you're the kind of person
who likes to have total control

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.236
over every aspect of your life,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.236
boy, do we have a product for you.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.238
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,

00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:08.422
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."

00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:11.632
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it,

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:15.017
and what you do simply serves
as the proof of what you believe.

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:19.863
Now let me give you a successful example
of the law of diffusion of innovation.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.236
In the summer of 1963,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.236
250,000 people showed up
on the mall in Washington

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.912
to hear Dr. King speak.

00:15:31.414 --> 00:15:34.236
They sent out no invitations,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.236
and there was no website
to check the date.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.236
How do you do that?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.403
Well, Dr. King
wasn't the only man in America

00:15:41.427 --> 00:15:43.830
who was a great orator.

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:46.020
He wasn't the only man
in America who suffered

00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:47.822
in a pre-civil rights America.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.236
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.283
But he had a gift.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.491
He didn't go around telling people
what needed to change in America.

00:15:55.515 --> 00:15:57.832
He went around
and told people what he believed.

00:15:57.856 --> 00:16:01.236
"I believe, I believe, I believe,"
he told people.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.791
And people who believed what he believed

00:16:03.815 --> 00:16:07.236
took his cause, and they made it
their own, and they told people.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.308
And some of those people
created structures

00:16:09.332 --> 00:16:11.827
to get the word out to even more people.

00:16:11.851 --> 00:16:15.236
And lo and behold,
250,000 people showed up

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.506
on the right day at the right time
to hear him speak.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.762
How many of them showed up for him?

00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:25.611
Zero.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.236
They showed up for themselves.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.962
It's what they believed about America

00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:33.236
that got them to travel
in a bus for eight hours

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.236
to stand in the sun in Washington
in the middle of August.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.308
It's what they believed,
and it wasn't about black versus white:

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.645
25% of the audience was white.

00:16:42.657 --> 00:16:46.260
Dr. King believed that there are
two types of laws in this world:

00:16:46.284 --> 00:16:50.236
those that are made by a higher authority
and those that are made by men.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.236
And not until all the laws
that are made by men

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.053
are consistent with the laws
made by the higher authority

00:16:56.077 --> 00:16:58.013
will we live in a just world.

00:16:58.037 --> 00:17:00.452
It just so happened
that the Civil Rights Movement

00:17:00.476 --> 00:17:04.236
was the perfect thing to help him
bring his cause to life.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.236
We followed, not for him,
but for ourselves.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.561
By the way, he gave
the "I have a dream" speech,

00:17:09.585 --> 00:17:11.570
not the "I have a plan" speech.

00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:15.236
(Laughter)

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.451
Listen to politicians now,
with their comprehensive 12-point plans.

00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:20.236
They're not inspiring anybody.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.236
Because there are leaders
and there are those who lead.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.236
Leaders hold a position
of power or authority,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
but those who lead inspire us.

00:17:31.793 --> 00:17:34.144
Whether they're individuals
or organizations,

00:17:34.168 --> 00:17:37.236
we follow those who lead,
not because we have to,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.097
but because we want to.

00:17:40.045 --> 00:17:44.483
We follow those who lead, not for them,
but for ourselves.

00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:48.236
And it's those who start with "why"

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.000
that have the ability
to inspire those around them

00:17:53.024 --> 00:17:55.235
or find others who inspire them.

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:57.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:57.664 --> 00:17:59.260
(Applause)
