00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
You know, we're going to do things a little differently.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And at the same time, we're going to look at just images

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that --

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
that you see on screen that come from there.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
a little bit more and think and ask questions.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
You know, I guess the first question is,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160
why build a virtual world at all?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And I think the answer to that is always going to be

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
at least driven to a certain extent by the people

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
initially crazy enough to start the project, you know.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:34.160
I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I was just always trying to make things.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
or electronics or metal or anything else.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And so, for example -- and it's a great Second Life thing -- I had a bedroom.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to --

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
rather than opened, like on Star Trek.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I built -- I put a garage-door opener up in the attic

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
that would pull this door up.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.160
You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and the displeasure of my parents.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.160
could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.160
but are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things --

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
to actually cobble together the materials

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
and go through the actual execution phase of building something

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
that you imagine from a design perspective.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and I was doing computer programming and just, you know,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
just generally trying to run my own little company

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.160
I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
would be to use the Internet and connected computers

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.160
to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
and the rules of how things went together --

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
I just wanted this place where you could build things.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And so I think you see that in the genesis

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160
of what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.160
I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.160
as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
It is a -- sort of a great human progress.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.160
Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
in as shared and social a way as possible.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
represent the best we can do to achieve that right now.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
You know, another way to look at that,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.160
If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
So many movies, so many kids, we all sort of

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
dream about exploring space. Now, why is that?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Stop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Why do we as people want to do that?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies --

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
you know, it's this dream that we all share.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
In some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
because there wouldn't be -- you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
And so inevitably, you would transform yourself --

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160
irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160
that if you travel far enough, you can find out there --

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
once you get there, into space.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
It's going to be different than here.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
that anything is going to be possible.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160
creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
And I think that if you really sit and think about it,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
virtual worlds, and where we're going

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.160
with more and more computing technology,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.160
represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
version of space exploration.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160
We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
and everything, and probably anything could happen there.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
everybody's very excited,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
from moment to moment, and then there's despair

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Everything that's happening with Second Life

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
We always play a game at the office where you can take any article

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
and find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
You can find exactly the same articles

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
written about everything that people are observing.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.160
To give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
It's about 20,000 computers connected together

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
in three facilities in the United States right now,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
and it's about as densely built out.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
So it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly --

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
And so of course, radically unlike the real world,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
very, very quickly, and historically exponentially.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
by the amount of content that's in there,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
and I think that amount is critical.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
It was critical with the virtual world

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
that it be this space of truly infinite possibility.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
We're very sensitive to that as humans.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
and you know when you can't.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
they have code attached to them.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and that's very important.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
If anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
Second Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.160
of user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
what's happening here is something very different,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
because the sheer scale of what people can do

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.160
when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
that whatever this is going to evolve into

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And let me justify that with two statements.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
create and consume information.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.160
It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
is kind of us flowing through a sea of information

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
and interacting with it in different ways.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.160
The Web puts information in the form of text and images.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.160
The topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
That's one way of organizing information,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.160
but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
that I think are the important ways that they're very different

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
The first is that, as I said, the --

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
well, the first difference for virtual worlds is that

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
information is presented to you in the virtual world

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
using the most powerful iconic symbols

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
that you can possibly use with human beings.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.160
So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
but a picture of this is a universal symbol.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
It's also more memorable if I show you that picture,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
and I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
You can do tests that show that you'll remember

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.160
you maximally both excite, stimulate,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And so virtual worlds are the best way

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.160
for us to essentially organize and experience information.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years --

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
are really important in some magical way to us.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160
But the second thing -- and I think this one is less obvious --

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:22.160
is that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.160
is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
You are always there with other people.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:36.160
And we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.160
or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
It's essential to us. You can't escape it.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160
When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:55.160
you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
but you can't talk to them.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
on the same page as you, and ask them,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
is an example of how as social creatures

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
we want to experience information in that way.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.160
So that second point, that we inherently experience information together

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
or want to experience it together,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
is critical to essentially, kind of,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160
this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.160
And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.160
these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
to be together, to consume information.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
You know, mapping in India -- that's such a great example.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.160
Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.160
Asking for advice, rather than any possible way

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
that you could just statically organize a map.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
So I think that's another big point.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
I think that wherever this is all going,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160
whether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
that happens all around the world at a lot of different points --

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.160
so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
Big idea, but I think highly defensible.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
So let me stop there and bring John back,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
Thank you. John. That's great.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.160
(Applause)

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.160
John Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
not a utopian impulse?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
Like for example, in the 19th century,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.160
any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
were explicitly utopian.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.160
Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.160
That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
only happens in an environment

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
if you will, that make up the virtual world.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.160
Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
even if you mean well when you build them.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.160
And what's more, human society, when it's controlled,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
when you set out a grand scheme of rules,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160
a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
that, you know, has been built.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
JH: The Kremlin was pretty big.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
PR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
JH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
in the creation of their avatars or in communicating

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.160
that people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.160
and name something that you didn't come up with

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
that almost immediately people began to demand.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
PR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life --

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
I was really passionate about it.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
and have a more private conversation,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately --

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
I think we've now turned it off, if I remember.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
We finally gave up, took it out of the code.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160
But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
which is great relative to the utopian idea.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Second Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
So when it only had 16,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
it was only about as big as this college campus.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
we put a disco where you could dance,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And we laid out the zoning, but of course,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
people could build all around it however they wanted to.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.160
And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
was instantly and thoroughly ignored,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and like, two months into the whole thing,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
-- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time --

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.160
I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160
the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.160
because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
and put houses on it. And I sold it to them --

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
and blew up the entire building.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.160
And I remember that that was just so telling, you know,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.160
that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular --

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
JH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.160
PR: Exactly. And it -- but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
You can have a baby in Second Life.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.160
This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.160
so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course --

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.160
Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab --

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
There is no attempt to structure the experience,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
taking two avatars and merging them, or something.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.160
But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.160
as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so --

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
what goes on in the overall economy.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160
I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160
When people are given the opportunity to create in the world,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
there's really two things they want.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
One is fair ownership of the things they create.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
And then the second one is -- if they feel like it,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160
and they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are --

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
they want to actually be able to sell that creation

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
as a way of providing for their own livelihood.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.160
True on the Web -- also true in Second Life.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
And so the existence of an economy is critical.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.160
JH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
(Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.)

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.160
JH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160
an avatar, in Second Life.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
PR: But I don't look like my avatar.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.160
(Laughter)

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
How many people here know what my avatar looks like?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
That's probably not very many.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160
JH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of --

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
PR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar --

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
a female avatar -- that I used to be once in a while.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.160
But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.160
Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.160
Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160
So, very cool.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
JH: And your question?

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.160
(Audience: [Unclear].)

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.160
JH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
It doesn't seem to have its own culture,

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.160
and the sort of differences that exist in the real world

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.160
aren't translated into the Second Life map.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
PR: Well, first of all, we're very early,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160
so this has only been going on for a few years.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160
And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
that you see in emerging societies.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.160
So a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of Second Life today is that

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.160
it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.160
That said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.160
65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.160
and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.160
In fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Life

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.160
is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160
and they basically, kind of, pop up on your screen

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.160
and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.160
or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.160
translate spoken -- I'm sorry -- typed text between individuals.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.160
And so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160
that's happening inside Second Life is quite --

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.160
I think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.160
in the real world we've ever been able to achieve.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160
So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.160
but we still have some years to wait while that happens,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.160
as you would naturally expect.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.160
JH: Other questions? Right here.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
(Audience: What's your demographic?)

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.160
JH: What's your demographic?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
PR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.160
So, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.160
however, the use of Second Life increases dramatically

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.160
as your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 --

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160
and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life --

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.160
this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very, very distributed --

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.160
usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.160
as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not --

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160
many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.160
is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing --

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.160
I'm just speaking broadly and critically --

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.160
it's not very appealing to people that play online video games,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.160
because the graphics are not yet equivalent to --

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.160
I mean, these are very nice pictures,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.160
but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.160
to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.160
So average age: 32. I mentioned

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.160
65 percent of the users are not in the United States.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.160
The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.160
There's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.160
The dominant ones are -- if you take the UK and Europe,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.160
together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
In terms of psychographic --

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.160
oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.160
so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
Women use Second Life, though,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.160
about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.160
meaning that more men sign up than women,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.160
and more women stay and use it than men.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160
So that's another demographic fact.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.160
In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.160
are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.160
challenge you to just do this and find out.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.160
But it's not a bunch of programmers.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.160
It's not easy to describe as a demographic.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.160
If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.160
who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.160
Maybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.160
They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.160
A lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive:

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.160
they're making money from what -- I mean, real-world money --

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.160
from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build --

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.160
still a creative, building things, build-your-own-business

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.160
type of an orientation. So, that's it.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.160
JH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.160
when you were young and, you know, liked to make things.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160
I mean, it's not often that you hear somebody

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.160
describe themselves as really creative.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.160
I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.160
who spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160
(Laughter)

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.160
PR: I was a -- there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.160
When I got to college -- I studied physics in college --

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.160
and I got really -- it was funny,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.160
because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.160
I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.160
Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.160
So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.160
and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.160
JH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.160
PR: If you count, yeah, cities. So -- but I did --

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.160
and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.160
I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.160
I was going to say, I had a great social experience

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.160
when I went to college that I hadn't had before,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.160
a more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.160
who I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.160
so then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.160
JH: Last question. Right here.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.160
(Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement -- )

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160
JH: You want to paraphrase that?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160
PR: Yeah, so let me restate that.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.160
that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones --

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.160
our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities --

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.160
and that in fact, much of human life and human experience

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.160
may move into the digital realm.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.160
And then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.160
That's a frightening change, frightening disruption.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.160
I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I --

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.160
JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.160
(Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.160
what would be your response?)

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.160
PR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.160
One is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.160
That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.160
So, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.160
or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160
from connecting us together,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160
because the basic motive that people have --

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.160
to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.160
into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.160
So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.160
Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.160
but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.160
disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.160
has to conclude, based on the data,

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.160
that with those kinds of economic forces at play,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.160
there is definitely going to be a sea change,

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.160
and that change is going to be intensely disruptive

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.160
relative to our concept of our very lives and being,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
and our identities, as well.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.160
I don't think we can get away from those changes.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.160
I think generally, we were talking about this --

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:22.160
I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.160
being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.160
is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.160
because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.160
the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.160
It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.160
We must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:52.160
and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.160
than we are typically in our real lives.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.160
And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.160
then these changes, though scary -- and, I say, inevitable --

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160
are ultimately for the better,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.160
and therefore something that we should ride out.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.160
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.160
other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.160
because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.160
JH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.160
(Applause)
