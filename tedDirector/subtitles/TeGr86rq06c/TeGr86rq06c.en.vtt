00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.496
What if I told you
there was a new technology

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.088
that, when placed in the hands
of doctors and nurses,

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:26.255
improved outcomes for children
and adults, patients of all ages;

00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:29.854
reduced pain and suffering,

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:33.067
reduced time in the operating rooms,

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.944
reduced anesthetic times,

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.866
had the ultimate dose-response curve

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.636
that the more you did it,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.982
the better it benefitted patients?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.562
Here's a kicker: it has no side effects,

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:48.603
and it's available no matter
where care is delivered.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.767
I can tell you as an ICU doctor
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.098
this would be a game changer for me.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.755
That technology is lifelike rehearsal.

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:05.079
This lifelike rehearsal is being delivered
through medical simulation.

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.712
I thought I would start with a case,

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.446
just to really describe
the challenge ahead,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.841
and why this technology is not just
going to improve health care

00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:18.555
but why it's critical to health care.

00:01:19.388 --> 00:01:22.261
This is a child that's born, young girl.

00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:24.045
"Day of life zero," we call it,

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.368
the first day of life,
just born into the world.

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:27.783
And just as she's being born,

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:30.239
we notice very quickly
that she is deteriorating.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.672
Her heart rate is going up,
her blood pressure is going down,

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:35.338
she's breathing very, very fast.

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:40.999
And the reason for this
is displayed in this chest X-ray.

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:42.334
That's called a babygram,

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:45.632
a full X-ray of a child's body,
a little infant's body.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.562
As you look on the top side of this,

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:50.069
that's where the heart and lungs
are supposed to be.

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.870
As you look at the bottom end,
that's where the abdomen is,

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:55.316
and that's where the intestines
are supposed to be.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.069
And you can see how
there's sort of that translucent area

00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:01.264
that made its way up into the right side
of this child's chest.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.296
And those are the intestines --
in the wrong place.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.490
As a result, they're pushing on the lungs

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:10.485
and making it very difficult
for this poor baby to breathe.

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:12.531
The fix for this problem

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:15.209
is to take this child immediately
to the operating room,

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.364
bring those intestines
back into the abdomen,

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:18.803
let the lungs expand

00:02:18.827 --> 00:02:20.708
and allow this child to breathe again.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.366
But before she can go
to the operating room,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.682
she must get whisked away
to the ICU, where I work.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:28.574
I work with surgical teams.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:29.900
We gather around her,

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:34.025
and we place this child
on heart-lung bypass.

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.037
We put her to sleep,

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:39.657
we make a tiny
little incision in the neck,

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.819
we place catheters into the major
vessels of the neck --

00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:46.537
and I can tell you that these vessels
are about the size of a pen,

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.466
the tip of a pen --

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.574
and then we have blood
drawn from the body,

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:53.006
we bring it through a machine,
it gets oxygenated,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.882
and it goes back into the body.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.482
We save her life,

00:02:56.506 --> 00:02:59.030
and get her safely to the operating room.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.148
Here's the problem:

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:05.265
these disorders --

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.578
what is known is congenital
diaphragmatic hernia --

00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:12.198
this hole in the diaphragm that has
allowed these intestines to sneak up --

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:14.188
these disorders are rare.

00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:18.938
Even in the best hands in the world,

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:22.472
there is still a challenge
to get the volume --

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:24.394
the natural volume of these patients --

00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:26.940
in order to get our expertise
curve at 100 percent.

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:29.064
They just don't present that often.

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.455
So how do you make the rare common?

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.218
Here's the other problem:

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.780
in the health care system
that I trained for over 20 years,

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:43.989
what currently exists,

00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.957
the model of training is called
the apprenticeship model.

00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:48.896
It's been around for centuries.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.868
It's based on this idea that you see
a surgery maybe once,

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:54.420
maybe several times,

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:57.234
you then go do that surgery,

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.816
and then ultimately you teach
that surgery to the next generation.

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:05.012
And implicit in this model --

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.210
I don't need to tell you this --

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:12.191
is that we practice on the very patients
that we are delivering care to.

00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:15.802
That's a problem.

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:21.293
I think there's a better approach.

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:25.682
Medicine may very well be the last
high-stakes industry

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:28.428
that does not practice prior to game time.

00:04:30.128 --> 00:04:34.310
I want to describe to you a better
approach through medical simulation.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.516
Well, the first thing we did is we went
to other high-stakes industries

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.410
that had been using this type
of methodology for decades.

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:44.099
This is nuclear power.

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:48.164
Nuclear power runs scenarios
on a regular basis

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:51.405
in order to practice
what they hope will never occur.

00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:55.780
And as we're all very familiar,
the airline industry --

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:59.101
we all get on planes now,
comforted by the idea

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:04.921
that pilots and crews have trained
on simulators much like these,

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:07.506
training on scenarios
that we hope will never occur,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.710
but we know if they did,

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:12.247
they would be prepared for the worst.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.155
In fact, the airline industry has gone
as far as to create fuselages

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:18.722
of simulation environments,

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:21.987
because of the importance
of the team coming together.

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.897
This is an evacuation drill simulator.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:29.393
So again, if that ever were to happen,
these rare, rare events,

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.707
they're ready to act
on the drop of a dime.

00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:40.024
I guess the most compelling for me
in some ways is the sports industry --

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.680
arguably high stakes.

00:05:42.293 --> 00:05:45.554
You think about a baseball team:
baseball players practice.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:48.249
I think it's a beautiful example
of progressive training.

00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:51.033
The first thing they do
is go out to spring training.

00:05:51.057 --> 00:05:53.321
They go to a spring training camp,

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.864
perhaps a simulator in baseball.

00:05:56.392 --> 00:05:59.434
They're not on the real field,
but they're on a simulated field,

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:01.491
and they're playing in the pregame season.

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:05.012
Then they make their way to the field
during the season games,

00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:08.134
and what's the first thing they do
before they start the game?

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:12.589
They go into the batting cage
and do batting practice for hours,

00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:15.944
having different types of pitches
being thrown at them,

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:20.300
hitting ball after ball
as they limber their muscles,

00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:22.297
getting ready for the game itself.

00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:25.171
And here's the most
phenomenal part of this,

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.845
and for all of you who watch
any sport event,

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:30.784
you will see this phenomenon happen.

00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:34.349
The batter gets into the batter's box,

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:36.494
the pitcher gets ready to pitch.

00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:39.624
Right before the pitch is thrown,

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:40.857
what does that batter do?

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.785
The batter steps out of the box

00:06:44.097 --> 00:06:46.140
and takes a practice swing.

00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:47.989
He wouldn't do it any other way.

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:52.627
I want to talk to you about how
we're building practice swings like this

00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:53.806
in medicine.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.012
We are building batting cages
for the patients that we care about

00:06:58.036 --> 00:06:59.264
at Boston Children's.

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:01.781
I want to use this case
that we recently built.

00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:06.575
It's the case of a four-year-old
who had a progressively enlarging head,

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.876
and as a result,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.032
had loss of developmental milestones,
neurologic milestones,

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.073
and the reason for this problem is here --

00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:15.747
it's called hydrocephalus.

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:19.243
So, a quick study in neurosurgery.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:20.432
There's the brain,

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:23.004
and you can see the cranium
surrounding the brain.

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.813
What surrounds the brain,
between the brain and cranium,

00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:30.055
is something called
cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.813
which acts as a shock absorber.

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:33.728
In your heads right now,

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:37.009
there is cerebrospinal fluid
just bathing your brains

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:38.859
and making its way around.

00:07:38.883 --> 00:07:41.509
It's produced in one area
and flows through,

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:42.824
and then is re-exchanged.

00:07:42.848 --> 00:07:45.745
And this beautiful flow pattern
occurs for all of us.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.310
But unfortunately in some children,

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.837
there's a blockage of this flow pattern,

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:52.413
much like a traffic jam.

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.708
As a result, the fluid accumulates,

00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:58.248
and the brain is pushed aside.

00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:00.784
It has difficulty growing.

00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:04.914
As a result, the child loses
neurologic milestones.

00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:07.349
This is a devastating disease in children.

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:11.867
The cure for this is surgery.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.801
The traditional surgery is to take
a bit of the cranium off,

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:15.983
a bit of the skull,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:18.950
drain this fluid out,
stick a drain in place,

00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.702
and then eventually bring
this drain internal to the body.

00:08:21.726 --> 00:08:22.942
Big operation.

00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:28.233
But some great news is that advances
in neurosurgical care

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:31.966
have allowed us to develop
minimally invasive approaches

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.150
to this surgery.

00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:37.499
Through a small pinhole,
a camera can be inserted,

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:41.480
led into the deep brain structure,

00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:45.457
and cause a little hole in a membrane
that allows all that fluid to drain,

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:47.529
much like it would in a sink.

00:08:47.553 --> 00:08:50.668
All of a sudden, the brain
is no longer under pressure,

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:52.149
can re-expand

00:08:52.173 --> 00:08:55.052
and we cure the child
through a single-hole incision.

00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:57.893
But here's the problem:

00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:00.061
hydrocephalus is relatively rare.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.140
And there are no good training methods

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:06.788
to get really good at getting
this scope to the right place.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:11.126
But surgeons have been quite creative
about this, even our own.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.158
And they've come up with training models.

00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:14.907
Here's the current training model.

00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:16.889
(Laughter)

00:09:16.913 --> 00:09:18.570
I kid you not.

00:09:18.594 --> 00:09:21.033
This is a red pepper,
not made in Hollywood;

00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:22.385
it's real red pepper.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.767
And what surgeons do is they stick
a scope into the pepper,

00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:28.889
and they do what is called a "seedectomy."

00:09:28.913 --> 00:09:30.680
(Laughter)

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:36.804
They use this scope to remove seeds
using a little tweezer.

00:09:37.632 --> 00:09:40.260
And that is a way to get under their belts

00:09:40.284 --> 00:09:43.280
the rudimentary components
of doing this surgery.

00:09:43.936 --> 00:09:46.372
Then they head right into
the apprenticeship model,

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:49.268
seeing many of them
as they present themselves,

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:51.555
then doing it, and then teaching it --

00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:53.596
waiting for these patients to arrive.

00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:55.886
We can do a lot better.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.637
We are manufacturing
reproductions of children

00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:04.567
in order for surgeons and surgical
teams to rehearse

00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:06.971
in the most relevant possible ways.

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:08.370
Let me show you this.

00:10:08.966 --> 00:10:10.474
Here's my team

00:10:10.498 --> 00:10:14.403
in what's called the SIM Engineering
Division of the Simulator Program.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.983
This is an amazing team of individuals.

00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:20.282
They are mechanical engineers;

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.731
you're seeing here, illustrators.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:27.327
They take primary data
from CT scans and MRIs,

00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:30.681
translate it into digital information,

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:32.011
animate it,

00:10:32.035 --> 00:10:36.826
put it together into the components
of the child itself,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.644
surface-scan elements of the child
that have been casted as needed,

00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:43.253
depending on the surgery itself,

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:47.168
and then take this digital data
and be able to output it

00:10:47.192 --> 00:10:50.940
on state-of-the-art,
three-dimensional printing devices

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:53.234
that allow us to print the components

00:10:53.258 --> 00:10:58.926
exactly to the micron detail of what
the child's anatomy will look like.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.254
You can see here,

00:11:00.278 --> 00:11:02.712
the skull of this child being printed

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:05.222
in the hours before
we performed this surgery.

00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:09.014
But we could not do this work

00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:13.425
without our dear friends on the West Coast
in Hollywood, California.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.830
These are individuals
that are incredibly talented

00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:20.278
at being able to recreate reality.

00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:24.726
It was not a long leap for us.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.326
The more we got into this field,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.110
the more it became clear to us
that we are doing cinematography.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.687
We're doing filmmaking,

00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:34.935
it's just that the actors are not actors.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:38.225
They're real doctors and nurses.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.389
So these are some photos
of our dear friends at Fractured FX

00:11:42.413 --> 00:11:43.882
in Hollywood California,

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:47.480
an Emmy-Award-winning
special effects firm.

00:11:47.504 --> 00:11:50.674
This is Justin Raleigh and his group --

00:11:50.698 --> 00:11:52.346
this is not one of our patients --

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.728
(Laughter)

00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:56.820
but kind of the exquisite work
that these individuals do.

00:11:56.844 --> 00:12:00.448
We have now collaborated
and fused our experience,

00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:02.878
bringing their group
to Boston Children's Hospital,

00:12:02.902 --> 00:12:05.558
sending our group
out to Hollywood, California

00:12:05.582 --> 00:12:06.951
and exchanging around this

00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:09.978
to be able to develop
these type of simulators.

00:12:10.002 --> 00:12:14.471
What I'm about to show you
is a reproduction of this child.

00:12:18.992 --> 00:12:24.120
You'll notice here that every hair
on the child's head is reproduced.

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:27.847
And in fact, this is also
that reproduced child --

00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.064
and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,

00:12:31.088 --> 00:12:33.948
but that is a reproduction and simulation

00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:36.066
of the child they're about to operate on.

00:12:38.313 --> 00:12:40.751
Here's that membrane we had talked about,

00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:42.934
the inside of this child's brain.

00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:48.326
What you're going to be seeing here
is, on one side, the actual patient,

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.629
and on the other side, the simulator.

00:12:50.653 --> 00:12:55.003
As I mentioned, a scope, a little camera,
needs to make its way down,

00:12:55.027 --> 00:12:56.428
and you're seeing that here.

00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:58.776
It needs to make a small hole
in this membrane

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.509
and allow this fluid to seep out.

00:13:02.975 --> 00:13:07.616
I won't do a quiz show to see
who thinks which side is which,

00:13:08.782 --> 00:13:11.086
but on the right is the simulator.

00:13:12.503 --> 00:13:16.301
So surgeons can now produce
training opportunities,

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:19.378
do these surgeries
as many times as they want,

00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:22.244
to their heart's content,
until they feel comfortable.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:25.833
And then, and only then,
bring the child into the operating room.

00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:27.026
But we don't stop here.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.360
We know that a key step to this
is not just the skill itself,

00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:35.915
but combining that skill with a team
who's going to deliver that care.

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:38.281
Now we turn to Formula One.

00:13:38.845 --> 00:13:42.095
And here is an example
of a technician putting on a tire

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:45.328
and doing that time and time
again on this car.

00:13:45.352 --> 00:13:48.337
But that is very quickly
going to be incorporated

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.292
within team-training experiences,

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:54.525
now as a full team orchestrating
the exchange of tires

00:13:54.549 --> 00:13:57.547
and getting this car back on the speedway.

00:13:58.094 --> 00:14:01.371
We've done that step in health care,

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:05.517
so now what you're about to see
is a simulated operation.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.967
We've taken the simulator
I just described to you,

00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:12.392
we've brought it into the operating room
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:16.071
and these individuals --
these native teams, operative teams --

00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:19.618
are doing the surgery before the surgery.

00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:21.379
Operate twice;

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.609
cut once.

00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:24.335
Let me show that to you.

00:14:25.237 --> 00:14:28.350
(Video) Surgical team member 1:
You want the head down or head up?

00:14:28.374 --> 00:14:30.078
STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:32.751
STM 3: And then lower
the whole table down a little bit?

00:14:32.775 --> 00:14:34.029
STM 4: Table coming down.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:39.381
STM 3: All right, this
is behaving like a vessel.

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:41.492
Could we have the scissors back, please?

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:44.817
STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,
8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.

00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:47.242
STM 6: Great! Thank you.

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:49.989
Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.

00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:52.105
The second step to this,
which is critical,

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:55.228
is we take these teams out
immediately and debrief them.

00:14:55.252 --> 00:14:56.716
We use the same technologies

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.428
that are used in Lean
and Six Sigma in the military,

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:04.537
and we bring them out
and talk about what went right,

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:06.206
but more importantly,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.697
we talk about what didn't go well,

00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.656
and how we're going to fix it.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.434
Then we bring them right back in
and do it again.

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:18.649
Deliberative batting practice
in the moments when it matters most.

00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:22.280
Let's go back to this case now.

00:15:22.903 --> 00:15:24.280
Same child,

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:26.694
but now let me describe
how we care for this child

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.181
at Boston Children's Hospital.

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.691
This child was born
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:32.722
At two o'clock in the morning,

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.872
we assembled the team,

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:36.697
and took the reproduced anatomy

00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:40.426
that we would gain
out of scans and images,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.216
and brought that team
to the virtual bedside,

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.827
to a simulated bedside --

00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:48.392
the same team that's going to operate
on this child in the hours ahead --

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:50.799
and we have them do the procedure.

00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.091
Let me show you a moment of this.

00:15:54.032 --> 00:15:56.192
This is not a real incision.

00:15:57.271 --> 00:15:59.471
And the baby has not yet been born.

00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:02.301
Imagine this.

00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:07.841
So now the conversations
that I have with families

00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:10.565
in the intensive care unit
at Boston Children's Hospital

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:11.977
are totally different.

00:16:12.582 --> 00:16:14.318
Imagine this conversation:

00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:20.320
"Not only do we take care of this disorder
frequently in our ICU,

00:16:20.344 --> 00:16:22.522
and not only have we done surgeries

00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:24.981
like the surgery we're going
to do on your child,

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:28.719
but we have done your child's surgery.

00:16:29.776 --> 00:16:32.306
And we did it two hours ago.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.062
And we did it 10 times.

00:16:35.086 --> 00:16:38.907
And now we're prepared to take them
back to the operating room."

00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:42.881
So a new technology in health care:

00:16:43.987 --> 00:16:46.855
lifelike rehearsal.

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:50.433
Practicing prior to game time.

00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:52.632
Thank you.

00:16:52.656 --> 00:16:57.321
(Applause)
