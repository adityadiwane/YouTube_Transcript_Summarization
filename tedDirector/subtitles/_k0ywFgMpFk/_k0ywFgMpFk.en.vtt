00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:18.526
Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:22.992
and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:27.152
So I use my imagination as my full-time job.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.481
But well before my imagination was my vocation,

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.209
my imagination saved my life.

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:35.696
When I was a kid, I loved to draw,

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:38.562
and the most talented artist I knew

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:40.396
was my mother,

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:43.712
but my mother was addicted to heroin.

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:47.157
And when your parent is a drug addict,

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.496
it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.992
because as much as you want to love on that person,

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.230
as much as you want to receive love from that person,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.483
every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:02.703
So throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.129
and I didn't have my father because

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.789
I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.109
But I had my grandparents,

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.680
my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.962
who adopted me just before my third birthday

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:17.424
and took me in as their own,

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.352
after they had already raised five children.

00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:22.562
So two people who grew up in the Great Depression,

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:27.600
there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.658
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:31.764
of the Krosoczka family,

00:01:31.764 --> 00:01:34.345
the new kid who came out of nowhere.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:38.488
And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.

00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:41.581
They each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.784
and by the time I was six,

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.887
I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,

00:01:45.887 --> 00:01:48.040
dry with a twist, rocks on the side,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.021
the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.360
But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.720
And they supported my creative efforts,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.209
because my grandfather was a self-made man.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.929
He ran and worked in a factory.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.392
My grandmother was a homemaker.

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:06.970
But here was this kid who loved Transformers

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.111
and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:15.912
and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:18.987
and they became my friends.

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:21.289
So my best friends in life were the characters

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.760
I read about in books.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.847
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:29.543
and I had wonderful teachers there,

00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:32.944
most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:36.703
And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered

00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:39.450
us as her students.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.349
When I was in the third grade,

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.092
a monumental event happened.

00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:46.436
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:49.876
A published author of books came to talk to us

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.374
about what he did for a living.

00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:55.748
And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.322
and we drew our own renditions of his main character,

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.771
Rotten Ralph.

00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.628
And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:05.580
and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.200
going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.397
But he stopped next to my desk,

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:14.897
and he tapped on my desk, and he said,

00:03:14.897 --> 00:03:17.251
"Nice cat." (Laughter)

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.990
And he wandered away.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.326
Two words that made a colossal difference in my life.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:28.165
When I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:31.847
"The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer." (Laughter)

00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:34.132
We had to write our own Greek myth,

00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:36.975
our own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:40.918
who challenged Hermes to a flying race,

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:43.029
and the owl cheated,

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.751
and Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,

00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.620
and turned the owl into a moon,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.559
so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.602
while he watched his family and friends play at night.

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:57.014
Yeah. (Laughter)

00:03:57.014 --> 00:03:59.166
My book had a title page.

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:03.468
I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:06.599
(Laughter)

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.846
And it was a story that was told with words and pictures,

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:12.034
exactly what I do now for a living,

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:15.721
and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.791
and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.026
to tell the story.

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.372
My favorite page is the "About the author" page.

00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:26.611
(Laughter)

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:29.454
So I learned to write about myself in third person

00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:32.574
at a young age.

00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:36.098
So I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:40.029
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.214
and that's what writing is.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.729
Writing is using your imagination on paper,

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.700
and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.757
and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:53.571
that writing would be using your imagination on paper,

00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:57.650
if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.838
So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,

00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:02.333
and I would take out pieces of paper,

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.254
and I would staple them together,

00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:07.094
and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:10.770
just because I loved using my imagination.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.882
And so these characters would become my friends.

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:15.942
There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,

00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:18.416
and they all lived in this refrigerator city,

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:21.238
and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.641
that was filled with so many dangers

00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:27.325
like an evil blender who tried to chop them up,

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:33.267
an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.622
and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend

00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:39.019
who was a stick of butter. (Laughter)

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:41.222
And I'd make my own comics too,

00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:43.359
and this was another way for me to tell stories,

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:46.590
through words and through pictures.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.374
Now when I was in sixth grade,

00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:51.230
the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.274
in the Worcester public school system.

00:05:53.274 --> 00:05:56.658
I went from having art once a week

00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:58.255
to twice a month

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:01.101
to once a month to not at all.

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.973
And my grandfather, he was a wise man,

00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:04.808
and he saw that as a problem, because he knew

00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:08.388
that was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.170
I had art.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.628
So he walked into my room one evening,

00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:15.173
and he sat on the edge of my bed,

00:06:15.173 --> 00:06:17.412
and he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,

00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:19.901
we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:21.498
And I was so thrilled.

00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:23.168
So from sixth through 12th grade,

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:25.169
once, twice, sometimes three times a week,

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.888
I would take classes at the art museum,

00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:29.920
and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.324
other kids who shared a similar passion.

00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:36.283
Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover

00:06:36.283 --> 00:06:38.894
for my eighth grade yearbook,

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:42.161
and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,

00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:44.769
I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:48.630
and Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.523
And to this day, I still can do karaoke to "Ice, Ice Baby"

00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:55.066
without looking at the screen.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:58.576
Don't tempt me, because I will do it.

00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:00.498
So I get shipped off to private school,

00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:02.721
K through eight, public schools, but for some reason

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.096
my grandfather was upset that somebody

00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:07.457
at the local high school had been stabbed and killed,

00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:10.153
so he didn't want me to go there.

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.964
He wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.

00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:14.700
You can go to Holy Name, which is coed,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.073
or St. John's, which is all boys.

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:19.273
Very wise man, because he knew I would,

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:22.009
I felt like I was making the decision on my own,

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.805
and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:25.503
so I went to Holy Name High School,

00:07:25.503 --> 00:07:28.271
which was a tough transition because, like I said,

00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:29.831
I didn't play sports,

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:32.312
and it was very focused on sports,

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:36.476
but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:38.974
And I just flourished here.

00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:42.133
I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.420
So how did I make friends?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.653
I drew funny pictures of my teachers -- (Laughter) --

00:07:48.653 --> 00:07:51.410
and I passed them around.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.208
Well, in English class, in ninth grade,

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.184
my friend John, who was sitting next to me,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:07:59.899
laughed a little bit too hard.

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:02.180
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.087
(Laughter)

00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:09.472
He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:13.487
and for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,

00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:15.669
and I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:18.874
My grandfather's just going to kill me."

00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:20.435
And he came out to the hallway and he said,

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:21.553
"Let me see the paper."

00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:26.617
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:29.453
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:32.666
And we sat in silence for that brief moment,

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:34.814
and he said to me,

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:38.177
"You're really talented." (Laughter)

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:40.866
"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:43.249
needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.

00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:46.875
Just stop drawing in my class."

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:49.209
So my parents never found out about it.

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:52.435
I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.099
who ran the school newspaper,

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:58.671
and I was for three and a half years

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:01.047
the cartoonist for my school paper,

00:09:01.047 --> 00:09:03.219
handling such heavy issues as,

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:06.327
seniors are mean,

00:09:06.327 --> 00:09:08.923
freshmen are nerds,

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:14.728
the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.

00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:18.312
And I took the headmaster to task

00:09:18.312 --> 00:09:22.175
and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.421
who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down

00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:27.537
that this wasn't about me,

00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:31.339
but all these years later it was totally me.

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:33.467
But it was so cool because I could write these stories,

00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:34.645
I could come up with these ideas,

00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:36.948
and they'd be published in the school paper,

00:09:36.948 --> 00:09:39.558
and people who I didn't know could read them.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.613
And I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas

00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:44.943
through the printed page.

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.139
On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:50.384
gave me the best birthday present ever:

00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:55.303
a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.559
Here I am, 20 years later,

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:01.103
and I still work on this table every day.

00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:03.513
On the evening of my 14th birthday,

00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:07.678
I was given this table, and we had Chinese food.

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:11.298
And this was my fortune:

00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:13.575
"You will be successful in your work."

00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:16.403
I taped it to the top left hand of my table,

00:10:16.403 --> 00:10:18.362
and as you can see, it's still there.

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:22.263
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything.

00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:24.607
Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster

00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:28.743
and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.

00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:31.562
(Laughter)

00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:34.759
And a video camera.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.999
I just wanted a video camera.

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:39.480
And after begging and pleading for Christmas,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.911
I got a second-hand video camera,

00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:45.743
and I instantly started making my own animations

00:10:45.743 --> 00:10:47.943
on my own,

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:50.623
and all throughout high school I made my own animations.

00:10:50.623 --> 00:10:53.720
I convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.047
to do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"

00:10:56.047 --> 00:11:00.811
as an animated short. (Laughter)

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.667
And I kept making comics.

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:07.611
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,

00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:11.844
I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.

00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:14.733
Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:16.948
and he's still a dear friend of mine,

00:11:16.948 --> 00:11:19.355
and I was 14 or 15,

00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:22.376
and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:24.190
and I was so excited, I was beaming.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.491
I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,

00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.796
and it taught me how to draw superheroes,

00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:32.124
how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.050
just the way they were supposed to be

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.875
if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:39.767
And all the color just drained from his face,

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:41.506
and he looked at me, and he said,

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:44.276
"Forget everything you learned."

00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:48.100
And I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.262
Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.

00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.420
Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.869
because you're really good."

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:00.443
Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,

00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:03.956
but after 17 years of having a mother

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:06.118
who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:10.019
and a father who was faceless, I was angry.

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.741
And when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,

00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:16.642
upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.

00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:18.562
And on the day I met my father for the first time,

00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:21.326
I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,

00:12:21.326 --> 00:12:25.077
my one and only choice for college.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.469
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine

00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:29.969
to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,

00:12:29.969 --> 00:12:33.041
kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.

00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:35.606
Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:38.171
and Eric lives with me every day.

00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.860
So after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.052
he brought in these picture books,

00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:44.902
and I thought, "Picture books for kids!"

00:12:44.902 --> 00:12:49.970
and I started writing books for young readers

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.699
when I was a senior in high school.

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:54.487
Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.

00:12:54.487 --> 00:12:56.591
I transferred to RISD as a sophomore,

00:12:56.591 --> 00:13:00.222
and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,

00:13:00.222 --> 00:13:04.255
and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug

00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:05.907
who wanted to be friends with this kid.

00:13:05.907 --> 00:13:07.416
The kid had no patience for him.

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:10.655
And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers

00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:13.199
and it was rejected every single time,

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:15.952
but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:18.937
an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,

00:13:18.937 --> 00:13:22.185
and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,

00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:25.952
and I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:29.688
I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,

00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:32.306
and I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.

00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:34.481
I set up a studio and I tried to get published.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.522
I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards

00:13:37.522 --> 00:13:39.919
to editors and art directors,

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:41.559
but they would go unanswered.

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.414
And my grandfather would call me every week,

00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:47.745
and he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"

00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:50.009
Because he had just invested a significant amount of money

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:51.930
in my college education.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.785
And I said, "Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."

00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:59.303
And he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"

00:13:59.303 --> 00:14:01.269
And I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:02.429
But I know it's going to happen."

00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:05.922
Now, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming

00:14:05.922 --> 00:14:09.105
to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:12.857
and this kid who was just this really hyper kid,

00:14:12.857 --> 00:14:15.729
I started calling him "Monkey Boy,"

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:19.410
and I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.692
And I sent out one last batch of postcards.

00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:26.066
And I received an email from an editor at Random House

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.817
with a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.

00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:31.605
"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.368
I liked your art, so I went to your website

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:38.329
and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:40.995
because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:45.066
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City."

00:14:45.066 --> 00:14:48.368
And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.

00:14:48.368 --> 00:14:50.704
So the next week I "happened" to be in New York.

00:14:50.704 --> 00:14:53.648
(Laughter)

00:14:53.648 --> 00:14:55.960
And I met with this editor,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.184
and I left New York for a contract for my first book,

00:14:59.184 --> 00:15:00.217
"Good Night, Monkey Boy,"

00:15:00.217 --> 00:15:03.679
which was published on June 12, 2001.

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:09.374
And my local paper celebrated the news.

00:15:09.374 --> 00:15:13.639
The local bookstore made a big deal of it.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.528
They sold out of all of their books.

00:15:15.528 --> 00:15:19.305
My friend described it as a wake, but happy,

00:15:19.305 --> 00:15:21.882
because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,

00:15:21.882 --> 00:15:24.906
but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:26.453
My grandparents, they were in the middle of it.

00:15:26.453 --> 00:15:29.042
They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.

00:15:29.042 --> 00:15:32.794
Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.

00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:34.233
Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:37.490
"I taught him how to read." (Laughter)

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.034
And then something happened that changed my life.

00:15:40.034 --> 00:15:42.250
I got my first piece of significant fan mail,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.525
where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:49.121
that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:53.508
For a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)

00:15:53.508 --> 00:15:56.569
You know? You only get one birthday per year.

00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:59.414
And for him, it's only his second.

00:15:59.414 --> 00:16:00.420
And I got this picture, and I thought,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.462
"This picture is going to live within his consciousness

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:06.138
for his entire life. He will forever have this photo

00:16:06.138 --> 00:16:09.094
in his family photo albums."

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.762
So that photo, since that moment,

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:14.809
is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.

00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:17.369
I have 10 picture books out.

00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:20.769
"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:23.053
I just finished the ninth book

00:16:23.053 --> 00:16:25.546
in the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series

00:16:25.546 --> 00:16:28.130
about a lunch lady who fights crime.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.946
I'm expecting the release of a chapter book

00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:34.626
called "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:38.196
And I travel the country visiting countless schools,

00:16:38.196 --> 00:16:42.706
letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.

00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:45.234
And I meet Bagheads.

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:49.805
Lunch ladies treat me really well.

00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:54.329
And I got to see my name in lights

00:16:54.329 --> 00:16:56.179
because kids put my name in lights.

00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:58.269
Twice now, the "Lunch Lady" series has won

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:01.250
the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.220
and those winners were displayed

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.480
on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.204
"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies,

00:17:10.204 --> 00:17:12.778
so I am a movie producer

00:17:12.778 --> 00:17:15.511
and I really do think, thanks to that video camera

00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:18.075
I was given in ninth grade.

00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:20.845
I've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties,

00:17:20.845 --> 00:17:23.732
people have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween,

00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:25.361
a "Punk Farm" baby room,

00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:30.176
which makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.

00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:32.647
And I get the most amazing fan mail,

00:17:32.647 --> 00:17:35.055
and I get the most amazing projects,

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:38.407
and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.

00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:40.561
The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:44.718
dressed as my character. It was so cool.

00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:47.832
Now my grandparents are no longer living,

00:17:47.832 --> 00:17:50.896
so to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum

00:17:50.896 --> 00:17:54.171
for kids who are in difficult situations

00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:56.879
but whose caretakers can't afford the classes.

00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:59.470
And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.566
and you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:04.253
I said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"

00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:07.359
And she responded with, "I'm here." (Laughter)

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:13.973
That's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.

00:18:13.973 --> 00:18:15.649
So the biggest moment for me, though,

00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:17.635
my most important job now is I am a dad myself,

00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:19.983
and I have two beautiful daughters,

00:18:19.983 --> 00:18:22.774
and my goal is to surround them by inspiration,

00:18:22.774 --> 00:18:25.896
by the books that are in every single room of our house

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:28.486
to the murals I painted in their rooms

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:32.125
to the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:35.610
by making faces on the patio

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.934
to letting her sit in the very desk

00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:40.622
that I've sat in for the past 20 years.

00:18:40.622 --> 00:18:42.898
Thank you. (Applause)
