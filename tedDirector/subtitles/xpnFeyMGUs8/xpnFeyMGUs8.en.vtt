00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's talk about billions.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Let's talk about

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
past and future billions.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
We know

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that about 106 billion people

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
have ever lived.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And we know that most of them are dead.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And we also know

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that most of them live or lived in Asia.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And we also know

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
that most of them were or are very poor --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
did not live for very long.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Let's talk about billions.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Let's talk about

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
in the world today.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
We know that most of that wealth

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
was made after the year 1800.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And we know that most of it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is currently owned

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
by people we might call Westerners:

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
19 percent of the world's population today,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Economic historians

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
call this "The Great Divergence."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And this slide here

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
is the best simplification

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
of the Great Divergence story

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
I can offer you.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
It's basically two ratios

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
of per capita GDP,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
per capita gross domestic product,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
so average income.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
One, the red line,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
is the ratio of British to Indian

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
per capita income.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And the blue line

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
is the ratio of American to Chinese.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And this chart goes back to 1500.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And you can see here

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that there's an exponential Great Divergence.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
They start off pretty close together.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
In fact, in 1500,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
When you get to the 1970s,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
which is where this chart ends,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
the average Briton is more than 10 times richer

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
than the average Indian.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And that's allowing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
for differences in the cost of living.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
It's based on purchasing power parity.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
The average American

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
is nearly 20 times richer

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
than the average Chinese

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
by the 1970s.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
So why?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
This wasn't just an economic story.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
If you take the 10 countries

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that went on to become

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
the Western empires,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
in 1500 they were really quite tiny --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
five percent of the world's land surface,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
16 percent of its population,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
maybe 20 percent of its income.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
By 1913,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
these 10 countries, plus the United States,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
controlled vast global empires --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
58 percent of the world's territory,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
about the same percentage of its population,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
of global economic output.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And notice, most of that went to the motherland,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
to the imperial metropoles,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
not to their colonial possessions.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
though many people have tried to do so --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
for two reasons.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
One, empire was the least original thing

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that the West did after 1500.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Everybody did empire.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
They beat preexisting Oriental empires

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
like the Mughals and the Ottomans.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
for the Great Divergence.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
In any case, as you may remember,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
some considerable time after decolonization.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
This is not a new question.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Samuel Johnson,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the great lexicographer,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
[posed] it through his character Rasselas

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
in his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
published in 1759.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
for trade or conquest,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
cannot the Asiaticks and Africans

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
invade their coasts,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
plant colonies in their ports,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and give laws to their natural princes?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
The same wind that carries them back

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
would bring us thither?"

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
That's a great question.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And you know what,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
it was also being asked at roughly the same time

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world --

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
like Ibrahim Muteferrika,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
an Ottoman official,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
the man who introduced printing, very belatedly,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to the Ottoman Empire --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
who said in a book published in 1731,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
compared with Muslim nations

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260
begin to dominate so many lands in modern times

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Unlike Rasselas,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Muteferrika had an answer to that question,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
which was correct.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
He said it was "because they have laws and rules

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
invented by reason."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It's not geography.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
You may think we can explain the Great Divergence

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
in terms of geography.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
We know that's wrong,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to see if geography mattered more than institutions.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We took all the Germans,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
we divided them roughly in two,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and we gave the ones in the East communism,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and you see the result.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Within an incredibly short period of time,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
people living in the German Democratic Republic

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
produced Trabants, the Trabbi,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
one of the world's worst ever cars,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
If you still don't believe me,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And we decided we'd take Koreans

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
in roughly the same geographical place

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
with, notice, the same basic traditional culture,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And the result is an even bigger divergence

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
in a very short space of time

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
than happened in Germany.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
but in almost every other respect,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
it's a huge divergence.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Which leads me to think

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that neither geography nor national character,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
popular explanations for this kind of thing,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
are really significant.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It's the ideas.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
It's the institutions.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
This must be true

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
because a Scotsman said it.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So let me just explain to you

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
He was Adam Smith --

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
though he is very smart indeed.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
(Laughter)

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Smith -- and I want you to go

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
it's a wonderful statue --

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations"

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
published in 1776 --

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
that's the most important thing that happened that year ...

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
(Laughter)

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
You bet.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
(Laughter)

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
"China seems to have been long stationary,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But this complement may be much inferior

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
to what, with other laws and institutions,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the nature of its soil, climate, and situation

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
might admit of."

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
That is so right and so cool.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And he said it such a long time ago.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
But you know, this is a TED audience,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and if I keep talking about institutions,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
you're going to turn off.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Let's call them the killer apps.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that set the West apart from the rest.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
in the sense that they look quite simple.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
They're just icons; you click on them.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
But behind the icon, there's complex code.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
It's the same with institutions.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
There are six

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
which I think explain the Great Divergence.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
One, competition.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Two, the scientific revolution.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Three, property rights.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Four, modern medicine.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Five, the consumer society.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And six, the work ethic.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
or try and boil it down to just four,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
but you'll lose.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
(Laughter)

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
synthesizing the work of many economic historians

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in the process.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Competition means,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
but within each of these units,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
existed in the 12th century.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Nothing like this existed in China,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
where there was one monolithic state

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
covering a fifth of humanity,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and anyone with any ambition

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
had to pass one standardized examination,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
which took three days and was very difficult

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and very complex Confucian essay writing.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
The scientific revolution was different

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in a number of crucial ways,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
the most important being

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that, through the experimental method,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
of Newtonian physics to ballistics.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Once you do that,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
your artillery becomes accurate.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Think of what that means.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
That really was a killer application.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Laughter)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
but there's no scientific revolution there.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
because it's considered blasphemous

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
to inquire into the mind of God.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
That's what makes the difference

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
between North America and South America.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
You could turn up in North America

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
having signed a deed of indenture

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
saying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
You just have to feed me."

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
That's the land grant

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
on the bottom half of the slide.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
That's not possible in Latin America

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
where land is held onto

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And you can see here the huge divergence

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
that happens in property ownership between North and South.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Most people in rural North America

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
owned some land by 1900.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Hardly anyone in South America did.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
That's another killer app.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Modern medicine in the late 19th century

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
began to make major breakthroughs

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And this was another killer app --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
the very opposite of a killer,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
It even did that

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
in the European empires.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Even in places like Senegal,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
beginning in the early 20th century,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
there were major breakthroughs in public health,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and life expectancy began to rise.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
It doesn't rise any faster

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
after these countries become independent.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
The empires weren't all bad.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
The consumer society is what you need

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
for the Industrial Revolution to have a point.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
I guarantee it.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
That's the consumer society,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and it propels economic growth

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
more than even technological change itself.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Japan was the first non-Western society

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
to embrace it.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
The alternative,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Very few Indians today

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
wish that India had gone down

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Mahatma Gandhi's road.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Finally, the work ethic.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
He was wrong.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Any culture can get the work ethic

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
if the institutions are there

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
to create the incentive to work.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
We know this

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
because today the work ethic

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Today, the average Korean

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.260
works a thousand hours more a year

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
than the average German --

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
a thousand.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And this is part

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
of a really extraordinary phenomenon,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and that is the end of the Great Divergence.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Who's got the work ethic now?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Take a look at mathematical attainment

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
by 15 year-olds.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
At the top of the international league table

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
according to the latest PISA study,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
is the Shanghai district of China.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
The gap between Shanghai

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and the United Kingdom and the United States

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and Albania and Tunisia.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
You probably assume

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
that because the iPhone was designed in California

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
but assembled in China

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
You're wrong.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
In terms of patents,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
there's no question that the East is ahead.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
South Korea has gone into third place,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and China is just about to overtake Germany.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Why?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Because the killer apps can be downloaded.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
It's open source.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Any society can adopt these institutions,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and when they do,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.260
they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
only faster.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
This is the Great Reconvergence,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Because it's on your watch that this is happening.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
It's our generation

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
that is witnessing the end of Western predominance.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
than the average Chinese.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Now it's just five times,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and soon it will be 2.5 times.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So I want to end with three questions

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
for the future billions,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
just ahead of 2016,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
when the United States will lose its place

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
as number one economy to China.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.260
The first is, can you delete these apps,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and are we in the process of doing so

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
in the Western world?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
The second question is,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.260
does the sequencing of the download matter?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
One obvious implication of modern economic history

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
before you've established

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
secure private property rights.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Warning: that may not work.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And third, can China do without

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
killer app number three?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.260
That's the one that John Locke systematized

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.260
when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
and the protection of law.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
That's the basis

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
for the Western model

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
of representative government.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Now this picture shows the demolition

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
in Shanghai earlier this year.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
He's now free again,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
having been detained, as you know, for some time.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Winston Churchill once defined civilization

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.260
in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And I think these words really nail it:

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
give place to parliaments where laws are made,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and independent courts of justice

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
in which over long periods those laws are maintained.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
That is civilization --

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
and in its soil grow continually

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
freedom, comfort and culture,"

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.260
what all TEDsters care about most.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
"When civilization reigns in any country,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
a wider and less harassed life

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
is afforded to the masses of the people."

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
That's so true.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
I don't think the decline of Western civilization

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
is inevitable,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
because I don't think history operates

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
in this kind of life-cycle model,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
"Course of Empire" paintings.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
That's not the way history works.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
That's not the way the West rose,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
The West may collapse very suddenly.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
Complex civilizations do that,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
because they operate, most of the time,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
on the edge of chaos.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
That's one of the most profound insights

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
to come out of the historical study of complex institutions

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
like civilizations.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
No, we may hang on,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.260
despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and other parts of our historical mojo.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
But one thing is for sure,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
the Great Divergence

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
is over, folks.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
Thanks very much.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:18:15.260
(Applause)

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
Bruno Giussani: Niall,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
I am just curious

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
about your take on the other region of the world that's booming,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
which is Latin America.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
What's your view on that?

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
about the rise of the East;

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
and that includes South America.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
"Hey, is South America part of the West?"

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
He was an expert in Latin American history.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
That tells you something really important.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
but also Chile,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
which was in many ways the one that led the way

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.260
in transforming the institutions of economic life,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
there's a very bright future indeed.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
So my story really is

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
as much about that convergence in the Americas

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
as it's a convergence story in Eurasia.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
BG: And there is this impression

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
that North America and Europe

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
are not really paying attention

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
to these trends.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260
Mostly they're worried about each other.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
And that's all we seem to be caring about recently.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
NF: I think the fiscal crisis

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
that we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
is essentially the same thing

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
taking different forms

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
in terms of political culture.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.260
And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
it's partly to do with demographics.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.260
But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisis

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
that followed excessive leverage,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
excessive borrowing in the private sector.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
That crisis,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.260
which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.260
I think is an epiphenomenon.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.260
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
which has just accelerated

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.260
this huge shift,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.260
which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
I think that's its real importance.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.)

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.260
(Applause)
