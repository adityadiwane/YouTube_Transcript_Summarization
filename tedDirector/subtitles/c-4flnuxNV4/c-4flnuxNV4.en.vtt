00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
We all make decisions every day; we want to know

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
exactly the right thing at all possible times,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
that would be a tremendous gift.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
and I also want to explain to you why it is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
The expected value of any of our actions --

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
is the product of two simple things:

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
and the value of that gain to us.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
we will always know precisely how we should behave.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.330
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
that multiplies to five, and that's more

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.330
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.330
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
what the right thing is to do, and those are

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Now, let me talk about the first one first.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.330
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.330
or of flipping a heads.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
I should say, lose more -- gambling

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.330
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.330
The way people figure odds

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
observed in any particular day in Oxford.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
you quickly reviewed in memory the times

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
then dogs on leashes are more probable.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.330
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Are there more four-letter English words

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
with R in the third place or R in the first place?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.330
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
with R in the third than the first place.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.330
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.330
It's like the dictionary;

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
So, this is an example of how this idea that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
the quickness with which things come to mind

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
can give you a sense of their probability --

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
these are estimates of number of deaths per year

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
per 200 million U.S. citizens.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
Compare these to the actual numbers.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.330
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
Two things are vastly underestimated:

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
It's not interesting because it's so common.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.330
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
we vastly underestimate them.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.330
is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
of all three of the others that you see on the slide.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
of people's ability to compute probabilities.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.330
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
by investing your money in a lottery ticket

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.330
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
with everybody who lost?

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
Indeed, if we required that television stations run

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
a 30-second interview with each loser

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
of your undivided attention just to watch them say,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.330
no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery:

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
imagine that the nine tickets are all owned

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
by one fat guy named Leroy.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.330
but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
changes your decision to play,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.330
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
compared to trying to estimate value:

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
how much pleasure it will give us.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
I want to talk now about errors in value.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
you wouldn't pay that for it.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
What else can I do with 25 dollars?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.330
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
and realized that they're not going to serve you any food,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
is wafting over the seat, you think,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.330
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
before I'd even told you anything about the context?

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.330
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.330
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
And this is a systematic error people make.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.330
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
For example, this is, of course,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
is to say something used to be higher,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
When people are asked about these two different jobs:

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
they're all told they make much less money. Why?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.330
in the declining period. Here's another nice example.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.330
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
so you decide to mull it over for a week.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.330
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
for something that was 700 last week.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
This tendency to compare to the past

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
Here's another example of how comparing to the past

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.330
can befuddle our decisions.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
Imagine that you're going to the theater.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.330
You're on your way to the theater.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
You also have a 20-dollar bill.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
When you arrive at the theater,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
Most people answer, no.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.330
You're on your way to the theater,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
Now, just in case you're not getting it,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.330
(Laughter)

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Along the way, you lost something.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
What the hell difference should it make?

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.330
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
in people's attempts to assign value.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.330
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
One of the things we know about comparison:

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.330
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
didn't seem like such a great guy.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
(Laughter)

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.330
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
and they use this wisdom to help you --

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
spare you the undue burden of money.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.330
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.330
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Most people don't want the most expensive,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
they don't want the least expensive.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:43.330
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.330
So I'm telling you something you already knew:

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.330
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Here's why that's a problem:

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:55.330
the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.330
it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.330
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.330
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
our attempts to make rational decisions.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.330
Let me just give you an example.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.330
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
the simplest of all questions:

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.330
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.330
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.330
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
Namely, those who are looking at Spam

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty;

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
those who are looking at Godiva chocolate

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
think they won't be nearly so tasty.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.330
when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.330
what's sitting in the corner of the room

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.330
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
that then does not carry through and change their experience.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
You want to buy a car stereo.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.330
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
Most people say they would.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.330
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.330
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.330
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.330
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
doesn't know where it came from.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
It doesn't know what you saved it on.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.330
I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.330
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:40.330
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.330
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.330
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
to the purchase that you're making,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.330
but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
You've all had this experience.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.330
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
And at some point you may have met a couple

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.330
from your own hometown, and you thought,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.330
"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.330
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.330
and what do you find?

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.330
Compared to your regular friends,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.330
they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.330
the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.330
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.330
these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.330
and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.330
the big ones sound a little better.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
And so you buy them, and you bring them home,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
and you entirely violate the décor of your house.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.330
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
is a comparison you'll never make again.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.330
which you can't even remember hearing.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
when these choices are arrayed over time.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330
People have a lot of trouble making decisions

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.330
about things that will happen at different points in time.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.330
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.330
is that by and large people use two simple rules.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.330
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.330
and then a third, hard, problem.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
Here's the first easy problem:

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.330
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.330
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.330
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
we believe more is better than less.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.330
Here's the second problem:

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.330
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.330
Again, an easy decision,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.330
because we all know that now is better than later.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.330
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.330
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.330
by waiting, but you have to be patient.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.330
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.330
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.330
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.330
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.330
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.330
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.330
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.330
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.330
or 60 dollars in 13 months.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.330
What do we find now?

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.330
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.330
they might as well wait 13.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.330
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.330
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.330
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.330
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.330
than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.330
or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.330
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.330
off into the future a year.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.330
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.330
These guys can tell us.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
What you see here are two lads,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.330
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.330
and I want you to notice two things.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:38.330
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.330
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.330
then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.330
Here are the results of what I just showed you.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.330
This is the subjective height --

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.330
the height you saw of these guys at various points.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.330
And I want you to see that two things are true.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.330
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.330
and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:09.330
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.330
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.330
but at a far distance

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.330
their normal, their true, relations are preserved.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.330
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.330
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.330
60 now or 50 in a month?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.330
And these are subjective values,

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.330
and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.330
People always think more is better than less:

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.330
60 is always better than 50,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.330
and they always think now is better than later:

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.330
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.330
Watch what happens when we drop some out.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.330
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.330
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.330
over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.330
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.330
when people get to the future, they will change their minds.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.330
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.330
what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.330
I'll take the 50 dollars now.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.330
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this:

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.330
If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.330
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:26.330
of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.330
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.330
in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.330
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.330
than the one in which we are living.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.330
They were evolved for a world

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.330
in which people lived in very small groups,

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.330
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.330
had rather short lives in which there were few choices

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:51.330
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.330
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:01.330
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.330
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:10.330
why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.330
We are the only species on this planet

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.330
that has ever held its own fate in its hands.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.330
We have no significant predators,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.330
we're the masters of our physical environment;

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.330
the things that normally cause species to become extinct

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.330
are no longer any threat to us.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.330
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.330
are our own decisions.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.330
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.330
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.330
by a young Dutch fellow in 1738,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.330
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.330
and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.330
Thank you.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:24:03.330
(Applause)

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.330
Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:11.330
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.330
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.330
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:22.330
and is there some way that we could counteract that?

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.330
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.330
with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.330
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.330
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.330
based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.330
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.330
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.330
rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.330
stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:54.330
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.330
and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.330
We already know, for example, in the United States,

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.330
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.330
because they were scared -- and driving on highways,

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.330
than were killed in 9/11. OK?

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.330
If I told you that there was a plague

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.330
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.330
you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.330
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.330
whether they should get the kind of play,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.330
the kind of coverage, that they do.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.330
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.330
that they'll be hurt in these various ways,

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.330
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.330
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.330
that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.330
Talk more about it.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.330
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.330
If Australia disappears tomorrow,

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.330
terror is probably the right response.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:50.330
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.330
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.330
more people than that were killed

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.330
by not using their seatbelts in the same country.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.330
Is terror the right response?

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.330
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.330
that it's so spectacular?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.330
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.330
What is it?

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.330
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.330
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.330
it's not a tree falling on us by accident.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.330
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.330
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.330
as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.330
So there are a number of things that together

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.330
make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.330
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.330
they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.330
who want these things to be

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.330
as spectacular as they possibly can.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:49.330
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.330
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.330
go to Israel. And a mall blows up,

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.330
and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.330
at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.330
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.330
and the wedding that was planned was still going on.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.330
And as the Israeli mother said,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.330
she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.330
I mean, this is a society that has learned --

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.330
and there are others too -- that has learned to live

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:16.330
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.330
shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.330
CA: But is there a rational fear that actually,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.330
the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.330
the Big One is to come?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.330
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.330
there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.330
we would probably not be nearly so frightened.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.330
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.330
as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.330
That's not my point at all.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.330
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.330
our distress about things that happen, about threats,

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.330
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.330
and threats to come.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.330
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.330
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.330
how many people do you know got up and said,

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:06.330
Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.330
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.330
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.330
There are no guns going off.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.330
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.330
which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.330
(Laughter)

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.330
(Applause)

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.330
That's a tough one.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.330
CA: There's no question.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.330
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.330
unless someone can show that there's, you know,

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.330
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.330
The latest I've read, seen, thought

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.330
is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.330
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.330
but with poverty it's a bit --

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.330
DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.330
CA: We've evolved to get all excited

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.330
about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.330
in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.330
and systems that cause poverty and so forth,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.330
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.330
into worrying about those things?

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.330
People died; so be it.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.330
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.330
And so we evolved these responses.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.330
Is that what happened?

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.330
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.330
about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.330
are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.330
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.330
in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.330
an evolutionary explanation, you might say

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.330
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.330
of stuff that's new and different.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.330
And there's a good reason to be,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.330
because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.330
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.330
to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.330
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.330
our general tendency is to orient towards

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.330
that which is new and novel is activated.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.330
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.330
as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:06.330
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.330
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.330
you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.330
which is the error of value.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.330
I know, because I've interviewed

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.330
about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:21.330
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.330
That's what you think it is. All right?

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.330
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.330
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.330
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.330
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.330
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.330
releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.330
until the drawing indicates you've lost.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.330
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.330
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.330
down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.330
Now, economists tend to --

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.330
(Applause)

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.330
-- economists tend to view the world

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.330
through their own lenses, which is:

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.330
this is just a bunch of stupid people.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.330
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.330
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.330
we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:20.330
(Applause)

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.330
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.330
whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.330
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.330
people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.330
even though they don't feel great during the drawing.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.330
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.330
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.330
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.330
But certainly I see your point: that there can be

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.330
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.330
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.330
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.330
CA: Last question.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.330
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.330
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.330
I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.330
as we'll all hear tomorrow.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.330
I very much resonate with what you're saying,

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.330
because it seems to me that the problem

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.330
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.330
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.330
or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.330
(Laughter)

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.330
DG: For you or for them?

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.330
AdG: In persuading them.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.330
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.330
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.330
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.330
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.330
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.330
and the near future is that we imagine the near future

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.330
much more vividly than the far future.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.330
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.330
that people put into the mental representations

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.330
of near and far future, people begin to make decisions

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.330
about the two in the same way.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:02.330
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.330
is a question that's very different than,

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.330
imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.330
what will you look like, how much hair will you have,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.330
who will you be living with.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.330
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.330
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.330
so that that guy has a little retirement money.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.330
But these are tricks around the margins.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.330
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.330
which is to say, "I'm here today,

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.330
and so now is more important than later."

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.330
CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:31.330
that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.330
(Applause)
