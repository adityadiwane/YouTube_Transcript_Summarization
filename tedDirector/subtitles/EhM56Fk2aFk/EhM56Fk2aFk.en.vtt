00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
to some place so deep,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
so dark, so unexplored

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
It's a place of myth and legend.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It's a place marked on ancient maps

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
as "here be monsters."

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Instead, they just make me green with envy

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that my colleague from IUCN

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to actually take photographs

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
We are talking about the high seas.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The "high seas" is a legal term,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
With an average depth of the oceans

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
of 4,000 meters,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
in fact, the high seas covers and provides

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
nearly 90 percent of the habitat

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
for life on this Earth.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
It is, in theory, the global commons,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
belonging to us all.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But in reality,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
it is managed by and for

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
those who have the resources

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
to go out and exploit it.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to cast light on some of the outdated myths

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and legends and assumptions

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
that have kept us as the true stakeholders

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
in the high seas in the dark.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
We're going to voyage to some of these special places

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that we've been discovering in the past few years

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
to show why we really need to care.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And then finally, we're going to try

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to develop and pioneer a new perspective

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
on high seas governance

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
but framed in an arena of global norms

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
of precaution and respect.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So here is a picture of the high seas

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
as seen from above --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
that area in the darker blue.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
To me, as an international lawyer,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
this scared me far more

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
the global ocean,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that provides us all with carbon storage,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
with heat storage, with oxygen,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
if you can only protect 36 percent.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Some of the problems that we have to confront

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
are that the current international laws --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
for example, shipping --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
provide more protection

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to the areas closest to shore.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
For example, garbage discharge,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
something you would think just simply goes away,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
but the laws regulating

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
ship discharge of garbage

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
actually get weaker the further you are from shore.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
As a result, we have garbage patches

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the size of twice-Texas.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
It's unbelievable.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
We used to think the solution to pollution

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
was dilution,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
but that has proved to be no longer the case.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
So what we have learned from social scientists

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and economists like Elinor Ostrom,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
who are studying the phenomenon

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
of management of the commons on a local scale,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
is that there are certain prerequisites

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
that you can put into place

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that enable you to manage

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and access open space

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
for the good of one and all.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And these include a sense of shared responsibility,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
common norms that bind people together as a community.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Conditional access: You can invite people in,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
but they have to be able to play by the rules.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
you still need an effective system

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
of monitoring and enforcement,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
for as we've discovered,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
you can trust, but you also need to verify.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
What I'd also like to convey

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
is that it is not all doom and gloom

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that we are seeing in the high seas.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
For a group of very dedicated individuals --

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
scientists, conservationists,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
photographers and states --

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
were able to actually change a tragic trajectory

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that was destroying fragile seascapes

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
such as this coral garden

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that you see in front of you.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
That is, we're able to save it from a fate

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
of deep-sea bottom trawling.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And how did we do that?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and actually photographed the activities in process.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
But we also spent many hours

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
in the basements of the United Nations,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
trying to work with governments to make them understand

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
what was going on so far away from land

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that few of us had ever even imagined

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that these creatures existed.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So within three years,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
from 2003 to 2006,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
we were able to get norm in place

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that actually changed the paradigm

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
of how fishers went about

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
deep-sea bottom trawling.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
we actually created a regime

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
that required prior assessment of where you're going

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and a duty to prevent significant harm.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
they discovered

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
had been protected.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
This does not mean that it's the final solution,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
or that this even provides permanent protection.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But what it does mean

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
is that a group of individuals can form a community

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
to actually shape

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
the way high seas are governed,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
to create a new regime.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
for creating a true, blue perspective

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
for this beautiful planet.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Sylvia's wish

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
provides us with that leverage, that access

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
to the heart of human beings,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
you might say,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
but are now hopefully going to become interested

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
of some of these special areas,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
just to give you an idea of the flavor

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
of the riches and wonders they do contain.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
The Sargasso Sea, for example,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
is not a sea bounded by coastlines,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
but it is bounded by oceanic currents

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
that contain and envelope

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
this wealth of sargassum

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that grows and aggregates there.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
from Northern European

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and Northern American rivers

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
that are now so dwindling in numbers

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
But the Sargasso Sea,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
actually is pulling in the plastic

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
from throughout the region.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
This picture doesn't exactly show

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But there has just been a study

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that was released in February

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
that showed there are 200,000

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
pieces of plastic per square-kilometer

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and that is affecting the habitat

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
for the many species in their juvenile stages

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
who come to the Sargasso Sea

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
for its protection and its food.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
for the aggregation of these unique species

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It also provides a special habitat

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
for these flying fish to lay their eggs.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
But what I'd like to get from this picture

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
is that we truly do have an opportunity

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
to launch a global initiative for protection.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and its responsibility

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
as having some of the Sargasso Sea

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
within its national jurisdiction --

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
but the vast majority is beyond --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
to help spearhead a movement

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
to achieve protection for this vital area.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
It's actually a bay.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
It's considered high seas, because the continent

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
has been put off limits

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
to territorial claims.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
But what makes the Ross Sea important

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
is the vast sea of pack ice

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
that in the spring and summer

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
that supports what, till recently,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
has been a virtually intact

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
near-shore ecosystem.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But unfortunately, CCAMLR,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the regional commission

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and other living marine resources,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and has authorized the expansion

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
of toothfish fisheries in the region.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
The captain of a New Zealand vessel

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
who was just down there

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
is reporting a significant decline

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
as their main source of food.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
singly and together,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
to push governments,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to push regional fisheries management organizations,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
to declare our right

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
so that the freedom to fish no longer means

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
is a recently discovered area --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
There's enough food there to last them

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
the summer and the winter long.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
It's an oceanographic phenomenon

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
of these five Central American countries,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
but it moves with the season.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
As such, it does create a challenge to protect,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
We can use the same technologies that fishers use

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to identify where the species are,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
in order to close the area

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
when it's most vulnerable,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
which may, in some cases, be year-round.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Getting closer to shore, where we are,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Many species are headed through this region,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
which is why there's been so much attention

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
put into conservation

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
This is the initiative that's been coordinated

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
by Conservation International

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
with a variety of partners and governments

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
to actually try to bring integrated management regime

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
throughout the area.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
with a real regional initiative.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
does not recognize the need to protect areas

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
beyond national jurisdiction, at present.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
could not technically qualify

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
the time it's in the high seas.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
So what we've been suggesting

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
so that it can adopt

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
or we need to change the name

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.260
do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
where they spend most of their time

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and often end up getting hooked like this,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
or as bycatch.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
We need to work locally,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
We have the tools and technologies now

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to enable us to take a broader

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
ocean-basin-wide initiative.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
It's provided us data like this,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
of tiny, little sooty shearwaters

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that make the entire ocean basin their home.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
They fly 65,000 kilometers

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
in less than a year.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And its culminating year

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that's going to be launched in October.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So stay tuned for further information.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
What I find so exciting

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
is that the Census of Marine Life

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
where creatures like this flying sea cucumber

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
have been found.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
to team up with the Census of Marine Life

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and many of the scientists working there

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to actually try to translate

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
much of this information to policymakers.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We have the support of governments now behind us.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
to move ahead to protect some of these

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
significant hope spots, hotspots.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
At the same time we're saying,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
But many of you have said,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
if you get these marine protected areas,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
how are you going to enforce it?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
which is outer space technology.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
I wanted to be an astronaut,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
so I've constantly followed

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
what are the tools available to monitor Earth

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
from outer space --

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
in terms of being able to follow tagged species

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
throughout their life-cycles

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
in the open ocean.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Many already have transponders on board

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
But not all the vessels have those to date.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
It does not take too much rocket science

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to actually try to create new laws to mandate,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
if you're going to have the privilege

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
of accessing our high seas resources,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
we need to know -- someone needs to know --

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
where you are and what you're doing.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
So it brings me to my main take-home message,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
We can stop the collision course

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
of 50 percent of the planet

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
with the high seas.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
We need to change how we actually go about

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
managing these resources.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
We need to get the new paradigm

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
of precaution and respect.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
At the same time, we need to think locally,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
is that we can shine a spotlight

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
on many of these previously unknown areas,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and to bring people to the table, if you will,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
to actually make them feel part of this community

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
that truly has a stake

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
in their future management.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Many of the deep-sea communities

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
have genetic distribution

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
that goes ocean-basin-wide.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
We need to better understand,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
but we also need to start to manage and protect.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
And in order to do that,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
you also need ocean-basin management regimes.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
That is, we have regional management regimes

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
within the exclusive economic zone,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
so they're like the Southern Ocean,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
where they do have the two-pronged fisheries

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
and conservation organization.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Sylvia Earle for her wish,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
It's helping to bring an incredible group

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
of talented people together

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
to really try to solve and penetrate

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
these problems that have created our obstacles

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
to management and rational use

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.260
of this area that was once so far away and remote.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
So on this tour, I hope I provided you

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
with a new perspective of the high seas:

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
one, that it is our home too,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and that we need to work together

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Thank you.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
(Applause)
