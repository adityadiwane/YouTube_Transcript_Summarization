00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:17.637
In 1956, a documentary
by Jacques Cousteau won

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:20.662
both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.547
This film was called,
"Le Monde Du Silence,"

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.663
or, "The Silent World."

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:31.597
The premise of the title was that
the underwater world was a quiet world.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.594
We now know, 60 years later,

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:38.054
that the underwater world
is anything but silent.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:41.504
Although the sounds
are inaudible above water

00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:44.838
depending on where you are
and the time of year,

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:50.720
the underwater soundscape can be as noisy
as any jungle or rainforest.

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:56.469
Invertebrates like snapping shrimp,
fish and marine mammals

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:57.698
all use sound.

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.087
They use sound to study their habitat,

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.413
to keep in communication with each other,

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:04.720
to navigate,

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.953
to detect predators and prey.

00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:12.846
They also use sound by listening
to know something about their environment.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.549
Take, for an example, the Arctic.

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:18.801
It's considered a vast,
inhospitable place,

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:21.406
sometimes described as a desert,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.363
because it is so cold and so remote

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:26.598
and ice-covered for much of the year.

00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:28.801
And despite this,

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:32.869
there is no place on Earth
that I would rather be than the Arctic,

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:36.532
especially as days lengthen
and spring comes.

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:41.587
To me, the Arctic really
embodies this disconnect

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:46.867
between what we see on the surface
and what's going on underwater.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:52.511
You can look out across the ice --
all white and blue and cold --

00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:54.807
and see nothing.

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:58.110
But if you could hear underwater,

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:01.515
the sounds you would hear
would at first amaze

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.626
and then delight you.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.672
And while your eyes are seeing
nothing for kilometers but ice,

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:13.159
your ears are telling you that out there
are bowhead and beluga whales,

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:15.459
walrus and bearded seals.

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:18.390
The ice, too, makes sounds.

00:02:18.414 --> 00:02:21.898
It screeches and cracks
and pops and groans,

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:26.876
as it collides and rubs when temperature
or currents or winds change.

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:31.751
And under 100 percent sea ice
in the dead of winter,

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.911
bowhead whales are singing.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:37.934
And you would never expect that,

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.149
because we humans,

00:02:40.173 --> 00:02:42.770
we tend to be very visual animals.

00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:46.299
For most of us, but not all,

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:48.861
our sense of sight is how
we navigate our world.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:52.237
For marine mammals that live underwater,

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:56.124
where chemical cues
and light transmit poorly,

00:02:56.148 --> 00:03:00.223
sound is the sense by which they see.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.561
And sound transmits very well underwater,

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:04.517
much better than it does in air,

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.535
so signals can be heard
over great distances.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.181
In the Arctic, this
is especially important,

00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:15.118
because not only do Arctic marine
mammals have to hear each other,

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:18.253
but they also have to listen
for cues in the environment

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:22.185
that might indicate
heavy ice ahead or open water.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:26.081
Remember, although they spend
most of their lives underwater,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.329
they are mammals,

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:29.632
and so they have to surface to breathe.

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:34.134
So they might listen
for thin ice or no ice,

00:03:34.158 --> 00:03:37.207
or listen for echoes off nearby ice.

00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:44.034
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich
and varied underwater soundscape.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:45.788
In the spring,

00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:47.946
it can be a cacophony of sound.

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:53.035
(Marine mammal sounds)

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.879
But when the ice is frozen solid,

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:11.611
and there are no big temperature
shifts or current changes,

00:04:11.635 --> 00:04:15.934
the underwater Arctic has some
of the lowest ambient noise levels

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.678
of the world's oceans.

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:19.024
But this is changing.

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:22.712
This is primarily due to a decrease
in seasonal sea ice,

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:27.208
which is a direct result of human
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:31.080
We are, in effect, with climate change,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.778
conducting a completely uncontrolled
experiment with our planet.

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:37.674
Over the past 30 years,

00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:41.551
areas of the Arctic have seen
decreases in seasonal sea ice

00:04:41.575 --> 00:04:45.990
from anywhere from
six weeks to four months.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.250
This decrease in sea ice is sometimes
referred to as an increase

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:53.137
in the open water season.

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.672
That is the time of year when
the Arctic is navigable to vessels.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.034
And not only is the extent
of ice changing,

00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:04.494
but the age and the width of ice is, too.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:06.634
Now, you may well have heard

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:10.141
that a decrease in seasonal sea ice
is causing a loss of habitat

00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:12.296
for animals that rely on sea ice,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.893
such as ice seals,
or walrus, or polar bears.

00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:21.517
Decreasing sea ice is also causing
increased erosion along coastal villages,

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.107
and changing prey availability
for marine birds and mammals.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.217
Climate change and decreases in sea ice

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:33.756
are also altering the underwater
soundscape of the Arctic.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.918
What do I mean by soundscape?

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:40.510
Those of us who eavesdrop
on the oceans for a living

00:05:40.534 --> 00:05:42.788
use instruments called hydrophones,

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:44.857
which are underwater microphones,

00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:46.827
and we record ambient noise --

00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:48.775
the noise all around us.

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:52.140
And the soundscape describes
the different contributors

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:53.681
to this noise field.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:57.164
What we are hearing on our hydrophones

00:05:57.188 --> 00:06:00.723
are the very real sounds
of climate change.

00:06:01.323 --> 00:06:03.961
We are hearing these changes
from three fronts:

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:06.423
from the air,

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:07.900
from the water

00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:09.273
and from land.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.359
First: air.

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:16.337
Wind on water creates waves.

00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.186
These waves make bubbles;

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.577
the bubbles break,

00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:21.107
and when they do,

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.334
they make noise.

00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:26.262
And this noise is like a hiss
or a static in the background.

00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:30.069
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:33.724
most of the noise from wind
doesn't make it into the water column,

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:38.338
because the ice acts as a buffer
between the atmosphere and the water.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.165
This is one of the reasons

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.892
that the Arctic can have
very low ambient noise levels.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.284
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,

00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:51.675
not only is the Arctic now open
to this wave noise,

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.766
but the number of storms
and the intensity of storms in the Arctic

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.053
has been increasing.

00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:02.034
All of this is raising noise levels
in a previously quiet ocean.

00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:04.794
Second: water.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.175
With less seasonal sea ice,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.875
subarctic species are moving north,

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:15.451
and taking advantage of the new habitat
that is created by more open water.

00:07:16.324 --> 00:07:19.349
Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:21.085
they have no dorsal fin,

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:25.877
because they have evolved to live
and swim in ice-covered waters,

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:29.424
and having something sticking
off of your back is not very conducive

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.258
to migrating through ice,

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:35.061
and may, in fact, be excluding
animals from the ice.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.302
But now, everywhere we've listened,

00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:41.384
we're hearing the sounds
of fin whales and humpback whales

00:07:41.408 --> 00:07:42.877
and killer whales,

00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:45.132
further and further north,

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:47.204
and later and later in the season.

00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.235
We are hearing, in essence,

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.992
an invasion of the Arctic
by subarctic species.

00:07:53.694 --> 00:07:55.657
And we don't know what this means.

00:07:55.681 --> 00:08:00.348
Will there be competition for food
between Arctic and subarctic animals?

00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:05.983
Might these subarctic species introduce
diseases or parasites into the Arctic?

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:09.632
And what are the new sounds
that they are producing

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.046
doing to the soundscape underwater?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.562
And third: land.

00:08:15.008 --> 00:08:16.664
And by land ...

00:08:16.688 --> 00:08:17.945
I mean people.

00:08:18.534 --> 00:08:22.262
More open water means
increased human use of the Arctic.

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:24.392
Just this past summer,

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:28.597
a massive cruise ship made its way
through the Northwest Passage --

00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:32.084
the once-mythical route
between Europe and the Pacific.

00:08:33.206 --> 00:08:39.587
Decreases in sea ice have allowed
humans to occupy the Arctic more often.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:44.628
It has allowed increases in oil
and gas exploration and extraction,

00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:47.282
the potential for commercial shipping,

00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:49.103
as well as increased tourism.

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:55.079
And we now know that ship noise increases
levels of stress hormones in whales

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:57.185
and can disrupt feeding behavior.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:03.120
Air guns, which produce loud,
low-frequency "whoomps"

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.718
every 10 to 20 seconds,

00:09:05.742 --> 00:09:08.983
changed the swimming and vocal
behavior of whales.

00:09:09.543 --> 00:09:14.481
And all of these sound sources
are decreasing the acoustic space

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:17.722
over which Arctic marine mammals
can communicate.

00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:23.118
Now, Arctic marine mammals
are used to very high levels of noise

00:09:23.142 --> 00:09:24.623
at certain times of the year.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:29.223
But this is primarily from other
animals or from sea ice,

00:09:29.247 --> 00:09:31.743
and these are the sounds
with which they've evolved,

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:35.257
and these are sounds that are vital
to their very survival.

00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.476
These new sounds
are loud and they're alien.

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:44.132
They might impact the environment
in ways that we think we understand,

00:09:44.156 --> 00:09:46.449
but also in ways that we don't.

00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:53.619
Remember, sound is the most
important sense for these animals.

00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:58.218
And not only is the physical habitat
of the Arctic changing rapidly,

00:09:58.242 --> 00:10:00.458
but the acoustic habitat is, too.

00:10:00.906 --> 00:10:04.623
It's as if we've plucked these animals up
from the quiet countryside

00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:07.903
and dropped them into a big city
in the middle of rush hour.

00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:10.261
And they can't escape it.

00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:13.514
So what can we do now?

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:17.227
We can't decrease wind speeds

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.431
or keep subarctic animals
from migrating north,

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:22.888
but we can work on local solutions

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:25.707
to reducing human-caused underwater noise.

00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:29.794
One of these solutions
is to slow down ships

00:10:29.818 --> 00:10:31.608
that traverse the Arctic,

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:35.070
because a slower ship is a quieter ship.

00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:39.546
We can restrict access
in seasons and regions

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.861
that are important for mating
or feeding or migrating.

00:10:44.317 --> 00:10:47.621
We can get smarter about quieting ships

00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:50.397
and find better ways
to explore the ocean bottom.

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:53.490
And the good news is,

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:56.306
there are people
working on this right now.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.561
But ultimately,

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:02.452
we humans have to do the hard work

00:11:02.476 --> 00:11:06.632
of reversing or at the very
least decelerating

00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:09.128
human-caused atmospheric changes.

00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:13.611
So, let's return to this idea
of a silent world underwater.

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:16.321
It's entirely possible

00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:19.682
that many of the whales
swimming in the Arctic today,

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:23.241
especially long-lived species
like the bowhead whale

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:27.022
that the Inuits say can live
two human lives --

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:30.807
it's possible that these whales
were alive in 1956,

00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:32.716
when Jacques Cousteau made his film.

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:35.409
And in retrospect,

00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:39.341
considering all the noise
we are creating in the oceans today,

00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:43.524
perhaps it really was "The Silent World."

00:11:44.693 --> 00:11:45.957
Thank you.

00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:48.385
(Applause)
