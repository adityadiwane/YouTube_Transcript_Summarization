00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.678
On March 14, this year,

00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:21.558
I posted this poster on Facebook.

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:23.983
This is an image of me and my daughter

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:26.717
holding the Israeli flag.

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.802
I will try to explain to you about the context of why

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:32.408
and when I posted.

00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:35.529
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:37.833
on the line at the grocery store,

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.119
and the owner and one of the clients

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:42.809
were talking to each other,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.867
and the owner was explaining to the client

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.343
that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:53.056
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:55.717
(Laughter)

00:00:55.717 --> 00:01:00.718
("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:04.306
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:07.681
and we have people, you know, afraid.

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.244
It's like every year it's the last minute

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:13.719
that we can do something about the war with Iran.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.391
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.643
for 10 years now.

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:22.040
So at some point it became, you know, to me,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.090
I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.065
and I posted the one I just showed you before.

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:32.127
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:33.784
my friends like it, don't like it,

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:35.515
most of the time don't like it, don't share it,

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.738
don't nothing,

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:39.731
and it's another day.

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:43.683
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:46.599
And later on in the night, I woke up

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.432
because I'm always waking up in the night,

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:51.007
and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.159
you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.242
(Laughter)

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:57.579
And I was like, "What's going on?"

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.083
So I come to the computer and I start looking on,

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:04.108
and suddenly I see many people talking to me,

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.471
most of them I don't know,

00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:09.056
and a few of them from Iran,

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:12.537
which is -- What?

00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:15.154
Because you have to understand,

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:18.808
in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:20.778
We don't know people from Iran.

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:25.143
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from --

00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:28.597
it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:31.334
And now people from Iran are talking to me.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.843
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:39.703
she saw the poster and she asked her family to come,

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:41.319
because they don't have a computer, she asked her family

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.867
to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:47.549
So I'm like, whoa.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.967
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.016
People are crying, and she came, she read the text,

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:56.716
and she started to cry.

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.354
And everybody's crying now. (Laughter)

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:02.154
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,

00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:05.468
as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:09.166
what I'd just seen, and people started to see them

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.766
and to share them, and that's how it started.

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:15.505
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking,

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:17.728
I said to myself, and my wife said to me,

00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:18.994
I also want a poster,

00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:22.456
so this is her. (Laughter)

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:27.438
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:30.548
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,

00:03:30.548 --> 00:03:33.846
but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:34.749
who want to say something.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.586
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.674
and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:43.356
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:47.447
and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:50.344
And that's how it started. And that's how, really,

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:53.757
it's unleashed, because suddenly people

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:56.207
from Facebook, friends and others,

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:59.164
just understand that they can be part of it.

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:00.898
It's not just one dude making one poster,

00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:04.411
it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.787
and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:11.421
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:14.789
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:19.104
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:22.227
to come, graphic designers most of them,

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:24.830
to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.486
It was a huge amount of pictures.

00:04:27.486 --> 00:04:30.881
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.

00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.404
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,

00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:40.090
but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.772
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it,

00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:47.237
because I know people: They don't read, they see images.

00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:50.213
If it's an image, they may read it.

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:52.930
So here are a few of them.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.203
("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!")

00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:58.739
("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:02.553
of a girl who has been raised in Iran

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:07.831
to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,

00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:11.162
and now that she sees the posters that we're sending,

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:13.837
she starts -- she said that she changed her mind,

00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:17.178
and now she loves that blue, she loves that star,

00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:19.513
and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,

00:05:19.513 --> 00:05:23.333
and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:28.416
and just a few days after I posted the first poster.

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.028
The day after,

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:33.745
Iranians started to respond with their own posters.

00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:37.171
They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.513
Crazy, crazy.

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:43.038
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,

00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:44.610
but they want to spread the message.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.746
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.851
So. And now it's communication.

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:53.277
It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians

00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:55.933
sending the same message, one to each other.

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.611
("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.")

00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:01.771
This never happened before, and this is two people

00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.688
supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,

00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:07.307
and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:11.458
"I like this guy. I love those guys."

00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:15.896
And it became really big at some point.

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:19.208
And then it became news.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:23.408
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:25.707
And suddenly, there is something that was happening

00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.533
that was good news. So the guys on the news,

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.221
they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."

00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:33.420
And they just came, and it was so much,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.859
I remember one day, Michal,

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.659
she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.717
"Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."

00:06:42.717 --> 00:06:48.214
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?

00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:51.130
Who is everybody?""Everybody."

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.744
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:54.484
"Lebanon?""Lebanon."

00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:58.455
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:01.167
It's everybody." The Chinese.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:06.793
And we were just at the beginning of the story.

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.875
Something crazy also happened.

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:12.063
Every time a country started talking about it,

00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:15.332
like Germany, America, wherever,

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:20.760
a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.517
with the same stories, so at the beginning

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:26.332
we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian

00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:31.410
sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.320
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.922
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:37.550
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.018
And this whole list of pages on Facebook

00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:43.118
dedicated to the same message,

00:07:43.118 --> 00:07:48.955
to people sending their love, one to each other.

00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:52.651
The moment I really understood that something was happening,

00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:55.101
a friend of mine told me,

00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:57.103
"Google the word 'Israel.'"

00:07:57.103 --> 00:08:00.810
And those were the first images on those days

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.089
that popped up from Google

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:06.695
when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:11.009
We really changed how people see the Middle East.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:12.778
Because you're not in the Middle East.

00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:15.069
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:16.725
so you go on Google and you say, "Israel,"

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:17.934
and they give you the bad stuff.

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:22.703
And for a few days you got those images.

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:25.102
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:30.490
is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.353
went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,

00:08:33.353 --> 00:08:35.945
commented on one of the photos.

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:40.453
So for five months now, that's what we are doing,

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:45.203
me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.

00:08:45.203 --> 00:08:47.490
We're showing a new reality

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.693
by just making images

00:08:49.693 --> 00:08:52.590
because that's how the world perceives us.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.391
They see images of us, and they see bad images.

00:08:55.391 --> 00:09:00.442
So we're working on making good images. End of story.

00:09:00.442 --> 00:09:05.357
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:07.875
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:11.654
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance

00:09:11.654 --> 00:09:14.196
of the Israeli fallen soldier

00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:18.159
putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.550
This is the enemy.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.022
What?

00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:25.064
("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria")

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.769
And it's going both ways.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:31.307
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.

00:09:31.307 --> 00:09:36.293
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.

00:09:36.293 --> 00:09:41.054
And you become friends.

00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:44.281
And at some point, you become friends on Facebook,

00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.058
and you become friends in life.

00:09:46.058 --> 00:09:48.874
You can go and travel and meet people.

00:09:48.874 --> 00:09:52.252
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.

00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:56.079
I went there to open an exposition about Iran

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:58.536
and I met there with people from the page

00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:00.842
that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe,

00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:03.446
I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:06.167
from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came,

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:10.742
and we just met there for the first time in real life.

00:10:10.742 --> 00:10:15.259
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.873
for the first time. And we just shake hands,

00:10:17.873 --> 00:10:19.876
and have a coffee and a nice discussion,

00:10:19.876 --> 00:10:22.596
and we talk about food and basketball.

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:24.334
And that was the end of it.

00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:27.088
Remember that image from the beginning?

00:10:27.088 --> 00:10:35.469
At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.133
And it goes the other way around.

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.926
Some girl that we met on Facebook

00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:43.836
never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:47.394
lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:49.624
because of what she knows about us,

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:53.238
decides after a few months of talking on the Internet

00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:56.282
with some Israelis to come to Israel,

00:10:56.282 --> 00:11:00.779
and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:06.906
and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."

00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:10.493
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,

00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:12.966
so we start this new campaign

00:11:12.966 --> 00:11:16.338
called "Not ready to die in your war."

00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:19.151
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message,

00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:22.825
but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.

00:11:22.825 --> 00:11:25.776
And again, something amazing happened,

00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:29.114
something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.

00:11:29.114 --> 00:11:33.384
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy

00:11:33.384 --> 00:11:35.489
at the first campaign and just sent, you know,

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:37.677
their foot and half their faces,

00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:40.077
now they're sending their faces, and they're saying,

00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:49.142
"Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:52.662
Just read where those guys are from.

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:54.977
And for every guy from Israel,

00:11:54.977 --> 00:11:58.268
you've got someone from Iran.

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:09.068
Just people sending their pictures.

00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:28.574
Crazy, yes?

00:12:28.574 --> 00:12:30.210
So --

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:38.552
(Applause)

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:46.864
So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?

00:12:46.864 --> 00:12:50.518
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,

00:12:50.518 --> 00:12:54.798
I'm a father of two, I'm a husband,

00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:59.778
and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:03.546
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time

00:13:03.546 --> 00:13:06.929
I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but,

00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:10.155
this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — "

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:14.206
I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,

00:13:14.206 --> 00:13:17.756
and I know how it looks from the ground.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:22.082
I know how it can look really bad.

00:13:22.082 --> 00:13:26.219
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do,

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:29.658
to try to reach the other side before it's too late,

00:13:29.658 --> 00:13:31.573
because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.

00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:35.994
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,

00:13:35.994 --> 00:13:40.064
but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.

00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:43.419
Maybe as people, because especially in Israel,

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:46.832
we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,

00:13:46.832 --> 00:13:50.275
and maybe that little thing can change something.

00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:54.620
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:01.356
We can just send a message and hope for the best.

00:14:01.356 --> 00:14:03.698
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me

00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:08.478
on the stage just to make with you one image,

00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:10.603
because it's all about images.

00:14:10.603 --> 00:14:15.174
And maybe that image will help us change something.

00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:18.681
Just raise that. Exactly.

00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:21.182
And I'm just going to take a picture of it,

00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:23.984
and I'm just going to post it on Facebook

00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:29.115
with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.410
Oh my God.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.772
Don't cry.

00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:38.463
Thank you guys.

00:14:38.463 --> 00:14:50.501
(Applause)
