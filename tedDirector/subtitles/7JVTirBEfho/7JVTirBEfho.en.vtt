00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.144
A question I'm often asked is,

00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:25.975
where did I get my passion
for human rights and justice?

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:27.842
It started early.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:30.792
I grew up in the west of Ireland,

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:32.877
wedged between four brothers,

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.298
two older than me and two younger than me.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:38.906
So of course I had to be
interested in human rights,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.435
and equality and justice,

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.180
and using my elbows!

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.017
(Laughter)

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.030
And those issues stayed
with me and guided me,

00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:49.680
and in particular,

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:54.254
when I was elected the first
woman President of Ireland,

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:57.174
from 1990 to 1997.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.056
I dedicated my presidency

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.537
to having a space for those who felt
marginalized on the island of Ireland,

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.290
and bringing together communities
from Northern Ireland

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.054
with those from the Republic,

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:12.028
trying to build peace.

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:17.715
And I went as the first Irish president
to the United Kingdom

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.725
and met with Queen Elizabeth II,

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:24.557
and also welcomed to my
official residence --

00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.360
which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin,"
the house of the president --

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:30.630
members of the royal family,

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:33.434
including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:40.308
And I was aware that at the time
of my presidency,

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:45.304
Ireland was a country beginning
a rapid economic progress.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:52.540
We were a country that was benefiting
from the solidarity of the European Union.

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:58.611
Indeed, when Ireland first joined
the European Union in 1973,

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.991
there were parts of the country
that were considered developing,

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:05.495
including my own beloved
native county, County Mayo.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.874
I led trade delegations
here to the United States,

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.784
to Japan, to India,

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:17.074
to encourage investment,
to help to create jobs,

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:18.424
to build up our economy,

00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:20.742
to build up our health system,
our education --

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.107
our development.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.976
What I didn't have to do as president

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.641
was buy land on mainland Europe,

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:36.901
so that Irish citizens could go there
because our island was going underwater.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.341
What I didn't have to think about,

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:42.040
either as president
or as a constitutional lawyer,

00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:45.716
was the implications
for the sovereignty of the territory

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.333
because of the impact of climate change.

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:54.080
But that is what President Tong,
of the Republic of Kiribati,

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.855
has to wake up every morning
thinking about.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.728
He has bought land in Fiji
as an insurance policy,

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:05.748
what he calls, "migration with dignity,"

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:11.101
because he knows that his people
may have to leave their islands.

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:17.383
As I listened to President Tong
describing the situation,

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:23.778
I really felt that this was a problem
that no leader should have to face.

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:29.960
And as I heard him speak
about the pain of his problems,

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:32.380
I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:38.079
I thought about her
and those who worked with her

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:43.181
on the Commission on Human Rights,
which she chaired in 1948,

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:47.217
and drew up the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:51.614
For them, it would have been unimaginable

00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:56.272
that a whole country
could go out of existence

00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:59.717
because of human-induced climate change.

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.490
I came to climate change not as
a scientist or an environmental lawyer,

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:08.473
and I wasn't really impressed
by the images of polar bears

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:10.107
or melting glaciers.

00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:13.655
It was because of the impact on people,

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.077
and the impact on their rights --

00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:22.232
their rights to food and safe water,
health, education and shelter.

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:26.633
And I say this with humility,

00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:30.592
because I came late
to the issue of climate change.

00:04:30.894 --> 00:04:32.045
When I served

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.069
as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:37.323
from 1997 to 2002,

00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:39.553
climate change wasn't
at the front of my mind.

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:43.474
I don't remember making
a single speech on climate change.

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:46.801
I knew that there was another
part of the United Nations --

00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:48.983
the UN Convention on Climate Change --

00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:52.728
that was dealing with
the issue of climate change.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:57.112
It was later when I started
to work in African countries

00:04:57.136 --> 00:05:00.404
on issues of development and human rights.

00:05:00.428 --> 00:05:03.690
And I kept hearing
this pervasive sentence:

00:05:03.714 --> 00:05:08.065
"Oh, but things are so much worse now,
things are so much worse."

00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:11.868
And then I explored what was behind that;

00:05:11.892 --> 00:05:15.201
it was about changes in the climate --

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.145
climate shocks, changes in the weather.

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:20.887
I met Constance Okollet,

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:24.069
who had formed a women's group
in Eastern Uganda,

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:26.720
and she told me that
when she was growing up,

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:31.077
she had a very normal life in her village
and they didn't go hungry,

00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:36.430
they knew that the seasons would come
as they were predicted to come,

00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:39.231
they knew when to sow
and they knew when to harvest,

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.627
and so they had enough food.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.333
But, in recent years,

00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:46.281
at the time of this conversation,

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:49.535
they had nothing
but long periods of drought,

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.210
and then flash flooding,

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:52.955
and then more drought.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.821
The school had been destroyed,

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:56.384
livelihoods had been destroyed,

00:05:56.408 --> 00:05:58.182
their harvest had been destroyed.

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:02.812
She forms this women's group
to try to keep her community together.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.329
And this was a reality
that really struck me,

00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:12.738
because of course,
Constance Okollet wasn't responsible

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:16.428
for the greenhouse gas emissions
that were causing this problem.

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.951
Indeed, I was very struck
about the situation in Malawi

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:22.857
in January of this year.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:26.008
There was an unprecedented
flooding in the country,

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:28.414
it covered about a third of the country,

00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:30.604
over 300 people were killed,

00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:33.921
and hundreds of thousands
lost their livelihoods.

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:37.484
And the average person in Malawi

00:06:37.508 --> 00:06:42.451
emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:48.690
The average US citizen emits
about 17.5 metric tons.

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:52.817
So those who are suffering
disproportionately

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:59.682
don't drive cars, don't have electricity,
don't consume very significantly,

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.864
and yet they are feeling more and more

00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:07.277
the impacts of the changes in the climate,

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:11.570
the changes that are preventing them
from knowing how to grow food properly,

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:15.213
and knowing how
to look after their future.

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:22.514
I think it was really
the importance of the injustice

00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.037
that really struck me very forcibly.

00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:33.061
And I know that we're not able
to address some of that injustice

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:36.603
because we're not on course
for a safe world.

00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:43.016
Governments around the world agreed
at the conference in Copenhagen,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.754
and have repeated it
at every conference on climate,

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:50.238
that we have to stay
below two degrees Celsius

00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:53.649
of warming above pre-Industrial standards.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.585
But we're on course
for about four degrees.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:01.482
So we face an existential threat
to the future of our planet.

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:03.126
And that made me realize

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:09.233
that climate change is the greatest threat
to human rights in the 21st century.

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:13.201
And that brought me then
to climate justice.

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:17.384
Climate justice responds
to the moral argument --

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:19.440
both sides of the moral argument --

00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:21.882
to address climate change.

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:23.057
First of all,

00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:26.945
to be on the side of those who are
suffering most and are most effected.

00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:28.651
And secondly,

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:33.676
to make sure that they're not left behind
again, when we start to move

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.509
and start to address climate change
with climate action,

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:38.055
as we are doing.

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:42.628
In our very unequal world today,

00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:46.231
it's very striking how many
people are left behind.

00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:52.937
In our world of 7.2 billion people,
about 3 billion are left behind.

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:57.675
1.3 billion don't have access
to electricity,

00:08:57.699 --> 00:09:01.203
and they light their homes
with kerosene and candles,

00:09:01.227 --> 00:09:02.902
both of which are dangerous.

00:09:02.926 --> 00:09:09.417
And in fact they spend a lot of their
tiny income on that form of lighting.

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:13.294
2.6 billion people cook on open fires --

00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:17.303
on coal, wood and animal dung.

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:22.001
And this causes
about 4 million deaths a year

00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:24.247
from indoor smoke inhalation,

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:28.181
and of course, most of those
who die are women.

00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:32.633
So we have a very unequal world,

00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:39.101
and we need to change
from "business as usual."

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:45.189
And we shouldn't underestimate
the scale and the transformative nature

00:09:45.213 --> 00:09:47.950
of the change which will be needed,

00:09:47.974 --> 00:09:54.563
because we have to go to zero
carbon emissions by about 2050,

00:09:54.587 --> 00:09:58.952
if we're going to stay below
two degrees Celsius of warming.

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:03.976
And that means we have to leave
about two-thirds of the known resources

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.207
of fossil fuels in the ground.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.287
It's a very big change,

00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:10.843
and it means that obviously,

00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:13.509
industrialized countries
must cut their emissions,

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:15.604
must become much more energy-efficient,

00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:19.564
and must move as quickly as possible
to renewable energy.

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:24.579
For developing countries
and emerging economies,

00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:29.160
the problem and the challenge
is to grow without emissions,

00:10:29.184 --> 00:10:32.498
because they must develop;
they have very poor populations.

00:10:32.522 --> 00:10:38.282
So they must develop without emissions,
and that is a different kind of problem.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.605
Indeed, no country in the world
has actually grown without emissions.

00:10:44.132 --> 00:10:46.536
All the countries have developed
with fossil fuels,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.858
and then may be moving
to renewable energy.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:51.221
So it is a very big challenge,

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:55.955
and it requires the total support
of the international community,

00:10:55.979 --> 00:11:00.915
with the necessary finance and technology,
and systems and support,

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:07.701
because no country can make itself safe
from the dangers of climate change.

00:11:08.007 --> 00:11:12.655
This is an issue that requires
complete human solidarity.

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:16.643
Human solidarity, if you like,
based on self-interest --

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.947
because we are all in this together,

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:20.366
and we have to work together

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.780
to ensure that we reach
zero carbon by 2050.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:29.438
The good news is that change is happening,

00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:31.366
and it's happening very fast.

00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:33.405
Here in California,

00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:37.435
there's a very ambitious
emissions target to cut emissions.

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:40.771
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation

00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:45.421
to have 100 percent
renewable energy by 2045.

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:49.381
And governments are very ambitious
around the world.

00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:54.398
In Costa Rica, they have committed
to being carbon-neutral by 2021.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:01.178
In Ethiopia, the commitment
is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:08.136
Apple have pledged that their factories
in China will use renewable energy.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.293
And there is a race on at the moment

00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:15.254
to convert electricity
from tidal and wave power,

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:19.497
in order that we can leave
the coal in the ground.

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:24.344
And that change is both welcome
and is happening very rapidly.

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:25.753
But it's still not enough,

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.044
and the political will
is still not enough.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:33.442
Let me come back to President Tong
and his people in Kiribati.

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:40.868
They actually could be able to live
on their island and have a solution,

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:43.113
but it would take a lot of political will.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.748
President Tong told me
about his ambitious idea

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:54.132
to either build up or even float
the little islands where his people live.

00:12:55.018 --> 00:12:59.084
This, of course, is beyond
the resources of Kiribati itself.

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:03.156
It would require great solidarity
and support from other countries,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.402
and it would require
the kind of imaginative idea

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:11.979
that we bring together when we want
to have a space station in the air.

00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:17.291
But wouldn't it be wonderful
to have this engineering wonder

00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:20.848
and to allow a people to remain
in their sovereign territory,

00:13:20.872 --> 00:13:23.991
and be part of the community of nations?

00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:28.798
That is the kind of idea
that we should be thinking about.

00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:34.455
Yes, the challenges
of the transformation we need are big,

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.027
but they can be solved.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.082
We are actually, as a people,

00:13:39.106 --> 00:13:42.400
very capable of coming together
to solve problems.

00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:46.440
I was very conscious of this
as I took part this year

00:13:46.464 --> 00:13:50.221
in commemoration of the 70th anniversary

00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:54.910
of the end of the Second
World War in 1945.

00:13:55.744 --> 00:13:58.345
1945 was an extraordinary year.

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:01.973
It was a year when the world faced

00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:05.524
what must have seemed almost
insoluble problems --

00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:10.097
the devastation of the world wars,
particularly the Second World War;

00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:13.328
the fragile peace that had
been brought about;

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.986
the need for a whole
economic regeneration.

00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:20.868
But the leaders of that time
didn't flinch from this.

00:14:20.892 --> 00:14:25.222
They had the capacity, they had
a sense of being driven by

00:14:25.246 --> 00:14:29.297
never again must the world
have this kind of problem.

00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:33.037
And they had to build structures
for peace and security.

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.522
And what did we get?
What did they achieve?

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:39.165
The Charter of the United Nations,

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:42.740
the Bretton Woods institutions,
as they're called, The World Bank,

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:45.201
and the International Monetary Fund.

00:14:45.225 --> 00:14:48.599
A Marshall Plan for Europe,
a devastated Europe,

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:50.545
to reconstruct it.

00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:52.630
And indeed a few years later,

00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:55.807
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

00:14:56.364 --> 00:15:01.978
2015 is a year that is similar
in its importance

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:06.853
to 1945, with similar challenges
and similar potential.

00:15:07.377 --> 00:15:10.400
There will be two big summits this year:

00:15:10.424 --> 00:15:13.203
the first one, in September in New York,

00:15:13.227 --> 00:15:16.512
is the summit for the sustainable
development goals.

00:15:17.071 --> 00:15:22.549
And then the summit in Paris in December,
to give us a climate agreement.

00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:29.692
The sustainable development goals
are intended to help countries

00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:33.826
to live sustainably,
in tune with Mother Earth,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.176
not to take out of Mother Earth
and destroy ecosystems,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.814
but rather, to live in harmony
with Mother Earth,

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:46.667
by living under sustainable development.

00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:49.064
And the sustainable development goals

00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:51.473
will come into operation for all countries

00:15:51.497 --> 00:15:54.369
on January 1, 2016.

00:15:54.814 --> 00:15:55.991
The climate agreement --

00:15:56.015 --> 00:15:57.531
a binding climate agreement --

00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:01.219
is needed because
of the scientific evidence

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:04.160
that we're on a trajectory
for about a four-degree world

00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:07.672
and we have to change course
to stay below two degrees.

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:13.557
So we need to take steps
that will be monitored and reviewed,

00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:17.979
so that we can keep increasing
the ambition of how we cut emissions,

00:16:18.003 --> 00:16:21.119
and how we move more rapidly
to renewable energy,

00:16:21.143 --> 00:16:24.146
so that we have a safe world.

00:16:27.665 --> 00:16:33.848
The reality is that this issue
is much too important

00:16:33.872 --> 00:16:37.435
to be left to politicians
and to the United Nations.

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:38.460
(Laughter)

00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:40.062
It's an issue for all of us,

00:16:40.086 --> 00:16:44.050
and it's an issue where we need
more and more momentum.

00:16:44.911 --> 00:16:48.396
Indeed, the face of
the environmentalist has changed,

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.729
because of the justice dimension.

00:16:50.753 --> 00:16:53.973
It's now an issue
for faith-based organizations,

00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:57.169
under very good leadership
from Pope Francis,

00:16:57.193 --> 00:16:58.965
and indeed, the Church of England,

00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:01.432
which is divesting from fossil fuels.

00:17:01.456 --> 00:17:05.214
It's an issue for the business community,

00:17:05.238 --> 00:17:06.642
and the good news is

00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:09.576
that the business community
is changing very rapidly --

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.785
except for the fossil fuel industries --

00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:13.404
(Laughter)

00:17:13.428 --> 00:17:16.724
Even they are beginning
to slightly change their language --

00:17:16.748 --> 00:17:17.729
but only slightly.

00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:22.444
But business is not only moving rapidly
to the benefits of renewable energy,

00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:25.191
but is urging politicians
to give them more signals,

00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:27.190
so that they can move even more rapidly.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.215
It's an issue for the trade
union movement.

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:31.262
It's an issue for the women's movement.

00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:33.364
It's an issue for young people.

00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:39.190
I was very struck when I learned
that Jibreel Khazan,

00:17:39.214 --> 00:17:44.858
one of the Greensboro Four who had
taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,

00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:46.396
said quite recently that

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.422
climate change is the lunch counter
moment for young people.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:56.734
So, lunch counter moment
for young people of the 21st century --

00:17:56.758 --> 00:18:01.099
the sort of real human rights issue
of the 21st century,

00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:03.893
because he said it is
the greatest challenge

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:07.509
to humanity and justice in our world.

00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:12.497
I recall very much
the Climate March last September,

00:18:12.521 --> 00:18:14.322
and that was a huge momentum,

00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:17.308
not just in New York,
but all around the world.

00:18:17.332 --> 00:18:19.602
and we have to build on that.

00:18:19.626 --> 00:18:22.737
I was marching with some
of The Elders family,

00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:27.788
and I saw a placard
a little bit away from me,

00:18:27.812 --> 00:18:29.766
but we were wedged so closely together --

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.465
because after all, there were 400,000
people out in the streets of New York --

00:18:33.489 --> 00:18:35.402
so I couldn't quite get to that placard,

00:18:35.426 --> 00:18:38.507
I would have just liked to have been
able to step behind it,

00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:40.977
because it said, "Angry Grannies!"

00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:42.324
(Laughter)

00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:43.802
That's what I felt.

00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:47.799
And I have five grandchildren now,

00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:52.111
I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother
to have five grandchildren,

00:18:52.135 --> 00:18:55.178
and I think about their world,

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:58.363
and what it will be
like when they will share that world

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:02.433
with about 9 billion other people in 2050.

00:19:03.574 --> 00:19:08.229
We know that inevitably it will
be a climate-constrained world,

00:19:08.253 --> 00:19:11.102
because of the emissions
we've already put up there,

00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:16.523
but it could be a world that is much
more equal and much fairer,

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:19.129
and much better for health,
and better for jobs

00:19:19.153 --> 00:19:21.125
and better for energy security,

00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:22.976
than the world we have now,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
if we have switched sufficiently
and early enough to renewable energy,

00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:32.654
and no one is left behind.

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:35.073
No one is left behind.

00:19:35.736 --> 00:19:39.316
And just as we've been
looking back this year --

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.847
in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --

00:19:44.871 --> 00:19:47.435
I would like to think
that they will look back,

00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:52.308
that world will look back
35 years from 2050,

00:19:52.332 --> 00:19:55.206
35 years to 2015,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.048
and that they will say,

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:02.179
"Weren't they good
to do what they did in 2015?

00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:07.678
We really appreciate that they took
the decisions that made a difference,

00:20:07.702 --> 00:20:10.640
and that put the world
on the right pathway,

00:20:10.664 --> 00:20:13.370
and we benefit now from that pathway,"

00:20:13.394 --> 00:20:17.275
that they will feel that somehow
we took our responsibilities,

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:21.458
we did what was done
in 1945 in similar terms,

00:20:21.482 --> 00:20:23.903
we didn't miss the opportunity,

00:20:23.927 --> 00:20:26.109
we lived up to our responsibilities.

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:29.305
That's what this year is about.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:31.038
And somehow for me,

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:35.356
it's captured in words of somebody
that I admired very much.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.713
She was a mentor of mine,
she was a friend,

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.685
she died much too young,

00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:41.714
she was an extraordinary personality,

00:20:41.738 --> 00:20:44.222
a great champion of the environment:

00:20:44.246 --> 00:20:46.070
Wangari Maathai.

00:20:46.627 --> 00:20:49.253
Wangari said once,

00:20:49.277 --> 00:20:51.231
"In the course of history,

00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:55.266
there comes a time
when humanity is called upon

00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:00.041
to shift to a new level of consciousness,

00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:03.522
to reach a higher moral ground."

00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:06.054
And that's what we have to do.

00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:09.366
We have to reach
a new level of consciousness,

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.357
a higher moral ground.

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:15.632
And we have to do it this year
in those two big summits.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.706
And that won't happen unless
we have the momentum

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.877
from people around the world who say:

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:24.421
"We want action now,

00:21:24.445 --> 00:21:26.016
we want to change course,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.413
we want a safe world,

00:21:27.437 --> 00:21:29.612
a safe world for future generations,

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:32.244
a safe world for our children
and our grandchildren,

00:21:32.268 --> 00:21:34.539
and we're all in this together."

00:21:34.563 --> 00:21:35.723
Thank you.

00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:40.992
(Applause)
