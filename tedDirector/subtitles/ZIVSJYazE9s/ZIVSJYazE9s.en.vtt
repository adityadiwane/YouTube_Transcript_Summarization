00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:16.094
Let's go south.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:22.539
All of you are actually going south.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.229
This is the direction of south, this way,

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:33.749
and if you go 8,000 kilometers
out of the back of this room,

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.982
you will come to as far south
as you can go anywhere on Earth,

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:41.393
the Pole itself.

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:45.201
Now, I am not an explorer.

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:48.753
I'm not an environmentalist.

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:52.282
I'm actually just a survivor,

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:57.851
and these photographs
that I'm showing you here are dangerous.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:03.976
They are the ice melt
of the South and North Poles.

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:05.516
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:11.944
we need to listen to what
these places are telling us,

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:18.190
and if we don't, we will end up
with our own survival situation

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.636
here on planet Earth.

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:27.668
I have faced head-on these places,

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:32.196
and to walk across a melting ocean of ice

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.330
is without doubt
the most frightening thing

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.117
that's ever happened to me.

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:45.064
Antarctica is such a hopeful place.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:51.695
It is protected by 
the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:59.100
In 1991, a 50-year agreement
was entered into

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.855
that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:09.695
and this agreement could be altered,

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:15.058
changed, modified, or even abandoned

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:19.907
starting in the year 2041.

00:02:21.527 --> 00:02:24.299
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.267
people already far up north
from here in the Arctic

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.378
are already taking advantage

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.325
of this ice melt,

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:43.553
taking out resources from areas
already that have been covered in ice

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:46.961
for the last 10, 20, 30,000,

00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:50.305
100,000 years.

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:53.578
Can they not join the dots

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:59.940
and think, "Why is the ice
actually melting?"

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.284
This is such an amazing place,

00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:07.138
the Antarctic, and I have worked hard

00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:12.293
for the last 23 years on this mission

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:16.297
to make sure that what's happening
up here in the North

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:21.716
does never happen, 
cannot happen in the South.

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:23.508
Where did this all begin?

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:26.457
It began for me at the age of 11.

00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:29.452
Check out that haircut. 
It's a bit odd. (Laughter)

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:34.556
And at the age of 11, 
I was inspired by the real explorers

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:39.320
to want to try to be the first
to walk to both Poles.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.685
I found it incredibly inspiring

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.563
that the idea of becoming a polar traveler

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:51.910
went down pretty well with girls 
at parties when I was at university.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.878
That was a bit more inspiring.

00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:57.500
And after years, seven
years of fundraising,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.147
seven years of being told no,

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:06.393
seven years of being told
by my family to seek counseling

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:10.155
and psychiatric help,

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:16.112
eventually three of us found ourselves
marching to the South Geographic Pole

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:22.140
on the longest unassisted march
ever made anywhere on Earth in history.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.874
In this photograph,
we are standing in an area

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:29.612
the size of the United States of America,

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:30.936
and we're on our own.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:34.467
We have no radio 
communications, no backup.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:41.281
Beneath our feet,
90 percent of all the world's ice,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.353
70 percent of all the world's fresh water.

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.095
We're standing on it.

00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:52.762
This is the power of Antarctica.

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:56.268
On this journey, we faced
the danger of crevasses,

00:04:56.268 --> 00:04:58.566
intense cold,

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:04.046
so cold that sweat turns
to ice inside your clothing,

00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:05.834
your teeth can crack,

00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:07.993
water can freeze in your eyes.

00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:11.058
Let's just say it's a bit chilly.
(Laughter)

00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:15.229
And after 70 desperate days,
we arrive at the South Pole.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.977
We had done it.

00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:22.696
But something happened to me
on that 70-day journey in 1986

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:25.500
that brought me here, and it hurt.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.615
My eyes changed color
in 70 days through damage.

00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:32.652
Our faces blistered out.

00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:37.644
The skin ripped off
and we wondered why.

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:41.173
And when we got home,
we were told by NASA

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.029
that a hole in the ozone
had been discovered

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.562
above the South Pole,

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:50.925
and we'd walked underneath it
the same year it had been discovered.

00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:56.896
Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice,
bounced back, fried out the eyes,

00:05:56.896 --> 00:06:00.027
ripped off our faces.

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:03.371
It was a bit of a shock --
(Laughter) --

00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:06.877
and it started me thinking.

00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:10.104
In 1989, we now head north.

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:14.743
Sixty days, every step away
from the safety of land

00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:16.629
across a frozen ocean.

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.854
It was desperately cold again.

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:24.937
Here's me coming in from washing
naked at -60 Celsius.

00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:30.304
And if anybody ever says to you,
"I am cold" -- (Laughter) --

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:36.040
if they look like this, 
they are cold, definitely.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.958
(Applause)

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:44.982
And 1,000 kilometers away
from the safety of land,

00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:47.646
disaster strikes.

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:55.401
The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet
four months before it ever had in history,

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.910
and we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.684
The ice is crashing around us, grinding,
and I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?"

00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:09.614
But something clicked
in my head on this day,

00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:16.706
as I realized we, as a world,
are in a survival situation,

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:21.070
and that feeling has never gone away
for 25 long years.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.543
Back then, we had to march or die.

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:29.351
And we're not some TV survivor program.

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:32.282
When things go wrong for us,
it's life or death,

00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.596
and our brave African-American Daryl,

00:07:35.596 --> 00:07:39.474
who would become the first American
to walk to the North Pole,

00:07:39.474 --> 00:07:44.064
his heel dropped off 
from frostbite 200 klicks out.

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.231
He must keep going, he does,

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:51.061
and after 60 days on the ice,
we stood at the North Pole.

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:52.555
We had done it.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:57.825
Yes, I became the first person in history
stupid enough to walk to both Poles,

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.217
but it was our success.

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:05.247
And sadly, on return home,

00:08:05.247 --> 00:08:08.382
it was not all fun.

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:10.123
I became very low.

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:16.412
To succeed at something is often harder
than actually making it happen.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:20.525
I was empty, lonely,
financially destroyed.

00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:22.870
I was without hope,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.585
but hope came in the form
of the great Jacques Cousteau,

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:31.981
and he inspired me to take on 
the 2041 mission.

00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:35.153
Being Jacques, he gave me
clear instructions:

00:08:35.153 --> 00:08:39.550
Engage the world leaders,
talk to industry and business,

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.489
and above all, Rob, inspire young people,

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:48.344
because they will choose the future
of the preservation of Antarctica.

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:52.730
For the world leaders, we've been
to every world Earth Summit,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.095
all three of them,
with our brave yacht, 2041,

00:08:57.095 --> 00:09:01.925
twice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:05.547
and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,

00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:12.859
we made the longest overland voyage
ever made with a yacht,

00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:17.040
13,000 kilometers around
the whole of Southern Africa

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.518
doing our best to inspire
over a million young people in person

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:28.580
about 2041 and about their environment.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:35.495
For the last 11 years,
we have taken over 1,000 people,

00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:38.518
people from industry and business,
women and men from companies,

00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:42.893
students from all over the world,
down to Antarctica,

00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:46.002
and during those missions,
we've managed to pull out

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:51.652
over 1,500 tons of twisted metal
left in Antarctica.

00:09:51.652 --> 00:09:55.111
That took eight years,
and I'm so proud of it

00:09:55.111 --> 00:10:02.246
because we recycled all of it 
back here in South America.

00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:05.754
I have been inspired
ever since I could walk

00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:09.051
to recycle by my mum.

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:11.528
Here she is, and my mum --

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:15.175
(Applause) --

00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:17.872
my mum is still recycling,

00:10:17.872 --> 00:10:22.847
and as she is in her 100th year,
isn't that fantastic?

00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:25.197
(Applause)

00:10:25.197 --> 00:10:28.439
And when -- I love my mum.

00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:29.559
(Laughter)

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:32.780
But when Mum was born,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:39.119
the population of our planet
was only 1.8 billion people,

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:41.070
and talking in terms of billions,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.738
we have taken young people
from industry and business

00:10:44.738 --> 00:10:46.944
from India, from China.

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:52.724
These are game-changing nations,
and will be hugely important

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:57.544
in the decision about
the preservation of the Antarctic.

00:10:57.544 --> 00:11:04.393
Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspired
women to come from the Middle East,

00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:10.551
often for the first time they've 
represented their nations in Antarctica.

00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:13.066
Fantastic people, so inspired.

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:16.322
To look after Antarctica,

00:11:16.322 --> 00:11:22.658
you've got to first engage people
with this extraordinary place,

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:26.858
form a relationship, form a bond,

00:11:26.858 --> 00:11:29.621
form some love.

00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:33.080
It is such a privilege
to go to Antarctica,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.427
I can't tell you.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.006
I feel so lucky,

00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:39.233
and I've been 35 times in my life,

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:43.951
and all those people who come with us
return home as great champions,

00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:45.899
not only for Antarctica,

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:49.543
but for local issues
back in their own nations.

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:55.891
Let's go back to where we began:
the ice melt of the North and South Poles.

00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:58.433
And it's not good news.

00:11:59.713 --> 00:12:03.689
NASA informed us six months ago

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:08.688
that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf
is now disintegrating.

00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:11.113
Huge areas of ice --

00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:15.385
look how big Antarctica is
even compared to here --

00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:19.926
Huge areas of ice 
are breaking off from Antarctica,

00:12:19.926 --> 00:12:22.761
the size of small nations.

00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:27.166
And NASA have calculated
that the sea level will rise,

00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:29.340
it is definite,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.753
by one meter in the next 100 years,

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:36.288
the same time that my mum
has been on planet Earth.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.978
It's going to happen,

00:12:37.978 --> 00:12:42.309
and I've realized that 
the preservation of Antarctica

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:48.194
and our survival here on Earth are linked.

00:12:48.194 --> 00:12:50.088
And there is a very simple solution.

00:12:50.088 --> 00:12:55.607
If we are using more renewable energy
in the real world,

00:12:55.607 --> 00:13:01.469
if we are being more efficient
with the energy here,

00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:05.765
running our energy mix in a cleaner way,

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:10.611
there will be no financial reason
to go and exploit Antarctica.

00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:12.670
It won't make financial sense,

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:19.366
and if we manage our energy better,
we also may be able to slow down,

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.506
maybe even stop,

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:25.547
this great ice melt that threatens us.

00:13:25.547 --> 00:13:29.097
It's a big challenge, and what
is our response to it?

00:13:29.097 --> 00:13:33.069
We've got to go back one last time,

00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:34.965
and at the end of next year,

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:38.800
we will go back to the
South Geographic Pole,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.052
where we arrived 30 years ago on foot,

00:13:43.052 --> 00:13:48.777
and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:54.827
but this time only using
renewable energy to survive.

00:13:54.827 --> 00:14:00.386
We will walk across those icecaps,
which far down below are melting,

00:14:00.386 --> 00:14:05.295
hopefully inspiring some
solutions on that issue.

00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:07.720
This is my son, Barney.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.511
He is coming with me.

00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:15.261
He is committed to walking
side by side with his father,

00:14:15.261 --> 00:14:19.275
and what he will do is
to translate these messages

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:24.900
and inspire these messages
to the minds of future young leaders.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.939
I'm extremely proud of him.

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:30.421
Good on him, Barney.

00:14:31.623 --> 00:14:37.609
Ladies and gentlemen, 
a survivor -- and I'm good --

00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:45.535
a survivor sees a problem
and doesn't go, "Whatever."

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:50.846
A survivor sees a problem
and deals with that problem

00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:53.919
before it becomes a threat.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:59.967
We have 27 years
to preserve the Antarctic.

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.482
We all own it.

00:15:02.482 --> 00:15:05.262
We all have responsibility.

00:15:05.262 --> 00:15:10.232
The fact that nobody owns it 
maybe means that we can succeed.

00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:15.051
Antarctica is a moral line in the snow,

00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:18.598
and on one side of that line
we should fight,

00:15:18.598 --> 00:15:24.311
fight hard for this one beautiful,
pristine place left alone on Earth.

00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:26.472
I know it's possible.

00:15:26.472 --> 00:15:28.492
We are going to do it.

00:15:28.492 --> 00:15:32.370
And I'll leave you with
these words from Goethe.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.497
I've tried to live by them.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:41.858
"If you can do, or dream you can,

00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:46.234
begin it now,

00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:53.026
for boldness has genius,
power and magic in it."

00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:54.590
Good luck to you all.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.750
Thank you very much.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.115
(Applause)
