00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.022
There's a big question
at the center of life

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.960
in our democracies today:

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:20.329
How do we fight terror
without destroying democracies,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.876
without trampling human rights?

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:28.189
I've spent much of my career
working with journalists,

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:29.371
with bloggers,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.709
with activists,

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.348
with human rights researchers
all around the world,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:35.482
and I've come to the conclusion

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:40.151
that if our democratic societies
do not double down

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.158
on protecting and defending human rights,

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:44.582
freedom of the press

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:47.022
and a free and open internet,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:53.793
radical extremist ideologies
are much more likely to persist.

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:56.982
(Applause)

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.690
OK, all done. Thank you very much.

00:00:58.714 --> 00:00:59.873
No, just joking.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:01.306
(Laughter)

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:04.609
I actually want to drill down
on this a little bit.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:10.712
So, one of the countries that has been
on the frontlines of this issue

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.966
is Tunisia,

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.841
which was the only country
to come out of the Arab Spring

00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:18.463
with a successful democratic revolution.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:20.232
Five years later,

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:23.092
they're struggling
with serious terror attacks

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.829
and rampant ISIS recruitment.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.637
And many Tunisians
are calling on their government

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:31.721
to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.714
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari

00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:40.013
has summed up the situation
with this character who says,

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:42.616
"I don't give a damn about human rights.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.491
I don't give a damn about the revolution.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.971
I don't give a damn
about democracy and liberty.

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:51.177
I just want to be safe."

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:56.014
"Satisfied?" asked his jailer.

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.205
"You're safe now."

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.696
If the Tunisian people can figure out

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.783
how to deal with their terrorism problem

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:06.229
without ending up in this place,

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:09.454
they will be a model
not only for their region,

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:10.846
but for all of us.

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:16.438
The reality is that civil society,
journalists and activists

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:21.291
are coming under attack
from extremist groups on the one hand,

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:23.045
and, in many countries,

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.504
also from their own governments.

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:28.920
We're seeing bloggers
and journalists being jailed,

00:02:28.944 --> 00:02:30.382
charged and intimidated

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:31.924
by their own governments,

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.343
many of which are allies
with the West in the war on terror.

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:37.422
Just three examples.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:39.302
A friend and former colleague of mine,

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.558
Hisham Almiraat,

00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:43.626
has been charged
with threatening state security,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.599
along with six other activists in Morocco.

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:51.617
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi
has been jailed and flogged

00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:57.413
for insulting Islam and criticizing
the Saudi regime on his blog.

00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:02.927
More recently, the Turkish representative
for Reporters Without Borders,

00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.798
Erol Ã–nderoglu,

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:09.566
has been detained and charged
with spreading terrorist propaganda,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.052
because he and some other activists
have been supporting Kurdish media.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:18.712
Anti-terror measures
quickly turn into state repression

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:21.812
without strong protection
for minority communities

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:24.338
and for peaceful debate;

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:29.725
this needs to be supported
by a robust, independent local media.

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.053
But while that's not really happening,

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:36.068
Washington is teaming up
with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.077
to pour millions -- hundreds
of millions of dollars --

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.688
into what's called "counter-messaging,"

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:45.691
a fancy word for propaganda.

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:52.033
To counter the terrorist propaganda
spreading all over the internet,

00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:56.360
in Europe, Internet Referral
Units are being set up,

00:03:56.384 --> 00:04:00.361
so that people can report
on extremist content that they find

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:01.792
and get it censored.

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:03.551
The problem is,

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:08.180
that all of this propaganda,
monitoring and censorship

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:12.787
completely fails to make up for the fact

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:18.310
that the people who are
the most credible voices,

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:22.419
who can present credible ideas
and alternative solutions

00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:26.544
to real economic, social and political
problems in their community

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:30.851
that are causing people to turn
to extremism in the first place,

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.691
are being silenced
by their own governments.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:38.776
This is all adding up to a decrease
in freedom across the world.

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:40.977
Freedom House,

00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:43.031
the human rights organization,

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:47.391
reports that 2015 marks
the 10th straight year in a row

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:50.471
of decline in freedom worldwide.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:52.891
And this is not just
because of the actions

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.946
of authoritarian governments.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.467
It's also because democratic governments

00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:01.794
are increasingly cracking
down on dissenters,

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:02.986
whistle-blowers

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.923
and investigative journalists.

00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:07.381
UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-Moon has warned

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:11.842
that "preventing extremism and promoting
human rights go hand-in-hand."

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:14.670
It's not to say that governments
shouldn't keep us safe --

00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:15.845
of course they should --

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.464
but we need public oversight, transparency

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:20.729
and accountability to the rule of law.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:21.905
Meanwhile,

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.802
extremists are literally killing off
civil society in some countries.

00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:28.732
Since 2013 in Bangladesh,

00:05:28.756 --> 00:05:33.272
over a dozen secular bloggers
and community activists

00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:36.229
have been literally
slaughtered by extremists

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.597
while the government has done very little.

00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:41.955
From the city of Raqqa in Syria,

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.555
people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf
have been assassinated

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.594
for their reporting
out of ISIS-controlled territory.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:55.899
The citizen media group called
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently

00:05:55.923 --> 00:06:00.142
relies on strong encryption
to send out their reports

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:03.578
and shield themselves
from interception and surveillance.

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:06.807
Yet authorities in countries
like the United States,

00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.374
the United Kingdom
and many other democracies

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:11.251
are seeking to use the law

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:15.732
to either weaken or outright ban
strong encryption,

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:17.936
because the bad guys are using it, too.

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:22.725
We have got to fight for the right
of citizens to use strong encryption.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.379
Otherwise, dissent
and investigative journalism

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:28.802
are going to become even more difficult

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.290
in even more places.

00:06:30.654 --> 00:06:33.125
And the bad guys -- the criminals
and terrorists --

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:35.409
are still going to find
ways to communicate.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:38.072
Kudos to the companies
that are standing up

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.550
for their users' right to use encryption.

00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:43.861
But when it comes to censorship,

00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:46.196
the picture is much more troubling.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.428
Yes, there's a real problem

00:06:48.452 --> 00:06:51.715
of extremist content
spreading all over the internet.

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:55.272
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter
are among the many companies

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:59.723
who report having taken down hundreds
of thousands of pieces of content

00:06:59.747 --> 00:07:01.327
and deactivating accounts

00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:03.831
that are connected
to the extremist's speech.

00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:08.175
The problem is their enforcement
mechanisms are a complete black box,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.187
and there is collateral damage.

00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:12.929
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.152
an activist who makes fun
of ISIS on Twitter.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.992
He had his account deactivated,

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:21.541
because he shares a surname
with a prominent ISIS leader.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.371
Last December,

00:07:23.395 --> 00:07:25.014
a number of women named Isis,

00:07:25.038 --> 00:07:28.490
which also happens to be
the name of an Egyptian goddess,

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:30.397
had their accounts deactivated.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.358
And this woman,

00:07:32.382 --> 00:07:35.487
who lives in the United States
and is a computer programmer,

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.237
reported on Twitter
about her deactivation on Facebook,

00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.954
managed to get enough media attention
to have her account reinstated.

00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:45.666
But that's the thing --
she had to get media attention.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.529
And journalists aren't immune.

00:07:47.553 --> 00:07:48.727
David Thomson,

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:52.149
an expert on terrorism and reporter
for Radio France International,

00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:55.736
had reports deleted
from his Facebook account

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.549
and had his account
deactivated for several days,

00:07:58.573 --> 00:08:02.474
because they contained
pictures of ISIS flags,

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.554
even though he was just reporting on ISIS,

00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:05.756
not promoting it.

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.242
And then we have stories from people
like this Egyptian man,

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:10.883
Ahmed Abdellahy,

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:16.050
who reported recently in an event
in Washington DC

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:18.248
that some of his arguments
with extremists --

00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:24.585
he now spends his time on social media
arguing with ISIS followers,

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.616
trying to get them to turn away --

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:32.136
some of his arguments
with these extremists get deleted,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.207
which he believes has the effect
of shielding them

00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.118
from alternative points of view.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:42.602
It's unclear whether Facebook
even knows the extent

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:44.138
of the collateral damage,

00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:45.994
or the other companies as well.

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:50.172
But we do know that journalism,
activism and public debate

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.316
are being silenced in the effort
to stamp out extremist speech.

00:08:55.398 --> 00:08:59.639
So with these companies having so much
power over the public discourse,

00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:01.257
they need to be held accountable.

00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:04.162
They need to carry out impact assessment

00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:08.703
to identify and fix the problems
that we're clearly seeing.

00:09:08.727 --> 00:09:12.503
They need to be more transparent
about their enforcement mechanisms,

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:15.929
and they need to have clear
appeal and grievance mechanisms,

00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:18.297
so people can get
their content reinstated.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.833
Now, I've been talking
for the last 10 minutes

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:25.972
about how governments and companies
are making it more difficult

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:27.332
for people like these.

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:30.839
This is a picture of members
of the citizen media network,

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:32.014
Global Voices,

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.131
that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:36.151
with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:40.645
Interestingly, about 5 years ago,
right after the Arab Spring,

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:43.326
the data scientist Gilad Lotan

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.267
created a network map
of the people in Global Voices

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.213
who were heavy users of Twitter
during the Arab Spring.

00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:56.455
And he found that many of these people
served as key information nodes

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.343
between activists and journalists

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:01.392
throughout the Tunisian
and Egyptian revolution.

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:06.127
We've got to make sure
that these people not only survive,

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.192
but are able to continue to thrive.

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:10.870
Many of them are still active,

00:10:10.894 --> 00:10:12.970
other than the ones who have gone to jail

00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:15.913
or have been driven into hiding or exile.

00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:18.024
All around the world,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.827
people who are sick and tired
of fear and oppression

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:25.301
are linking up in their communities
and across borders.

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:29.588
We've got to do everything we can
to push our governments and companies

00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:32.548
to do a better job
of protecting their rights.

00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:34.557
We've also got to be more mindful

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:39.426
about how our own personal, political,
consumer and business choices

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.119
affect people like these around the world.

00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:45.544
Also, if you follow the news,

00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:48.836
it's pretty clear that that alone
isn't going to be enough.

00:10:49.694 --> 00:10:53.454
We've got to take personal
responsibility by joining --

00:10:53.478 --> 00:10:56.336
or at very least, actively supporting --

00:10:56.919 --> 00:11:00.440
the growing ecosystem
of individuals and groups

00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:02.550
who are fighting for social justice,

00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:04.637
environmental sustainability,

00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:06.224
government accountability,

00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:08.125
human rights, freedom of the press

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:09.705
and a free and open internet,

00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:11.485
all around the world.

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:16.220
I believe that, ultimately,
we can overcome

00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:22.702
the digitally empowered networks
of extremism, demagoguery and hate.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:24.559
But ...

00:11:25.104 --> 00:11:31.828
we've got to do this by really
beefing up the global networks

00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:33.640
of citizens around the world,

00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:37.444
powered by people
who are working hard every day,

00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:39.233
and taking personal risk

00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:45.164
for a future world that is more
peaceful, just, open and free.

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:47.070
Thanks very much for listening.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:55.611
