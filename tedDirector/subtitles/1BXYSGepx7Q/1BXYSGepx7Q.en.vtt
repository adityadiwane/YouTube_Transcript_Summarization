00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.753
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.485
I would be shocked if you hadn't.

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.711
This is a technology --
it's for genome editing --

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.569
and it's so versatile and so controversial

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:27.834
that it's sparking all sorts
of really interesting conversations.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.694
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.575
Should we edit a human embryo?

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.163
And my personal favorite:

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:40.648
How can we justify
wiping out an entire species

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:43.116
that we consider harmful to humans

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.442
off the face of the Earth,

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.983
using this technology?

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.448
This type of science
is moving much faster

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:53.316
than the regulatory mechanisms
that govern it.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.407
And so, for the past six years,

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:57.376
I've made it my personal mission

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.873
to make sure that as many people
as possible understand

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:03.997
these types of technologies
and their implications.

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:08.550
Now, CRISPR has been the subject
of a huge media hype,

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:13.448
and the words that are used most often
are "easy" and "cheap."

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:17.476
So what I want to do is drill down
a little bit deeper

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.684
and look into some of the myths
and the realities around CRISPR.

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:24.904
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:28.194
the first thing that you have to do
is damage the DNA.

00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:32.140
The damage comes in the form
of a double-strand break

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:33.728
through the double helix.

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:36.504
And then the cellular repair
processes kick in,

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:39.727
and then we convince
those repair processes

00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.627
to make the edit that we want,

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:43.596
and not a natural edit.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.865
That's how it works.

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.652
It's a two-part system.

00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:51.047
You've got a Cas9 protein
and something called a guide RNA.

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.533
I like to think of it as a guided missile.

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:56.203
So the Cas9 --
I love to anthropomorphize --

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:59.457
so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.026
that wants to chew DNA,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.206
and the guide RNA is the leash
that's keeping it out of the genome

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.079
until it finds the exact spot
where it matches.

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:11.806
And the combination of those two
is called CRISPR.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.398
It's a system that we stole

00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:16.316
from an ancient, ancient
bacterial immune system.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.209
The part that's amazing about it
is that the guide RNA,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.932
only 20 letters of it,

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.594
are what target the system.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.713
This is really easy to design,

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:30.556
and it's really cheap to buy.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:34.990
So that's the part
that is modular in the system;

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:36.812
everything else stays the same.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.912
This makes it a remarkably easy
and powerful system to use.

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:46.287
The guide RNA and the Cas9
protein complex together

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.243
go bouncing along the genome,

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:51.760
and when they find a spot
where the guide RNA matches,

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:54.639
then it inserts between the two strands
of the double helix,

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:56.231
it rips them apart,

00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:59.380
that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.381
and all of a sudden,

00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.716
you've got a cell that's in total panic

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.365
because now it's got a piece
of DNA that's broken.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.296
What does it do?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.514
It calls its first responders.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.581
There are two major repair pathways.

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:18.674
The first just takes the DNA
and shoves the two pieces back together.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.796
This isn't a very efficient system,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.549
because what happens is
sometimes a base drops out

00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:25.000
or a base is added.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:28.817
It's an OK way to maybe, like,
knock out a gene,

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.074
but it's not the way that we really want
to do genome editing.

00:03:32.098 --> 00:03:34.993
The second repair pathway
is a lot more interesting.

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:36.653
In this repair pathway,

00:03:36.677 --> 00:03:39.358
it takes a homologous piece of DNA.

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:42.022
And now mind you, in a diploid
organism like people,

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:46.294
we've got one copy of our genome
from our mom and one from our dad,

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:47.593
so if one gets damaged,

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:50.012
it can use the other
chromosome to repair it.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:51.669
So that's where this comes from.

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:53.982
The repair is made,

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:55.957
and now the genome is safe again.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:58.139
The way that we can hijack this

00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:02.205
is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.373
a piece that has homology on both ends

00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:06.096
but is different in the middle.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.587
So now, you can put
whatever you want in the center

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.126
and the cell gets fooled.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.269
So you can change a letter,

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.558
you can take letters out,

00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:16.506
but most importantly,
you can stuff new DNA in,

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.279
kind of like a Trojan horse.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.274
CRISPR is going to be amazing,

00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:24.916
in terms of the number of different
scientific advances

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.597
that it's going to catalyze.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.842
The thing that's special about it
is this modular targeting system.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:33.633
I mean, we've been shoving DNA
into organisms for years, right?

00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:35.784
But because of the modular
targeting system,

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.233
we can actually put it
exactly where we want it.

00:04:39.423 --> 00:04:45.092
The thing is that there's
a lot of talk about it being cheap

00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:46.858
and it being easy.

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:49.694
And I run a community lab.

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:53.798
I'm starting to get emails from people
that say stuff like,

00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:56.219
"Hey, can I come to your open night

00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:59.860
and, like, maybe use CRISPR
and engineer my genome?"

00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:00.994
(Laugher)

00:05:01.018 --> 00:05:02.519
Like, seriously.

00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:05.179
I'm, "No, you can't."

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.213
(Laughter)

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:08.592
"But I've heard it's cheap.
I've heard it's easy."

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:10.799
We're going to explore that a little bit.

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.772
So, how cheap is it?

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:15.206
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.284
It's going to take the cost of the average
materials for an experiment

00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:21.840
from thousands of dollars
to hundreds of dollars,

00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:23.800
and it cuts the time a lot, too.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.904
It can cut it from weeks to days.

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:27.738
That's great.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:30.452
You still need a professional lab
to do the work in;

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.988
you're not going to do anything meaningful
outside of a professional lab.

00:05:34.012 --> 00:05:36.016
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.771
you can do this sort of stuff
on your kitchen table.

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:43.929
It's really not easy
to do this kind of work.

00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:46.261
Not to mention,
there's a patent battle going on,

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.111
so even if you do invent something,

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:54.771
the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley
are in this incredible patent battle.

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:57.183
It's really fascinating
to watch it happen,

00:05:57.207 --> 00:06:00.455
because they're accusing each other
of fraudulent claims

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.210
and then they've got people saying,

00:06:02.234 --> 00:06:05.018
"Oh, well, I signed
my notebook here or there."

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:07.143
This isn't going to be settled for years.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.327
And when it is,

00:06:08.351 --> 00:06:11.636
you can bet you're going to pay someone
a really hefty licensing fee

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.009
in order to use this stuff.

00:06:13.343 --> 00:06:15.124
So, is it really cheap?

00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:20.347
Well, it's cheap if you're doing
basic research and you've got a lab.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.496
How about easy?
Let's look at that claim.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.905
The devil is always in the details.

00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:31.012
We don't really know
that much about cells.

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:32.706
They're still kind of black boxes.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.590
For example, we don't know
why some guide RNAs work really well

00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:39.677
and some guide RNAs don't.

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:43.169
We don't know why some cells
want to do one repair pathway

00:06:43.193 --> 00:06:45.651
and some cells would rather do the other.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.554
And besides that,

00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:50.447
there's the whole problem
of getting the system into the cell

00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:51.735
in the first place.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.761
In a petri dish, that's not that hard,

00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:56.230
but if you're trying to do it
on a whole organism,

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.797
it gets really tricky.

00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:01.410
It's OK if you use something
like blood or bone marrow --

00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:03.661
those are the targets
of a lot of research now.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:05.936
There was a great story
of some little girl

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.612
who they saved from leukemia

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.310
by taking the blood out, editing it,
and putting it back

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:12.383
with a precursor of CRISPR.

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:15.665
And this is a line of research
that people are going to do.

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.242
But right now, if you want to get
into the whole body,

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.410
you're probably going
to have to use a virus.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:22.807
So you take the virus,
you put the CRISPR into it,

00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:24.537
you let the virus infect the cell.

00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:26.704
But now you've got this virus in there,

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:29.416
and we don't know what the long-term
effects of that are.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.708
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:34.693
a very small percentage,
but they're still there.

00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:37.515
What's going to happen
over time with that?

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:40.251
These are not trivial questions,

00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:42.915
and there are scientists
that are trying to solve them,

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.225
and they will eventually,
hopefully, be solved.

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:48.883
But it ain't plug-and-play,
not by a long shot.

00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:50.666
So: Is it really easy?

00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:55.365
Well, if you spend a few years
working it out in your particular system,

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:56.814
yes, it is.

00:07:57.426 --> 00:07:59.510
Now the other thing is,

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:05.893
we don't really know that much about how
to make a particular thing happen

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:08.822
by changing particular spots
in the genome.

00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:11.473
We're a long way away from figuring out

00:08:11.497 --> 00:08:13.866
how to give a pig wings, for example.

00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:17.228
Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle
for an extra leg.

00:08:17.252 --> 00:08:18.898
That would be kind of cool, right?

00:08:18.922 --> 00:08:20.458
But what is happening

00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:24.832
is that CRISPR is being used
by thousands and thousands of scientists

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:27.228
to do really, really important work,

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:32.696
like making better models
of diseases in animals, for example,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.702
or for taking pathways
that produce valuable chemicals

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:41.608
and getting them into industrial
production in fermentation vats,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.482
or even doing really basic research
on what genes do.

00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:48.951
This is the story of CRISPR
we should be telling,

00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:52.439
and I don't like it
that the flashier aspects of it

00:08:52.463 --> 00:08:54.219
are drowning all of this out.

00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:58.817
Lots of scientists did a lot of work
to make CRISPR happen,

00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:00.460
and what's interesting to me

00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:04.994
is that these scientists
are being supported by our society.

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:06.582
Think about it.

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:10.625
We've got an infrastructure that allows
a certain percentage of people

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:14.292
to spend all their time doing research.

00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:18.355
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,

00:09:18.998 --> 00:09:23.466
and I would say that makes us all
the shepherds of CRISPR.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.297
We all have a responsibility.

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:29.705
So I would urge you to really learn
about these types of technologies,

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.029
because, really, only in that way

00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:36.767
are we going to be able to guide
the development of these technologies,

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:38.723
the use of these technologies

00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:42.502
and make sure that, in the end,
it's a positive outcome --

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:46.166
for both the planet and for us.

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:47.890
Thanks.

00:09:47.914 --> 00:09:51.816
