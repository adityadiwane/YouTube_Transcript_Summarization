00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.256
You are a high-ranking
military service member

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.240
deployed to Afghanistan.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.376
You are responsible for the lives

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.536
of hundreds of men and women,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.720
and your base is under attack.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:31.360
Incoming mortar rounds
are exploding all around you.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.376
Struggling to see
through the dust and the smoke,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.016
you do your best to assist the wounded

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.240
and then crawl to a nearby bunker.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.016
Conscious but dazed by the blasts,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.200
you lay on your side and attempt
to process what has just happened.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.136
As you regain your vision,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.416
you see a bloody face

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.760
staring back at you.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.680
The image is terrifying,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.856
but you quickly come to understand

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.760
it's not real.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.336
This vision continues to visit you
multiple times a day and in your sleep.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.696
You choose not to tell anyone
for fear of losing your job

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.400
or being seen as weak.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.976
You give the vision a name,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.096
Bloody Face in Bunker,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.440
and call it BFIB for short.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.016
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.816
secretly haunting you,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.160
for the next seven years.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.280
Now close your eyes.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.520
Can you see BFIB?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.376
If you can, you're beginning
to see the face

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.816
of the invisible wounds of war,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.696
commonly known
as post-traumatic stress disorder

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.160
and traumatic brain injury.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.016
While I can't say I have
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.960
I've never been a stranger to it.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800
When I was a little girl, I would visit
my grandparents every summer.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.976
It was my grandfather

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.400
who introduced me to the effects
of combat on the psyche.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.336
While my grandfather was serving
as a Marine in the Korean War,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.240
a bullet pierced his neck
and rendered him unable to cry out.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.895
He watched as a corpsman passed him over,

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.456
declaring him a goner,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.120
and then leaving him to die.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.576
Years later, after his
physical wounds had healed

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.216
and he'd returned home,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.800
he rarely spoke of his
experiences in waking life.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.536
But at night I would hear him
shouting obscenities

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.080
from his room down the hall.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.656
And during the day I would announce myself
as I entered the room,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.480
careful not to startle or agitate him.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.416
He lived out the remainder of his days

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.536
isolated and tight-lipped,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.336
never finding a way to express himself,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.120
and I didn't yet
have the tools to guide him.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.096
I wouldn't have a name
for my grandfather's condition

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880
until I was in my 20s.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.936
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.200
I naturally gravitated
towards the study of trauma.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.936
And while sitting in class learning
about post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.560
or PTSD for short,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.016
my mission to help service members
who suffered like my grandfather

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.480
began to take form.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.816
We've had various names
for post-traumatic stress

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.440
throughout the history of war:

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.840
homesickness,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680
soldier's heart,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.800
shell shock,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.720
thousand-yard stare, for instance.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.416
And while I was pursuing my degree,
a new war was raging,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.656
and thanks to modern body armor
and military vehicles,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.440
service members were surviving
blast injuries they wouldn't have before.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.616
But the invisible wounds
were reaching new levels,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.896
and this pushed military doctors
and researchers

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.216
to try and truly understand the effects
that traumatic brain injury, or TBI,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.880
and PTSD have on the brain.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.136
Due to advances
in technology and neuroimaging,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.296
we now know there's
an actual shutdown in the Broca's,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.080
or the speech-language area of the brain,
after an individual experiences trauma.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.216
This physiological change,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.336
or speechless terror as it's often called,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.656
coupled with mental health stigma,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.416
the fear of being judged

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.896
or misunderstood,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.576
possibly even removed
from their current duties,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
has led to the invisible struggles
of our servicemen and women.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.416
Generation after generation of veterans

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.696
have chosen not to talk
about their experiences,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.640
and suffer in solitude.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.896
I had my work cut out for me
when I got my first job

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.576
as an art therapist at the nation's
largest military medical center,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
Walter Reed.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.376
After working for a few years
on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.296
I eventually transferred to the National
Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.680
which leads TBI care
for active duty service members.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.936
Now, I believed in art therapy,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.976
but I was going to have
to convince service members,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.736
big, tough, strong, manly military men,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.496
and some women too,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.520
to give art-making as
a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.520
The results have been
nothing short of spectacular.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.376
Vivid, symbolic artwork

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.376
is being created
by our servicemen and women,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.920
and every work of art tells a story.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.136
We've observed that the process
of art therapy bypasses

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.120
the speech-language issue with the brain.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.360
Art-making accesses the same sensory
areas of the brain that encode trauma.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.936
Service members can use the art-making
to work through their experiences

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.440
in a nonthreatening way.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.176
They can then apply words
to their physical creations,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.600
reintegrating the left
and the right hemispheres of the brain.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.520
Now, we've seen this can work
with all forms of art --

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600
drawing, painting, collage --

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.040
but what seems to have the most impact

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.920
is mask-making.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.680
Finally, these invisible wounds
don't just have a name,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.200
they have a face.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.456
And when service members
create these masks,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.760
it allows them to come to grips,
literally, with their trauma.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.976
And it's amazing
how often that enables them

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.200
to break through the trauma
and start to heal.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.080
Remember BFIB?

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.336
That was a real experience
for one of my patients,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.816
and when he created his mask,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.720
he was able to let go
of that haunting image.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.936
Initially, it was a daunting process
for the service member,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.936
but eventually he began
to think of BFIB as the mask,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.616
not his internal wound,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.496
and he would go to leave each session,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.560
he would hand me the mask,
and say, "Melissa, take care of him."

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.736
Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box
to further contain him,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.216
and when the service member
went to leave the NICoE,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.280
he chose to leave BFIB behind.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.896
A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.616
and both times BFIB was smiling

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.800
and the service member
didn't feel anxious.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.336
Now, whenever that service member
is haunted by some traumatic memory,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.800
he continues to paint.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.616
Every time he paints
these disturbing images,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.360
he sees them less or not at all.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.696
Philosophers have told us
for thousands of years

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.976
that the power to create

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.760
is very closely linked
to the power to destroy.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.176
Now science is showing us
that the part of the brain

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.216
that registers a traumatic wound

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.120
can be the part of the brain
where healing happens too.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.880
And art therapy is showing us
how to make that connection.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.216
We asked one of our service members

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.576
to describe how mask-making
impacted his treatment,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.200
and this is what he had to say.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.816
(Video) Service Member:
You sort of just zone out into the mask.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.296
You zone out into the drawing,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.320
and for me, it just released the block,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.576
so I was able to do it.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.216
And then when I looked at it
after two days, I was like,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.576
"Holy crap, here's the picture,
here's the key, here's the puzzle,"

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.656
and then from there it just soared.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.136
I mean, from there
my treatment just when out of sight,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.856
because they were like,
Kurt, explain this, explain this.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.696
And for the first time in 23 years,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.616
I could actually talk about stuff
openly to, like, anybody.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.736
I could talk to you about it
right now if I wanted to,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.416
because it unlocked it.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.696
It's just amazing.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.400
And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.256
and TBI stuff together in one place

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.400
that has never happened before.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.240
Sorry.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.896
Melissa Walker: Over the past five years,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.736
we've had over 1,000 masks made.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.189
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.856
Thank you.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.400
(Applause)

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.560
I wish I could have shared
this process with my grandfather,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.840
but I know that he would be thrilled

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.696
that we are finding ways

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.840
to help today's and tomorrow's
service members heal,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.760
and finding the resources within them

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.336
that they can call upon

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.360
to heal themselves.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.896
Thank you.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.274
(Applause)
