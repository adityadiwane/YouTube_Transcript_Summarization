00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.798
There is an entire genre of YouTube videos

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.811
devoted to an experience which

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.388
I am certain that everyone in this room has had.

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.401
It entails an individual who,

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.964
thinking they're alone,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:27.170
engages in some expressive behavior —

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.677
wild singing, gyrating dancing,

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:32.280
some mild sexual activity —

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.878
only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:37.923
that there is a person watching and lurking,

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:39.678
the discovery of which causes them

00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:41.578
to immediately cease what they were doing

00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:43.468
in horror.

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.550
The sense of shame and humiliation

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.833
in their face is palpable.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.565
It's the sense of,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:51.298
"This is something I'm willing to do

00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:54.898
only if no one else is watching."

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:57.316
This is the crux of the work

00:00:57.316 --> 00:00:59.363
on which I have been singularly focused

00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:01.238
for the last 16 months,

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:03.300
the question of why privacy matters,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.238
a question that has arisen

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:08.360
in the context of a global debate,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.848
enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:13.189
that the United States and its partners,

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.211
unbeknownst to the entire world,

00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.303
has converted the Internet,

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:20.104
once heralded as an unprecedented tool

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:23.420
of liberation and democratization,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.189
into an unprecedented zone

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.283
of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.

00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:31.240
There is a very common sentiment

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.726
that arises in this debate,

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.683
even among people who are uncomfortable

00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:36.737
with mass surveillance, which says

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:38.660
that there is no real harm

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.405
that comes from this large-scale invasion

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.679
because only people who are engaged in bad acts

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.748
have a reason to want to hide

00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:49.459
and to care about their privacy.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.240
This worldview is implicitly grounded

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.416
in the proposition that there are
two kinds of people in the world,

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:56.452
good people and bad people.

00:01:56.452 --> 00:01:59.420
Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.918
or who engage in violent criminality

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.070
and therefore have reasons to
want to hide what they're doing,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.127
have reasons to care about their privacy.

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:08.950
But by contrast, good people

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.603
are people who go to work,

00:02:10.603 --> 00:02:13.505
come home, raise their children, watch television.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.261
They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.736
but to read the news or exchange recipes

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:21.210
or to plan their kids' Little League games,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.528
and those people are doing nothing wrong

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:25.575
and therefore have nothing to hide

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:27.937
and no reason to fear

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:30.379
the government monitoring them.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.189
The people who are actually saying that

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.968
are engaged in a very extreme act

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:36.524
of self-deprecation.

00:02:36.524 --> 00:02:38.433
What they're really saying is,

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:40.626
"I have agreed to make myself

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.472
such a harmless and unthreatening

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:46.430
and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.779
having the government know what it is that I'm doing."

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.583
This mindset has found what I think

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.652
is its purest expression

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:55.959
in a 2009 interview with

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.894
the longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,

00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:01.436
when asked about all the different ways his company

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:03.608
is causing invasions of privacy

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:06.217
for hundreds of millions of people around the world,

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.208
said this: He said,

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.884
"If you're doing something that you don't want

00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:11.898
other people to know,

00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:15.903
maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.888
Now, there's all kinds of things to say about

00:03:17.888 --> 00:03:20.233
that mentality,

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.473
the first of which is that the people who say that,

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:25.588
who say that privacy isn't really important,

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.535
they don't actually believe it,

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:30.357
and the way you know that
they don't actually believe it

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:33.226
is that while they say with their
words that privacy doesn't matter,

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:36.387
with their actions, they take all kinds of steps

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.154
to safeguard their privacy.

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:40.972
They put passwords on their email

00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:42.742
and their social media accounts,

00:03:42.742 --> 00:03:44.621
they put locks on their bedroom

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:45.970
and bathroom doors,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.670
all steps designed to prevent other people

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.572
from entering what they consider their private realm

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:55.273
and knowing what it is that they
don't want other people to know.

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:58.333
The very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.942
ordered his employees at Google

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:02.877
to cease speaking with the online

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.150
Internet magazine CNET

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.740
after CNET published an article

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.773
full of personal, private information

00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:11.854
about Eric Schmidt,

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:14.970
which it obtained exclusively
through Google searches

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.311
and using other Google products. (Laughter)

00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.168
This same division can be seen

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:22.630
with the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.160
who in an infamous interview in 2010

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.559
pronounced that privacy is no longer

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.584
a "social norm."

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:34.140
Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.445
purchased not only their own house

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:40.320
but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.934
for a total of 30 million dollars

00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:45.466
in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.592
that prevented other people from monitoring

00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:51.191
what they do in their personal lives.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.944
Over the last 16 months, as I've
debated this issue around the world,

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:56.360
every single time somebody has said to me,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.869
"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:59.478
because I don't have anything to hide."

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:01.178
I always say the same thing to them.

00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:03.471
I get out a pen, I write down my email address.

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:05.113
I say, "Here's my email address.

00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:06.812
What I want you to do when you get home

00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:08.522
is email me the passwords

00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:10.332
to all of your email accounts,

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.886
not just the nice, respectable work one in your name,

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:14.436
but all of them,

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:16.497
because I want to be able to just troll through

00:05:16.497 --> 00:05:18.176
what it is you're doing online,

00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:20.738
read what I want to read and
publish whatever I find interesting.

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:22.538
After all, if you're not a bad person,

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:24.360
if you're doing nothing wrong,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.340
you should have nothing to hide."

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.873
Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:34.878
I check and — (Applause)

00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:38.118
I check that email account religiously all the time.

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:41.323
It's a very desolate place.

00:05:41.323 --> 00:05:43.110
And there's a reason for that,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.151
which is that we as human beings,

00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:47.105
even those of us who in words

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.546
disclaim the importance of our own privacy,

00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:51.683
instinctively understand

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.877
the profound importance of it.

00:05:53.877 --> 00:05:56.704
It is true that as human beings, we're social animals,

00:05:56.704 --> 00:05:58.853
which means we have a need for other people

00:05:58.853 --> 00:06:01.597
to know what we're doing and saying and thinking,

00:06:01.597 --> 00:06:05.867
which is why we voluntarily publish
information about ourselves online.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.713
But equally essential to what it means

00:06:08.713 --> 00:06:11.294
to be a free and fulfilled human being

00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:13.431
is to have a place that we can go

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:17.459
and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.466
There's a reason why we seek that out,

00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:22.376
and our reason is that all of us —

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:25.704
not just terrorists and criminals, all of us —

00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:27.749
have things to hide.

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.496
There are all sorts of things that we do and think

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:33.197
that we're willing to tell our physician

00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:36.952
or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:39.290
or our best friend that we would be mortified

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.250
for the rest of the world to learn.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.452
We make judgments every single day

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:45.910
about the kinds of things that we say and think and do

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.631
that we're willing to have other people know,

00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:49.621
and the kinds of things that we say and think and do

00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.950
that we don't want anyone else to know about.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.277
People can very easily in words claim

00:06:55.277 --> 00:06:57.439
that they don't value their privacy,

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:02.416
but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:06.146
Now, there's a reason why privacy is so craved

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:07.890
universally and instinctively.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.777
It isn't just a reflexive movement

00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:12.491
like breathing air or drinking water.

00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:14.931
The reason is that when we're in a state

00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.588
where we can be monitored,
where we can be watched,

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:20.264
our behavior changes dramatically.

00:07:20.264 --> 00:07:23.297
The range of behavioral options that we consider

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:25.105
when we think we're being watched

00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:27.260
severely reduce.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.475
This is just a fact of human nature

00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:31.763
that has been recognized in social science

00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:33.670
and in literature and in religion

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.898
and in virtually every field of discipline.

00:07:35.898 --> 00:07:38.680
There are dozens of psychological studies

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.231
that prove that when somebody knows

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:42.800
that they might be watched,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.492
the behavior they engage in

00:07:44.492 --> 00:07:47.974
is vastly more conformist and compliant.

00:07:47.974 --> 00:07:51.319
Human shame is a very powerful motivator,

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.230
as is the desire to avoid it,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.729
and that's the reason why people,

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.968
when they're in a state of
being watched, make decisions

00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:01.230
not that are the byproduct of their own agency

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.242
but that are about the expectations

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:04.694
that others have of them

00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:09.128
or the mandates of societal orthodoxy.

00:08:09.128 --> 00:08:11.995
This realization was exploited most powerfully

00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:16.136
for pragmatic ends by the 18th-
century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,

00:08:16.136 --> 00:08:18.487
who set out to resolve an important problem

00:08:18.487 --> 00:08:20.289
ushered in by the industrial age,

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.647
where, for the first time, institutions had become

00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:24.644
so large and centralized

00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:26.472
that they were no longer able to monitor

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:29.425
and therefore control each one
of their individual members,

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.306
and the solution that he devised

00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:33.509
was an architectural design

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:36.225
originally intended to be implemented in prisons

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:38.544
that he called the panopticon,

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:40.904
the primary attribute of which was the construction

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:43.975
of an enormous tower in the center of the institution

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:46.123
where whoever controlled the institution

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:48.808
could at any moment watch any of the inmates,

00:08:48.808 --> 00:08:52.130
although they couldn't watch all of them at all times.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.185
And crucial to this design

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:55.980
was that the inmates could not actually

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.856
see into the panopticon, into the tower,

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:00.528
and so they never knew

00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:02.700
if they were being watched or even when.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.283
And what made him so excited about this discovery

00:09:06.283 --> 00:09:08.156
was that that would mean that the prisoners

00:09:08.156 --> 00:09:11.184
would have to assume that they were being watched

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:12.869
at any given moment,

00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:14.747
which would be the ultimate enforcer

00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:18.425
for obedience and compliance.

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:21.350
The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.275
realized that that model could be used

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:26.390
not just for prisons but for every institution

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.340
that seeks to control human behavior:

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.215
schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.

00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:33.413
And what he said was that this mindset,

00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:35.839
this framework discovered by Bentham,

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:39.168
was the key means of societal control

00:09:39.168 --> 00:09:41.170
for modern, Western societies,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.944
which no longer need

00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:44.851
the overt weapons of tyranny —

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.247
punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,

00:09:47.247 --> 00:09:50.561
or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party —

00:09:50.561 --> 00:09:52.960
because mass surveillance creates

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.515
a prison in the mind

00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:57.358
that is a much more subtle

00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:59.247
though much more effective means

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:02.296
of fostering compliance with social norms

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:03.758
or with social orthodoxy,

00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:05.320
much more effective

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.445
than brute force could ever be.

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:11.263
The most iconic work of literature about surveillance

00:10:11.263 --> 00:10:14.813
and privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,"

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:18.280
which we all learn in school, and
therefore it's almost become a cliche.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.349
In fact, whenever you bring it up
in a debate about surveillance,

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:22.598
people instantaneously dismiss it

00:10:22.598 --> 00:10:24.900
as inapplicable, and what they say is,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.183
"Oh, well in '1984,' there were
monitors in people's homes,

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:30.348
they were being watched at every given moment,

00:10:30.348 --> 00:10:34.310
and that has nothing to do with
the surveillance state that we face."

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.230
That is an actual fundamental misapprehension

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.931
of the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984."

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.582
The warning that he was issuing

00:10:41.582 --> 00:10:43.190
was about a surveillance state

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.354
not that monitored everybody at all times,

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:47.407
but where people were aware that they could

00:10:47.407 --> 00:10:49.036
be monitored at any given moment.

00:10:49.036 --> 00:10:52.110
Here is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.150
described the surveillance system

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.548
that they faced:

00:10:55.548 --> 00:10:57.975
"There was, of course, no way of knowing

00:10:57.975 --> 00:11:00.292
whether you were being watched
at any given moment."

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:01.743
He went on to say,

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:03.454
"At any rate, they could plug in your wire

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.163
whenever they wanted to.

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:07.742
You had to live, did live,

00:11:07.742 --> 00:11:09.995
from habit that became instinct,

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:12.490
in the assumption that every sound you made

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.680
was overheard and except in darkness

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.419
every movement scrutinized."

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:20.765
The Abrahamic religions similarly posit

00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:23.708
that there's an invisible, all-knowing authority

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.451
who, because of its omniscience,

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.347
always watches whatever you're doing,

00:11:27.347 --> 00:11:30.120
which means you never have a private moment,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.804
the ultimate enforcer

00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:34.794
for obedience to its dictates.

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:38.198
What all of these seemingly disparate works

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.984
recognize, the conclusion that they all reach,

00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:43.306
is that a society in which people

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:45.613
can be monitored at all times

00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:48.268
is a society that breeds conformity

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:50.510
and obedience and submission,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.021
which is why every tyrant,

00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:54.103
the most overt to the most subtle,

00:11:54.103 --> 00:11:56.366
craves that system.

00:11:56.366 --> 00:11:59.020
Conversely, even more importantly,

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.460
it is a realm of privacy,

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.470
the ability to go somewhere where we can think

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.628
and reason and interact and speak

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:11.282
without the judgmental eyes
of others being cast upon us,

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:14.825
in which creativity and exploration

00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:17.853
and dissent exclusively reside,

00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:19.674
and that is the reason why,

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:22.250
when we allow a society to exist

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.413
in which we're subject to constant monitoring,

00:12:24.413 --> 00:12:27.390
we allow the essence of human freedom

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.341
to be severely crippled.

00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:33.463
The last point I want to observe about this mindset,

00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:35.388
the idea that only people who 
are doing something wrong

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:39.270
have things to hide and therefore
reasons to care about privacy,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.276
is that it entrenches two very destructive messages,

00:12:43.276 --> 00:12:45.304
two destructive lessons,

00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:47.060
the first of which is that

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.180
the only people who care about privacy,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.236
the only people who will seek out privacy,

00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:55.311
are by definition bad people.

00:12:55.311 --> 00:12:57.443
This is a conclusion that we should have

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.971
all kinds of reasons for avoiding,

00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.723
the most important of which is that when you say,

00:13:02.723 --> 00:13:05.100
"somebody who is doing bad things,"

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.937
you probably mean things
like plotting a terrorist attack

00:13:07.937 --> 00:13:09.978
or engaging in violent criminality,

00:13:09.978 --> 00:13:12.518
a much narrower conception

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.970
of what people who wield power mean

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.020
when they say, "doing bad things."

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.327
For them, "doing bad things" typically means

00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:22.398
doing something that poses meaningful challenges

00:13:22.398 --> 00:13:25.503
to the exercise of our own power.

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:27.453
The other really destructive

00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:29.361
and, I think, even more insidious lesson

00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:32.140
that comes from accepting this mindset

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.906
is there's an implicit bargain

00:13:34.906 --> 00:13:38.250
that people who accept this mindset have accepted,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.705
and that bargain is this:

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:41.677
If you're willing to render yourself

00:13:41.677 --> 00:13:43.779
sufficiently harmless,

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.949
sufficiently unthreatening

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:47.831
to those who wield political power,

00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:50.867
then and only then can you be free

00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:52.975
of the dangers of surveillance.

00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:55.360
It's only those who are dissidents,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.841
who challenge power,

00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:58.653
who have something to worry about.

00:13:58.653 --> 00:14:02.060
There are all kinds of reasons why we
should want to avoid that lesson as well.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.298
You may be a person who, right now,

00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:06.370
doesn't want to engage in that behavior,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.825
but at some point in the future you might.

00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:10.499
Even if you're somebody who decides

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.264
that you never want to,

00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:13.898
the fact that there are other people

00:14:13.898 --> 00:14:16.102
who are willing to and able to resist

00:14:16.102 --> 00:14:18.136
and be adversarial to those in power —

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:19.670
dissidents and journalists

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.758
and activists and a whole range of others —

00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:24.252
is something that brings us all collective good

00:14:24.252 --> 00:14:27.230
that we should want to preserve.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.324
Equally critical is that the measure

00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:31.587
of how free a society is

00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:33.737
is not how it treats its good,

00:14:33.737 --> 00:14:36.200
obedient, compliant citizens,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.040
but how it treats its dissidents

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.155
and those who resist orthodoxy.

00:14:41.155 --> 00:14:42.752
But the most important reason

00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:45.153
is that a system of mass surveillance

00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:47.770
suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.571
It renders off-limits

00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:51.577
all kinds of behavioral choices

00:14:51.577 --> 00:14:55.130
without our even knowing that it's happened.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.612
The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg

00:14:57.612 --> 00:15:00.105
once said, "He who does not move

00:15:00.105 --> 00:15:03.461
does not notice his chains."

00:15:03.461 --> 00:15:05.150
We can try and render the chains

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.239
of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:10.905
but the constraints that it imposes on us

00:15:10.905 --> 00:15:13.450
do not become any less potent.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.058
Thank you very much.

00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:16.489
(Applause)

00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:17.996
Thank you.

00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:22.893
(Applause)

00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:25.280
Thank you.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.122
(Applause)

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.612
Bruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.

00:15:33.612 --> 00:15:35.901
The case is rather convincing, I have to say,

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:37.466
but I want to bring you back

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:40.817
to the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden

00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:42.882
for a few questions, if you don't mind.

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:45.370
The first one is personal to you.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.411
We have all read about the arrest of your partner,

00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:51.721
David Miranda in London, and other difficulties,

00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:53.805
but I assume that

00:15:53.805 --> 00:15:57.161
in terms of personal engagement and risk,

00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:58.965
that the pressure on you is not that easy

00:15:58.965 --> 00:16:01.910
to take on the biggest sovereign 
organizations in the world.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.345
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:16:04.345 --> 00:16:06.000
Glenn Greenwald: You know, I think
one of the things that happens

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.932
is that people's courage in this regard

00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:09.644
gets contagious,

00:16:09.644 --> 00:16:13.107
and so although I and the other
journalists with whom I was working

00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:14.643
were certainly aware of the risk —

00:16:14.643 --> 00:16:17.365
the United States continues to be
the most powerful country in the world

00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:19.363
and doesn't appreciate it when you

00:16:19.363 --> 00:16:21.285
disclose thousands of their secrets

00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:23.796
on the Internet at will —

00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:27.265
seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old

00:16:27.265 --> 00:16:29.284
ordinary person who grew up in

00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:31.597
a very ordinary environment

00:16:31.597 --> 00:16:35.320
exercise the degree of principled
courage that Edward Snowden risked,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.540
knowing that he was going to go
to prison for the rest of his life

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.322
or that his life would unravel,

00:16:39.322 --> 00:16:41.297
inspired me and inspired other journalists

00:16:41.297 --> 00:16:43.120
and inspired, I think, people around the world,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.808
including future whistleblowers,

00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:48.323
to realize that they can engage
in that kind of behavior as well.

00:16:48.323 --> 00:16:50.809
BG: I'm curious about your
relationship with Ed Snowden,

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.990
because you have spoken with him a lot,

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.753
and you certainly continue doing so,

00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:58.389
but in your book, you never call him Edward,

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:01.849
nor Ed, you say "Snowden." How come?

00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:03.493
GG: You know, I'm sure that's something

00:17:03.493 --> 00:17:06.824
for a team of psychologists to examine.
(Laughter)

00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:10.413
I don't really know. The reason I think that,

00:17:10.413 --> 00:17:13.967
one of the important objectives that he actually had,

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:16.303
one of his, I think, most important tactics,

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:18.510
was that he knew that one of the ways

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.200
to distract attention from the
substance of the revelations

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.850
would be to try and personalize the focus on him,

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.917
and for that reason, he stayed out of the media.

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.426
He tried not to ever have his personal life

00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:30.105
subject to examination,

00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:32.819
and so I think calling him Snowden

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.393
is a way of just identifying him
as this important historical actor

00:17:36.393 --> 00:17:38.265
rather than trying to personalize him in a way

00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:41.145
that might distract attention from the substance.

00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.602
Moderator: So his revelations, your analysis,

00:17:42.602 --> 00:17:44.378
the work of other journalists,

00:17:44.378 --> 00:17:47.378
have really developed the debate,

00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.506
and many governments, for example, have reacted,

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:52.110
including in Brazil, with projects and programs

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.964
to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.

00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:57.716
There are a lot of things going on in that sense.

00:17:57.716 --> 00:17:59.986
But I'm wondering, for you personally,

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:01.637
what is the endgame?

00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:03.270
At what point will you think,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.462
well, actually, we've succeeded 
in moving the dial?

00:18:06.462 --> 00:18:08.740
GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.183
is very simple, which is to make sure

00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:13.195
that every single document that's newsworthy

00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:14.841
and that ought to be disclosed

00:18:14.841 --> 00:18:16.321
ends up being disclosed,

00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:18.358
and that secrets that should never
have been kept in the first place

00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:19.833
end up uncovered.

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.680
To me, that's the essence of journalism

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.207
and that's what I'm committed to doing.

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:25.681
As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious

00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:27.868
for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,

00:18:27.868 --> 00:18:30.394
I mean, I look at this as work that will never end

00:18:30.394 --> 00:18:32.571
until governments around the world

00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:35.190
are no longer able to subject entire populations

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.676
to monitoring and surveillance

00:18:36.676 --> 00:18:39.265
unless they convince some court or some entity

00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:40.987
that the person they've targeted

00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:43.578
has actually done something wrong.

00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:46.813
To me, that's the way that
privacy can be rejuvenated.

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:49.159
BG: So Snowden is very,
as we've seen at TED,

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:51.927
is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself

00:18:51.927 --> 00:18:54.207
as a defender of democratic values

00:18:54.207 --> 00:18:55.920
and democratic principles.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.948
But then, many people really 
find it difficult to believe

00:18:58.948 --> 00:19:01.350
that those are his only motivations.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.828
They find it difficult to believe

00:19:02.828 --> 00:19:04.449
that there was no money involved,

00:19:04.449 --> 00:19:06.360
that he didn't sell some of those secrets,

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.189
even to China and to Russia,

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.733
which are clearly not the best friends

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.902
of the United States right now.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.608
And I'm sure many people in the room

00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:16.878
are wondering the same question.

00:19:16.878 --> 00:19:18.761
Do you consider it possible there is

00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:21.373
that part of Snowden we've not seen yet?

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:24.554
GG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.

00:19:24.554 --> 00:19:26.968
(Laughter) If you wanted to,

00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:29.430
and I know you're just playing devil's advocate,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.641
but if you wanted to sell

00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:34.547
secrets to another country,

00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:36.264
which he could have done and become

00:19:36.264 --> 00:19:37.910
extremely rich doing so,

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.891
the last thing you would 
do is take those secrets

00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:42.635
and give them to journalists and
ask journalists to publish them,

00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:44.661
because it makes those secrets worthless.

00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:46.309
People who want to enrich themselves

00:19:46.309 --> 00:19:48.279
do it secretly by selling 
secrets to the government,

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:50.100
but I think there's one important point worth making,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.338
which is, that accusation comes from

00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:54.170
people in the U.S. government,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.190
from people in the media who are loyalists

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.788
to these various governments,

00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:00.936
and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people —

00:20:00.936 --> 00:20:02.541
"Oh, he can't really be doing this

00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:04.206
for principled reasons,

00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:06.448
he must have some corrupt, nefarious reason" —

00:20:06.448 --> 00:20:08.555
they're saying a lot more about themselves

00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:10.381
than they are the target of their accusations,

00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:14.766
because — (Applause) —

00:20:14.766 --> 00:20:17.286
those people, the ones who make that accusation,

00:20:17.286 --> 00:20:19.190
they themselves never act

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.112
for any reason other than corrupt reasons,

00:20:21.112 --> 00:20:22.744
so they assume

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:25.376
that everybody else is plagued by the same disease

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:27.378
of soullessness as they are,

00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:29.249
and so that's the assumption.

00:20:29.249 --> 00:20:30.876
(Applause)

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:33.360
BG: Glenn, thank you very much.
GG: Thank you very much.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.692
BG: Glenn Greenwald.

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:36.806
(Applause)
