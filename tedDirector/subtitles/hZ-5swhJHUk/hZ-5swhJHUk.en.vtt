00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.260
(Music)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
[Sanskrit]

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
This is an ode to the mother goddess,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that most of us in India learn when we are children.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I learned it when I was four

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
at my mother's knee.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
That year she introduced me to dance,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and thus began

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
my tryst with classical dance.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Since then -- it's been four decades now --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I've trained with the best in the field,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
performed across the globe,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
taught young and old alike,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
created, collaborated,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
choreographed,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and wove a rich tapestry

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
of artistry, achievement and awards.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
The crowning glory was in 2007,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
when I received this country's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
for my contribution to art.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
(Applause)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
But nothing, nothing prepared me

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
for what I was to hear

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
on the first of July 2008.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I heard the word "carcinoma."

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Yes, breast cancer.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I heard other words:

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
"cancer," "stage," "grade."

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
sign of my friend,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
stage was what I performed on,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and grades were what I got in school.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
That day, I realized

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I had an unwelcome, uninvited,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
new life partner.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
As a dancer,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I know the nine rasas or the navarasas:

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
anger, valor,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
disgust, humor

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and fear.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I thought I knew what fear was.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
That day, I learned what fear was.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Overcome with the enormity of it all

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and the complete feeling of loss of control,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
I shed copious tears

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and asked my dear husband, Jayant.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Is this the end of my dance?"

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And he, the positive soul that he is,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
said, "No, this is just a hiatus,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
a hiatus during the treatment,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and you'll get back to doing what you do best."

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I realized then

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
had control of only three things:

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
My thought, my mind --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the images that these thoughts created --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and the action that derived from it.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
So here I was wallowing

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
in a vortex of emotions

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and depression and what have you,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
with the enormity of the situation,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I wanted to go from where I was

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to where I wanted to be,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
for which I needed something.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So I dried my tears,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and I declared to the world at large ...

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I also declared to the world at large

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
that I would ride it out,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and I would not allow cancer to ride me.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
But to go from where I was

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to where I wanted to be,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I needed something.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I needed an anchor, an image,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
a peg

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
to peg this process on,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
so that I could go from there.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And I found that in my dance,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
my very life breath.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
But it wasn't easy.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
How do you keep cheer

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
when you go from beautiful

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
to bald in three days?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
How do you not despair

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
How do you not get overwhelmed

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
by the despair and the misery of it all?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But I kept telling myself fear and tears

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
are options I did not have.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So I would drag myself into my dance studio --

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and learn everything I learned

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
when I was four, all over again,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
reworked, relearned, regrouped.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Difficult.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
I focused on my mudras,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
on the imagery of my dance,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
on the poetry and the metaphor

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and the philosophy of the dance itself.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And slowly, I moved out

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
of that miserable state of mind.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
But I needed something else.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
I needed something to go that extra mile,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and I found it in that metaphor

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
which I had learned from my mother when I was four.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
of Durga.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
her 18 arms

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
ready for warfare,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
as she rode astride her lion

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Durga, the epitome

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
of creative feminine energy,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
or shakti.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Durga, the fearless one.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
I made that image of Durga

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and her every attribute, her every nuance,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
my very own.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Powered by the symbology of a myth

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and the passion of my training,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
laser-sharp focus to such an extent

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
that I danced a few weeks after surgery.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
much to the dismay of my oncologist.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and badgered him to fit it

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to my performing dance schedule.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
What I had done

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
is I had tuned out of cancer

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and tuned into my dance.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
My story

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
is a story of overcoming setbacks,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
obstacles and challenges

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that life throws at you.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
My story is the power of thought.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
My story is the power of choice.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It's the power of focus.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
It's the power of bringing ourselves

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
to the attention of something that so animates you,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
so moves you,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
My story is the power of a metaphor.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
It's the power of an image.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Mine was that of Durga,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Durga the fearless one.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
She was also called Simhanandini,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
the one who rode the lion.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
As I ride out,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
as I ride my own inner strength,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
my own inner resilience,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
armed as I am with what medication can provide

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and continue treatment,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
asking my rogue cells to behave,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
but as a cancer conqueror.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
I present to you an excerpt of that work

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
"Simhanandini."

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
(Applause)

00:08:51.260 --> 00:09:00.260
(Music)

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:59.260
(Applause)
