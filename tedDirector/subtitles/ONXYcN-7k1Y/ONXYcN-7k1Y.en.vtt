00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.236
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.236
has evaporated over the course
of the last two years.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.110
We've questioned the future of capitalism.

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:26.486
We've questioned the financial industry.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.486
We've looked at our government oversight.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.204
We've questioned where we're going.

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:31.537
And yet, at the same time,

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.437
this very well may be
a seminal moment in American history,

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.786
an opportunity for the consumer
to actually take control and guide us

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.986
to a new trajectory in America.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.735
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:43.761
(Laughter)

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.386
And the idea is a simple, simple idea,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.490
which is the fact that the consumer
has moved from a state of anxiety

00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:51.672
to action.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:55.935
Consumers who represent 72 percent
of the GDP of America

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.403
have actually started, just like banks
and just like businesses,

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:03.511
to de-leverage, to unwind
their leverage in daily life,

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:06.486
to remove themselves
from the liability and risk

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.386
that presents itself as they move forward.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.143
So, to understand this --
and I'm going to stress this --

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.330
it's not about the consumer
being in retreat.

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:15.714
The consumer is empowered.

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:18.995
To understand this, we'll step back
and look at what's happened

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.914
over the last year and a half.

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.157
So if you've been gone,
this is the CliffsNotes

00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.805
on what's happened in the economy.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.833
(Laughter)

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:28.927
Unemployment up. Housing values down.
Equity markets down.

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.557
Commodity prices are like this.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:32.829
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,

00:01:32.853 --> 00:01:35.518
and oil was 150 dollars
a barrel last summer,

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.315
and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:38.502
do you plan vacations?

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:39.684
How do you buy?

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.628
What's your strategy in your household?
Will the bailout work?

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.827
We have national debt, Detroit,
currency valuations, health care --

00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:47.148
all these issues facing us.

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:49.898
You put them all together,
mix them up in a bouillabaisse,

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:53.253
and you have consumer confidence
that's basically a ticking time bomb.

00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:56.254
In fact, let's go back and look
at what caused this crisis,

00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:58.756
because the consumer,
all of us, in our daily lives,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.256
actually contributed
a large part to the problem.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.060
This is something I call
the 50-20 paradox.

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:06.836
It took us 50 years

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.616
to reach annual savings ratings
of almost 10 percent.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.836
Fifty years.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.738
Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.576
Do you know why savings was so high?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.910
There was nothing to buy,
unless you wanted to buy some rivets.

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.864
What happened, though,
over the course of the last 20 years,

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:27.048
we went from a 10 percent savings rate
to a negative savings rate.

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:28.725
Because we binged.

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.542
We bought extra-large cars,
supersized everything,

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.274
we bought remedies
for restless leg syndrome.

00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:39.204
All these things together
basically created a factor

00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:41.816
where the consumer drove us
headlong into the crisis

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.113
that we face today.

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:49.414
The personal debt-to-income ratio
basically went from 65 to 135 percent

00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.946
in the span of about 15 years.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.057
So consumers got over-leveraged.

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.262
And of course our banks did as well,
as did our federal government.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:02:59.352
This is an absolutely staggering chart.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:03.983
It shows leverage,
trended out from 1919 to 2009.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.659
And what you end up seeing
is the whole phenomenon

00:03:06.683 --> 00:03:10.539
that we are actually stepping forth
and basically leveraging

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:13.742
future education, future children
in our households.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:16.866
So if you look at this in the context
of visualizing the bailout,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.386
what you can see is,
if you stack up dollar bills,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.652
first of all, 360,000 dollars

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:24.195
is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.496
But if you stack it up, you see
this amazing, staggering amount of dollars

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.386
that have been put into the system
to fund and bail us out.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.575
So this is the first 315 billion.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.372
But I read this fact the other day,

00:03:35.396 --> 00:03:38.706
that one trillion seconds
equals 32,000 years.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.047
So if you think about that,

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:42.567
the context, the casualness
with which we talk about

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:44.844
trillion-dollar bailout here
and trillion there,

00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:48.253
we are stacking ourselves up
for long-term leverage.

00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:50.929
However, consumers have moved.

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:52.992
They are taking responsibility.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:55.545
What we're seeing
is an uptake in the savings rate.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.284
In fact, 11 straight months
of savings have happened

00:03:58.308 --> 00:03:59.955
since the beginning of the crisis.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.343
We're working our way back up
to that 10 percent.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.297
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:07.702
spending dropped
to its lowest level in 62 years --

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:10.386
almost a 3.7 percent decline.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.290
Visa now reports that more people
are using debit cards than credit cards.

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:17.707
So we're starting to pay for things
with money that we have.

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:21.386
And we're starting to be much more careful
about how we save and invest.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.386
But that's not really the whole story,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.327
because this has also been a dramatic
time of transformation.

00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.977
And you've got to admit,
over the last year and a half,

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.069
consumers have been doing
some weird things.

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:33.384
It's pretty staggering,
what we've lived through.

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:36.104
If you take into account
that 80 percent of all Americans

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:37.524
were born after World War II,

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:39.281
this was essentially our Depression.

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.110
And so, as a result,
some crazy things have happened.

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:43.484
I'll give you some examples.

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:48.173
Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,
guns and shark attacks.

00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:49.985
(Laughter)

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.892
Dentists report molars --
people grinding their teeth,

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.279
coming in and reporting
that they've had stress.

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:59.725
So there's an increase in people
having to have their fillings replaced.

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.043
Gun sales, according to the FBI,
who does background checks,

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:06.161
are up almost 25 percent since January.

00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:10.838
Vasectomies are up 48 percent,
according to the Cornell Institute.

00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:13.266
And lastly, but a very good point,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.866
hopefully not related
to the former point I just made,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.353
which is that shark attacks
are at their lowest level from 2003.

00:05:19.377 --> 00:05:20.898
Does anybody know why?

00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:22.453
(Laughter)

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:23.645
No one's at the beach.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.565
So there's a bright side to everything.

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.775
But seriously, what we see happening,

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:31.060
and the reason I want to stress
that the consumer is not in retreat,

00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:33.099
is that this is a tremendous opportunity

00:05:33.123 --> 00:05:35.717
for the consumer who drove us
into this recession

00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:37.266
to lead us right back out.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.632
What I mean by that is we can
move from mindless consumption

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:42.684
to mindful consumption.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.868
Right?

00:05:43.892 --> 00:05:44.967
(Applause)

00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:47.023
If you think about the last three decades,

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:50.329
the consumer has moved
from savvy about marketing in the '90s,

00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:54.330
to gathering all these amazing social
and search tools in this decade.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.683
But the one thing holding them back
is the ability to discriminate.

00:05:57.707 --> 00:05:59.044
By restricting their demand,

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:02.386
consumers can actually align
their values with their spending,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.990
and drive capitalism and business
to not just be about more,

00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:07.180
but to be about better.

00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:09.181
We're going to explain that right now.

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:11.986
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.711
proprietary tool of VML
and Young &amp; Rubicam,

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:17.619
we set out to understand
what's been happening in the crisis

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.184
with the consumer marketplace.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.425
We found a couple
of really interesting things.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.876
We're going to go
through four value shifts

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.236
that we see driving
new consumer behaviors,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.317
that offer new management principles.

00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.151
The first cultural value shift we see

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:32.801
is this tendency toward something
we call "liquid life."

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:33.975
This is the movement

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.080
from Americans defining
their success on having things

00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:38.386
to having liquidity,

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.102
because the less excess
that you have around you,

00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:43.278
the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:45.772
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:49.731
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea
that spending money frivolously

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:52.493
makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.

00:06:52.517 --> 00:06:55.006
The management principle
is dollars and cents.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.874
So let's look at some examples
of this déclassé consumption

00:06:57.898 --> 00:06:59.326
that falls out of this value.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.647
The first thing is,
something must be happening

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.747
when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.

00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.785
(Laughter)

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:07.151
But seriously, we also have
this phenomenon

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:09.100
on Madison Avenue and in other places,

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:12.047
where people are actually
walking out of luxury boutiques

00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:15.884
with ordinary, generic paper bags
to hide the brand purchases.

00:07:15.908 --> 00:07:18.885
We see high-end haggling in fashion today,

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:21.386
high-end haggling
for luxury and real estate.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.782
We also see just a relaxing of ego,

00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:26.058
and sort of a dismantling of artifice.

00:07:26.082 --> 00:07:29.929
This is a story on the yacht club
that's all basically blue collar.

00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:32.127
Blue-collar yacht club --
where you can join,

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:35.386
but you've got to work in the boatyard
as condition of membership.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.071
We also see the trend toward tourism
that's a little bit more low-key:

00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:43.222
agritourism -- going to vineyards
and going to farms.

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:46.871
And then we also see this movement
forward from dollars and cents.

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:49.610
What businesses can do to connect
with these new mindsets

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:50.801
is really interesting.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.670
A couple things that are kind of cool.

00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:56.387
One is that Frito-Lay figured out
this liquidity thing with their consumer.

00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:59.814
They found their consumer had more
money at the beginning of the month,

00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:01.247
less at the end of the month.

00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:03.284
So they started to change their packaging:

00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.330
larger packs at the beginning
of the month,

00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:07.374
smaller packaging at the end of the month.

00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:10.117
Really interestingly, too,
was the San Francisco Giants.

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.386
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.629
It takes into account everything
from the pitcher match-ups,

00:08:15.653 --> 00:08:17.496
to the weather, to the team records,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.924
in setting prices for the consumer.

00:08:19.948 --> 00:08:24.979
Another quick example of these types
of movements is the rise of Zynga.

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:27.283
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.319
to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:32.103
Again, this theme is about variable
cost, variable living.

00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:33.999
So micro-payments have become huge.

00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:36.602
And lastly, some people are using Hulu

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:38.698
as a device to get rid
of their cable bill.

00:08:38.722 --> 00:08:42.312
So, really clever ideas there
that are being taken ahold of

00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:44.507
and that marketers
are starting to understand.

00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:47.161
The second of the four values
is this movement toward

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:48.490
ethics and fair play.

00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:51.651
We see that play itself out
with empathy and respect.

00:08:51.675 --> 00:08:53.296
The consumer is demanding it.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.486
And, as a result, businesses
must provide not only value,

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.662
but values.

00:08:57.686 --> 00:09:00.859
Increasingly, consumers are looking
at the culture of the company,

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:02.628
at their conduct in the marketplace.

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:04.320
So we see with empathy and respect

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:07.140
lots of really hopeful things
come out of this recession.

00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:08.555
I'll give you a few examples.

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:11.104
One is the rise toward communities
and neighborhoods,

00:09:11.128 --> 00:09:14.842
and increased emphasis on your neighbors
as your support system.

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:18.913
Also, a wonderful by-product
of a really lousy thing,

00:09:18.937 --> 00:09:20.305
which has been unemployment,

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:23.130
is a rise in volunteerism
that's been noted in our country.

00:09:23.154 --> 00:09:26.824
We also see the phenomenon --
some of you may have "boomerang kids" --

00:09:26.848 --> 00:09:28.485
these are "boomerang alumni,"

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:31.242
where universities are actually
reconnecting with alumni

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:34.047
and helping them with jobs,
sharing skills and retraining.

00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:36.619
We also talked about character
and professionalism.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:40.386
We had this miracle on the Hudson
in New York City in January,

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.386
and suddenly Sully has become
a key name on BabyCenter.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.480
(Laughter)

00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:47.900
So, from a value and values standpoint,

00:09:47.924 --> 00:09:50.877
what companies can do is connect
in lots of different ways.

00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:52.793
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.

00:09:52.817 --> 00:09:56.655
They are actually vowing to retrain
two million Americans with IT training,

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.781
using their existing infrastructure
to do something good.

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:02.266
Also, a really interesting
company is GORE-TEX.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.000
GORE-TEX is all about
personal accountability

00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:06.973
of their management and their employees,

00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:10.555
to the point where they really
kind of shun the idea of bosses.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.344
But they also talk about the fact
that their executives --

00:10:13.368 --> 00:10:16.440
all of their expense reports
are put onto their company intranet

00:10:16.464 --> 00:10:17.643
for everyone to see.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.386
Complete transparency.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.686
Think twice before you have
that bottle of wine.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.767
(Laughter)

00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:25.564
The third of the four laws
of post-crisis consumerism

00:10:25.588 --> 00:10:27.073
is about durable living.

00:10:27.097 --> 00:10:29.634
We're seeing in our data
that consumers are realizing

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:31.386
this is a marathon, not a sprint.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.269
They're digging in and looking
for ways to extract value

00:10:34.293 --> 00:10:36.386
out of every purchase they make.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.325
Witness the fact that Americans
are holding on to their cars

00:10:39.349 --> 00:10:43.211
longer than ever before:
9.4 years on average, in March.

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:44.386
A record.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.386
We also see the fact that libraries
have become a huge resource for America.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.252
Did you know that 68 percent
of Americans now carry a library card?

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.741
The highest percentage ever
in our nation's history.

00:10:54.765 --> 00:10:58.386
So what you see in this trend
is also the accumulation of knowledge.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.129
Continuing education is up.

00:11:00.153 --> 00:11:02.791
Everything is focused
on betterment, training,

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:04.600
development and moving forward.

00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:07.161
We also see a big DIY movement.

00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:11.848
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent
of all homes in America

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.386
are actually built by owners.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.268
That includes cottages and the like,

00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:16.460
but 30 percent.

00:11:16.484 --> 00:11:19.496
People are getting their hands dirty,
rolling up their sleeves.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.687
They want these skills.

00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:24.275
We see it with the phenomenon of raising
backyard hens, chickens and ducks.

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:26.987
And when you work out the math,
they say it doesn't work,

00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:28.311
but the principle is there;

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:31.050
it's about being sustainable
and taking care of yourself.

00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:33.685
Then we look at the High Line
in New York City,

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:36.477
an excellent use of reimagining
existing infrastructure

00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:37.660
for something good,

00:11:37.684 --> 00:11:39.719
which is a brand-new park
in New York City.

00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:43.834
So what brands can do, and companies,
is pay dividends to consumers,

00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:45.386
be a brand that lasts,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.799
offer transparency,

00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:49.317
promise you're going to be there
beyond today's sale.

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:51.386
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.124
Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"

00:11:53.148 --> 00:11:56.946
basically goes through and tracks
every product they make,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.760
and gives you social responsibility,

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:02.323
and helps you understand the ethics
behind the product they make.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.129
Another great example is Fidelity.

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:07.839
Rather than instant cash-back rewards
on your credit or debit purchases,

00:12:07.863 --> 00:12:12.759
this is about 529 rewards
for your student education.

00:12:12.783 --> 00:12:14.870
Or the interesting company Sunrun.

00:12:14.894 --> 00:12:16.049
I love this company.

00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:18.140
They've created a consumer collective

00:12:18.164 --> 00:12:20.510
where they put solar panels on households

00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:22.629
and create a consumer-based utility,

00:12:22.653 --> 00:12:24.351
where the electricity they generate

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.999
is basically pumped back out
into the marketplace.

00:12:27.023 --> 00:12:28.759
So it's a consumer-driven co-op.

00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:32.457
The fourth post-crisis
consumerism that we see

00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:34.798
is this movement
about "return to the fold."

00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:36.621
It's incredibly important right now.

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:39.229
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.

00:12:39.253 --> 00:12:41.445
It's now about connecting
to your communities,

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.231
connecting to your social networks.

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:44.969
In my book, I talked about the fact

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:47.668
that 72 percent of people trust
what other people say

00:12:47.692 --> 00:12:49.143
about a brand or a company,

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:51.209
versus 15 percent on advertising.

00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:54.953
So in that respect, cooperative
consumerism has really taken off.

00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:57.960
This is about consumers working
together to get what they want

00:12:57.984 --> 00:12:59.160
out of the marketplace.

00:12:59.184 --> 00:13:01.161
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.

00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:02.758
The artisanal movement is huge:

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.839
everything about locally
derived products and services,

00:13:05.863 --> 00:13:07.647
supporting your local neighborhoods,

00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:10.647
whether it's cheeses,
wines and other products.

00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:13.329
Also this rise of local currencies.

00:13:13.353 --> 00:13:16.328
Realizing that it's difficult
to get loans in this environment,

00:13:16.352 --> 00:13:18.411
you're doing business
with people you trust

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:19.614
in your local markets.

00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:23.506
So this rise of local currency
is another really interesting phenomenon.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.152
And then they did a recent report
I thought was fascinating.

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:30.349
They actually started, in certain
communities in the United States,

00:13:30.373 --> 00:13:32.400
to publish people's electricity usage.

00:13:32.424 --> 00:13:35.735
And what they found out is when
that was available for public record,

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.829
the people's electricity usage
in those communities dropped.

00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:42.386
Then we also look
at the idea of cow-pooling,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.605
which is the whole phenomenon
of consumers organizing together

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:50.522
to buy meat from organic farms,
that they know is safe and controlled

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:52.732
in the way that they want it
to be controlled.

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:56.323
And then there's this other really
interesting movement in California,

00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:57.830
which is about carrot mobs.

00:13:57.854 --> 00:14:00.900
The traditional thing would be
to boycott, right? Have a stick.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:02.270
Well, why not have a carrot?

00:14:02.294 --> 00:14:05.598
So these are consumers organizing,
pooling their resources

00:14:05.622 --> 00:14:08.386
to incentify companies to do good.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.207
And then we look at what companies can do.

00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.684
This is all the opportunity
about being a community organizer.

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.675
You have to realize
that you can't fight and control this.

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:19.309
You actually need to organize it.

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.858
You need to harness it.
You need to give it meaning.

00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:25.094
And there's lots of really
interesting examples here.

00:14:25.118 --> 00:14:29.911
First is just the rise of the fact
that Zagat's has actually moved out of

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:32.163
and diversified from rating restaurants,

00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:34.386
into actually rating health care.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.539
So what credentials does Zagat's have?

00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:37.733
Well, they have a lot,

00:14:37.757 --> 00:14:39.601
because it's their network of people.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:42.168
So that becomes
a very powerful force for them

00:14:42.192 --> 00:14:44.386
to make their brand more elastic.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.667
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:50.173
This Kogi doesn't exist.
It's a moving truck.

00:14:50.197 --> 00:14:51.796
It's a moving truck through L.A.,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.316
and the only way you can find it
is through Twitter.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.397
(Laughter)

00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:56.574
Or you look at

00:14:56.598 --> 00:15:01.660
Johnson &amp; Johnson's "Momversations,"
a phenomenal blog that's been built up,

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:05.814
where J&amp;J basically is tapping
into the power of mommy bloggers,

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:10.286
allowing them to create a forum
where they can communicate and connect.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.149
And it's also become a very valuable
advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.

00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:19.387
This, plus the fact that you've got
phenomenal work from CEOs,

00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:21.951
from Ford to Zappos,
connecting on Twitter,

00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:23.386
creating an open environment,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.448
allowing their employees
to be part of the process,

00:15:26.472 --> 00:15:28.180
rather than hidden behind walls.

00:15:28.204 --> 00:15:32.409
You see this rising force
in total transparency and openness

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:34.221
that companies are starting to adopt,

00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:36.552
all because the consumer is demanding it.

00:15:36.576 --> 00:15:38.522
So when we look at this and step back,

00:15:38.546 --> 00:15:42.738
what I believe is that the crisis
that exists today is definitely real.

00:15:42.762 --> 00:15:45.386
It's been tremendously
powerful for consumers.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.973
But at the same time,
this is also a tremendous opportunity.

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:52.464
The Chinese character for crisis
is actually the same side

00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:53.655
of the same coin.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.386
Crisis equals opportunity.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.904
What we're seeing with consumers
right now is the ability for them

00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:01.564
to actually lead us forward
out of this recession.

00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:06.386
So we believe that values-driven spending
will force capitalism to be better:

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.290
it will drive innovation;

00:16:08.314 --> 00:16:10.415
it will make longer-lasting products;

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:13.035
it will create better,
more intuitive customer service;

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.936
and it will give us the opportunity
to connect with companies

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.031
that share the values that we share.

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:20.074
So when we look back and step out at this

00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:23.386
and see the beginning of these trends
that we're seeing in our data,

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.259
we see a very hopeful picture
for the future of America.

00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:27.451
Thank you very much.

00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:29.291
(Applause)
