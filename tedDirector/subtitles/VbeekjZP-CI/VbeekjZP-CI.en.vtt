00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.165

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.508

00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:17.062

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:20.907

00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:21.968

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.830

You done robbed my pocket,

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.117

of silver and gold, boy,

00:01:56.557 --> 00:02:00.824
of silver and gold.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.627
Water Boy,

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:11.588

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.457

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:46.195
I'm gonna bust this rock, boy,

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.460
from here to Macon.

00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:55.958
All the way to the jail, boy,

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:59.889
all the way to the jail.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:07.635
Water

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.319
Boy

00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:11.374
(Guitar strum)

00:03:11.398 --> 00:03:15.719
where are you hidin'?

00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:16.750
(Guitar strum)

00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:18.316
If you don't come right here,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.774
if you don't come right here,

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:21.205

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:27.911
I'm gonna tell

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.384
your pa

00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:35.141
on you.

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:36.208
(Guitar strum)

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:38.309
(Applause)

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:47.304
Thank you.

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:53.379
That was a song based on
numerous work songs,

00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:55.442
and it was arranged by Odetta,

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:56.695
a hero of mine.

00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:59.817
And this next song, well,

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.021
I do a lot of historical music,

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:04.067
starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.317
and continuing on in my solo endeavors.

00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:10.000
And I believe that knowing
your history as a musician

00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:11.224
is super important --

00:04:11.248 --> 00:04:12.853
it's important as a person,

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.385
it's important as a country,

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.799
it's important as a people.

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:18.894
So I read a lot about where
the music comes from

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:20.539
and where this country comes from.

00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:22.687
I've been reading a lot
about the Civil War

00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:23.895
and about slavery.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.546
And it's really tough.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.724
You know?

00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:28.000
It's really tough reading.

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:30.544
And so as an artist,
what I do with all that emotion,

00:04:30.568 --> 00:04:32.158
reading these people's stories,

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:33.991
not just, "Oh, slavery was terrible."

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:35.321
Yes, it was.

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:40.273
But it's reading individual narratives
of how it was for these people.

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:41.456
You know?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.812
Then it's like, "Yeah,
that could've been me."

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:45.530
And it is people now. You know?

00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:47.293
So what you do with all that emotion

00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:49.150
is you've got to do something with it.

00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:50.327
As an artist, I write.

00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.470
So I wrote a song based on
some of those narratives that I read,

00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:55.561
and it's called, "Come Love Come."

00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:57.621
We're going to do it for you now.

00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:05.241
(Claps)

00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:08.704
(Sings) Come love come,

00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:10.288
the road lies low,

00:05:10.312 --> 00:05:13.556
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.090
Come love come,

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.004
the road lies free,

00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:20.026
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:21.921
(Music)

00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:35.005
(Sings) When I was four,

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.879
my loving mam was cornered
by the boss's man.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:43.197
She turned her head and got struck down,

00:05:43.221 --> 00:05:46.503
they buried her in the cold, cold ground.

00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:48.107
Come love come,

00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:49.893
the road lies low,

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:53.074
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:05:53.098 --> 00:05:54.856
Come love come,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.468
the road lies free,

00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:59.389
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:05:59.413 --> 00:06:01.750
(Music)

00:06:06.287 --> 00:06:07.663
When I was 12,

00:06:07.687 --> 00:06:09.396
my father dear

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.816
was strong of arm and free of fear

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.965
until the day he raised his hand,

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:19.187
then he was sold to Alabama.

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.067
Come love come,

00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:22.906
the road lies low,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.050
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:27.615
Come love come,

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.398
the road lies free,

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.540
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:34.461
(Music)

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.766
When I was 16, found my bloom

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.248
and found my man,

00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:51.818
we jumped the broom.

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:54.896
We pledged each other
the rest of our lives

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.333
and on Saturday nights
we were man and wife.

00:06:58.357 --> 00:07:00.013
Come love come,

00:07:00.037 --> 00:07:01.675
the road lies low,

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.408
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:06.501
Come love come,

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.117
the road lies free,

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:10.897
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.800
(Music)

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:25.735
When I was 18,

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.332
bugles called

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:30.490
and boys in blue came o'er the wall.

00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:33.702
I took my chance and followed free,

00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:36.535
they led the way to Tennessee.

00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:38.770
Come love come,

00:07:38.794 --> 00:07:40.446
the road lies low,

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.215
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:07:43.623 --> 00:07:45.290
Come love come,

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:46.937
the road lies free,

00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:50.184
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:52.845
(Music)

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:05.739
Now here I sit in a tiny shack

00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:08.902
with 13 others at my back.

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.497
I've sent you word,

00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:12.115
so all I can do

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:15.264
is wait and wait and wait and wait

00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:20.079
and wait

00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:23.342
and wait for you.

00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:26.526
Come love come,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.156
the road lies low,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.828
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:32.836
Come love come,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.552
the road lies free,

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:37.679
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:39.357
Come love come,

00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:40.933
the road lies low,

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:44.156
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.760
Come love come,

00:08:45.784 --> 00:08:47.404
the road lies free,

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:54.030
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:08:58.235 --> 00:09:03.534
Oh,

00:09:03.558 --> 00:09:09.490
oh,

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:12.372
oh.

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:17.791
Whoa ... oh I'll wait for you.

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:21.729
I'll wait for you.

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:27.201
I'll wait for you

00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:29.106
I'll wait for you.

00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:33.418
(Applause)

00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:44.655
Thank you.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.542
So, with the dark
you have to have the light.

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:51.108
And in the African-American community,

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.353
it's been the work of many
hundreds of years

00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:55.463
to find a way to lift ourselves up.

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:59.750
So I'm going to end with a couple
of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:02.785
one of the more influential
American music figures

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:04.835
that most of you probably never heard of.

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:06.975
If you have, I'm so happy.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:09.463
She's one of the innovators
of rock 'n' roll guitar,

00:10:09.487 --> 00:10:13.116
and one of the first crossover artists
from gospel to secular.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.914
She's an incredibly important figure,

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:17.131
and I'm going to talk about her
whenever I can.

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:18.822
So these are a couple of her tunes.

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:21.855
And don't worry -- you're going to get
your chance to sing.

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:23.948
(Music)

00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:34.097
(Sings) Look down, look down

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:36.769
that lonesome road

00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:40.422
before you travel on.

00:10:41.587 --> 00:10:43.745
Look up, look up

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:46.586
and greet your maker,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.360
for Gabriel blows his horn.

00:10:52.457 --> 00:10:56.399
Weary totin' such a load,

00:10:57.478 --> 00:11:01.180
goin' down that lonesome road.

00:11:01.204 --> 00:11:06.375
Look down that lonesome road,

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.254
before you travel on.

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:13.452
Look down, look down

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:15.997
that lonesome road

00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:19.549
before you travel on.

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:22.889
Look up, look up

00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:25.557
and greet your maker,

00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:29.517
for Gabriel blows his horn.

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:35.091
Weary totin' such a load,

00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:39.771
goin' down that lonesome road.

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:42.624
Look down, look down, look down, look down

00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:44.711
that lonesome road

00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:48.643
before you travel on.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.950
Up above my head

00:11:49.974 --> 00:11:51.178
up above my head
