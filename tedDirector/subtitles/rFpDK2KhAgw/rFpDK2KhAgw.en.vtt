00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.236
There are things we say

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.657
when we catch the eye of a stranger

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.403
or a neighbor walking by.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.056
We say, "Hello, how are you?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.788
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:25.001
How do you feel?"

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:29.186
These sound kind of meaningless, right?
And, in some ways, they are.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.569
They have no semantic meaning.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.508
It doesn't matter how you are
or what the day is like.

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:37.401
They have something else.

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:39.312
They have social meaning.

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.530
What we mean when we say those things is:

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:43.815
I see you there.

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:48.561
I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.475
I make eye contact, say hello,

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.064
I offer help, I listen.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.379
I get all kinds of stories.

00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:01.040
About seven years ago, I started
documenting my experiences

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:02.939
to try to figure out why.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.939
What I found was that something
really beautiful was going on.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.757
This is almost poetic.

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:13.454
These were really profound experiences.

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:15.358
They were unexpected pleasures.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:17.847
They were genuine emotional connections.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.242
They were liberating moments.

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:26.202
So one day, I was standing on a corner
waiting for the light to change,

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:27.535
which, I'm a New Yorker,

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:31.066
so that means I was actually standing
in the street on the storm drain,

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.014
as if that could get me across faster.

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:36.039
And there's an old man
standing next to me.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:40.890
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat
and sort of an old-man hat,

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:43.040
and he looked like somebody from a movie.

00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:44.262
And he says to me,

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:46.837
"Don't stand there. You might disappear."

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:49.362
So this is absurd, right?

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:52.382
But I did what he said.
I stepped back onto the sidewalk.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:54.589
And he smiled, and he said,

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.494
"Good. You never know.

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:57.945
I might have turned around,

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.476
and zoop, you're gone."

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:02.853
This was weird,

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:06.067
and also really wonderful.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.408
He was so warm, and he was
so happy that he'd saved me.

00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:11.474
We had this little bond.

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:16.150
For a minute, I felt like
my existence as a person

00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:17.517
had been noticed,

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.270
and I was worth saving.

00:02:23.058 --> 00:02:24.685
The really sad thing is,

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.382
in many parts of the world,

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:30.336
we're raised to believe
that strangers are dangerous by default,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.478
that we can't trust them,
that they might hurt us.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.967
But most strangers aren't dangerous.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:40.279
We're uneasy around them
because we have no context.

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:43.004
We don't know what their intentions are.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.811
So instead of using our perceptions
and making choices,

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.280
we rely on this category of "stranger."

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:52.837
I have a four-year-old.

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:54.836
When I say hello to people on the street,

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.169
she asks me why.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.396
She says, "Do we know them?"

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:02.181
I say, "No, they're our neighbor."

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:04.308
"Are they our friend?"

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:06.998
"No, it's just good to be friendly."

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:11.102
I think twice every time
I say that to her,

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:14.634
because I mean it,
but as a woman, particularly,

00:03:14.658 --> 00:03:18.428
I know that not every stranger
on the street has the best intentions.

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:22.727
It is good to be friendly,
and it's good to learn when not to be,

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.107
but none of that means
we have to be afraid.

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.324
There are two huge benefits

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:32.443
to using our senses instead of our fears.

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:36.015
The first one is that it liberates us.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.843
When you think about it,

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:42.079
using perception instead of categories

00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:44.006
is much easier said than done.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.074
Categories are something our brains use.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.330
When it comes to people,

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.765
it's sort of a shortcut
for learning about them.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.538
We see male, female, young, old,

00:03:56.562 --> 00:04:00.924
black, brown, white, stranger, friend,

00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:03.353
and we use the information in that box.

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:05.830
It's quick, it's easy

00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.630
and it's a road to bias.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:11.921
And it means we're not thinking
about people as individuals.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:17.111
I know an American researcher
who travels frequently

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:19.945
in Central Asia and Africa, alone.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.449
She's entering into towns and cities

00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:25.524
as a complete stranger.

00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:28.102
She has no bonds, no connections.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.475
She's a foreigner.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:32.333
Her survival strategy is this:

00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:36.334
get one stranger to see you
as a real, individual person.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.239
If you can do that, it'll help
other people see you that way, too.

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:45.225
The second benefit of using our senses
has to do with intimacy.

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:48.398
I know it sounds
a little counterintuitive,

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.519
intimacy and strangers,

00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:54.595
but these quick interactions
can lead to a feeling

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:57.761
that sociologists call
"fleeting intimacy."

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:02.135
So, it's a brief experience
that has emotional resonance and meaning.

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:05.460
It's the good feeling I got

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:09.826
from being saved from the death trap
of the storm drain by the old man,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.110
or how I feel like part of a community

00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:16.553
when I talk to somebody
on my train on the way to work.

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.689
Sometimes it goes further.

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:24.826
Researchers have found
that people often feel more comfortable

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.094
being honest and open
about their inner selves with strangers

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:30.801
than they do with their friends
and their families --

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.727
that they often feel
more understood by strangers.

00:05:37.022 --> 00:05:40.553
This gets reported in the media
with great lament.

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:43.926
"Strangers communicate
better than spouses!"

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.434
It's a good headline, right?

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.827
I think it entirely misses the point.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.153
The important thing about these studies

00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:55.970
is just how significant
these interactions can be;

00:05:56.795 --> 00:05:59.899
how this special form of closeness

00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:02.701
gives us something we need
as much as we need our friends

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:03.915
and our families.

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:08.843
So how is it possible that we communicate
so well with strangers?

00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:12.221
There are two reasons.

00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:15.159
The first one is that
it's a quick interaction.

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:16.722
It has no consequences.

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:20.619
It's easy to be honest with someone
you're never going to see again, right?

00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:21.793
That makes sense.

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:25.061
The second reason is where
it gets more interesting.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.502
We have a bias when it comes
to people we're close to.

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:32.526
We expect them to understand us.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.779
We assume they do,

00:06:33.803 --> 00:06:35.939
and we expect them to read our minds.

00:06:36.717 --> 00:06:39.021
So imagine you're at a party,

00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:42.647
and you can't believe
that your friend or your spouse

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:45.474
isn't picking up on it
that you want to leave early.

00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:46.872
And you're thinking,

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.418
"I gave you the look."

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:53.211
With a stranger, we have
to start from scratch.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:54.622
We tell the whole story,

00:06:55.376 --> 00:06:58.464
we explain who the people are,
how we feel about them;

00:06:58.488 --> 00:07:00.656
we spell out all the inside jokes.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.156
And guess what?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.841
Sometimes they do
understand us a little better.

00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:07.247
OK.

00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.767
So now that we know
that talking to strangers matters,

00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.183
how does it work?

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:15.471
There are unwritten rules
we tend to follow.

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:19.291
The rules are very different
depending on what country you're in,

00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:21.008
what culture you're in.

00:07:21.032 --> 00:07:23.161
In most parts of the US,

00:07:23.185 --> 00:07:25.439
the baseline expectation in public

00:07:25.464 --> 00:07:29.588
is that we maintain a balance
between civility and privacy.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.620
This is known as civil inattention.

00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:37.023
So, imagine two people are walking
towards each other on the street.

00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:39.345
They'll glance at each other
from a distance.

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:41.351
That's the civility, the acknowledgment.

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:43.582
And then as they get closer,
they'll look away,

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.192
to give each other some space.

00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.413
In other cultures,

00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:53.344
people go to extraordinary lengths
not to interact at all.

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.767
People from Denmark tell me

00:07:56.791 --> 00:08:00.399
that many Danes are so averse
to talking to strangers,

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:03.641
that they would rather
miss their stop on the bus

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:07.016
than say "excuse me" to someone
that they need to get around.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.329
Instead, there's this elaborate
shuffling of bags

00:08:10.353 --> 00:08:13.836
and using your body to say
that you need to get past,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.691
instead of using two words.

00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:20.047
In Egypt, I'm told,

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.023
it's rude to ignore a stranger,

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:26.280
and there's a remarkable
culture of hospitality.

00:08:27.312 --> 00:08:30.368
Strangers might ask each other
for a sip of water.

00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:33.096
Or, if you ask someone for directions,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.178
they're very likely
to invite you home for coffee.

00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:40.969
We see these unwritten rules
most clearly when they're broken,

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.646
or when you're in a new place

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.867
and you're trying to figure out
what the right thing to do is.

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:52.393
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit
is where the action is.

00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:59.020
In case it's not clear,
I really want you to do this. OK?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.679
So here's how it's going to go.

00:09:01.703 --> 00:09:03.729
Find somebody who is making eye contact.

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:05.442
That's a good signal.

00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:07.609
The first thing is a simple smile.

00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:12.318
If you're passing somebody on the street
or in the hallway here, smile.

00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:13.610
See what happens.

00:09:14.113 --> 00:09:16.150
Another is triangulation.

00:09:16.552 --> 00:09:18.231
There's you, there's a stranger,

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:22.364
there's some third thing
that you both might see and comment on,

00:09:23.134 --> 00:09:25.121
like a piece of public art

00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:27.270
or somebody preaching in the street

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:29.882
or somebody wearing funny clothes.

00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:31.840
Give it a try.

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:35.848
Make a comment about that third thing,
and see if starts a conversation.

00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:38.345
Another is what I call noticing.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.328
This is usually giving a compliment.

00:09:41.003 --> 00:09:44.259
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:47.039
I'm actually not wearing
fabulous shoes right now,

00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:49.222
but shoes are fabulous in general.

00:09:49.817 --> 00:09:53.943
And they're pretty neutral
as far as giving compliments goes.

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:57.575
People always want to tell you things
about their awesome shoes.

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:01.496
You may have already experienced
the dogs and babies principle.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.938
It can be awkward
to talk to someone on the street;

00:10:03.962 --> 00:10:06.033
you don't know how
they're going to respond.

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:08.599
But you can always talk
to their dog or their baby.

00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:09.972
The dog or the baby

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.582
is a social conduit to the person,

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:15.132
and you can tell by how they respond

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.083
whether they're open to talking more.

00:10:18.156 --> 00:10:20.321
The last one I want to challenge you to

00:10:20.345 --> 00:10:21.841
is disclosure.

00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:24.890
This is a very vulnerable thing to do,

00:10:24.914 --> 00:10:26.430
and it can be very rewarding.

00:10:27.068 --> 00:10:29.160
So next time you're talking to a stranger

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:31.220
and you feel comfortable,

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:34.316
tell them something true about yourself,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.680
something really personal.

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:39.894
You might have that experience
I talked about of feeling understood.

00:10:41.854 --> 00:10:43.800
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,

00:10:43.824 --> 00:10:47.181
people ask me, "What does your dad do?"
or, "Where does he live?"

00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:49.427
And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,

00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:51.608
which is that he died when I was a kid.

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.403
Always in those moments,

00:10:55.427 --> 00:10:57.899
they share their own experiences of loss.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:01.543
We tend to meet
disclosure with disclosure,

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:02.968
even with strangers.

00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:06.105
So, here it is.

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:11.279
When you talk to strangers,
you're making beautiful interruptions

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:14.789
into the expected narrative
of your daily life

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:16.032
and theirs.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.933
You're making unexpected connections.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.983
If you don't talk to strangers,
you're missing out on all of that.

00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:27.822
We spend a lot of time

00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:30.423
teaching our children about strangers.

00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:34.657
What would happen if we spent
more time teaching ourselves?

00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:39.784
We could reject all the ideas
that make us so suspicious of each other.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:43.284
We could make a space for change.

00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:45.292
Thank you.

00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:51.222
(Applause)
